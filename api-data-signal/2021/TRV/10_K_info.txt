Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis. \n\nOverview \n\nDiluted net income per share of $14.49 in 2021 increased by 38% over diluted net income per share of $10.52 in 2020. Net income of $3.66 billion in 2021 increased by 36% over net income of $2.70 billion in 2020. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher net investment income, (ii) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\"), (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iv) higher net realized investment gains, partially offset by (v) higher catastrophe losses (net of recoveries under the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties). Catastrophe losses in 2021 and 2020 were $1.85 billion and $1.61 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2021 and 2020 was $538 million and $351 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins in 2021 were driven by Business Insurance and Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance, partially offset by Personal Insurance. Underlying underwriting margins in 2021 and 2020 reflected a net favorable impact from COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Income tax expense in 2021 was higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the increase in income before income taxes. \n\nFor discussion regarding the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company, see \"Outlook\" and \"Part I&#8212;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors.\" \n\nThe Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd&#8217;s, as well as in Brazil and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company&#8217;s net income or segment income for the periods reported. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2021 were $30.86 billion, $1.81 billion or 6% higher than in 2020. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2021 increased by 3% over 2020. Earned premiums in Business Insurance in 2021 were negatively impacted by lower net written premiums primarily in the latter half of 2020 due to a modest reduction in exposures and a decrease in new business volume, in each case impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Earned premiums in Business Insurance in 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced exposures and reductions in the Company's estimate of ultimate audit premiums receivable, in each case reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions, including a decrease in new business levels. In Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2021 increased by 11% over 2020. Earned premiums in Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance in 2021 and 2020 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2021 increased by 10% over 2020. Earned premiums in Personal Insurance in 2021 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Earned premiums in Personal Insurance in 2020 were reduced by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Factors contributing to the increase in earned premiums in each segment in 2021 as compared with 2020 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company&#8217;s investments. ##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 \n\nAverage investments (1) \n\n$ 83,574 &#160; $ 78,070 $ 74,866 Pre-tax net investment income 3,033 &#160; 2,227 2,468 After-tax net investment income 2,541 &#160; $ 1,908 2,097 \n\nAverage pre-tax yield (2) \n\n3.6 &#160; % 2.9 % 3.3 % \n\nAverage after-tax yield (2) \n\n3.0 &#160; % 2.4 % 2.8 % ##TABLE_END ___________________________________________ \n\n(1) Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income. \n\n(2) Excludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses. \n\nNet investment income in 2021 was $3.03 billion, $806 million or 36% higher than in 2020. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2021 was $1.99 billion, $22 million lower than in 2020. The decrease primarily resulted from lower long-term interest rates, partially offset by a higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2021 was $7 million, $37 million lower than in 2020. The decrease primarily resulted from lower short-term interest rates. The Company's remaining investment portfolios had net investment income of $1.08 billion in 2021, $868 million higher than in 2020, primarily due to higher private equity partnership returns. Net investment income from these investments in 2020 included the impact of the disruption in global financial markets associated with COVID-19. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis. \n\nFee Income \n\nFee income in 2021 was $402 million, $27 million lower than in 2020. The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company&#8217;s fee-based business and is discussed in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows. \n\nNet Realized Investment Gains \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company&#8217;s net pre-tax realized investment gains. \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 &#160; &#160; &#160; Credit impairment losses: Fixed maturities $ (2) $ (15) $ (4) Other investments &#8212; &#160; (40) &#8212; Net realized investment gains on equity securities still held 78 &#160; 27 61 Other net realized investment gains, including from sales 95 &#160; 30 56 Total $ 171 &#160; $ 2 $ 113 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a $40 million credit impairment loss from the other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying value of a joint venture investment included in other investments. \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2021 included $69 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $17 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities sold and $9 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments. Other net realized investment gains in 2020 included $67 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $11 million of net realized investment losses related to equity securities sold and $26 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nOther revenues in all years presented included revenues from Simply Business and installment premium charges. Installment premium charges in 2020 were reduced by billing relief actions offered to customers as a result of COVID-19. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2021 were $20.30 billion, $1.18 billion or 6% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher business volumes, (iv) higher losses in the automobile product line in Personal Insurance due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year and (v) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance, partially offset by (vi) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (vii) a net favorable impact associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions in Business Insurance and Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance in the aggregate compared to a net charge in 2020. Catastrophes in 2021 primarily resulted from Hurricane Ida, tornado activity in Kentucky, winter storms and severe wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, as well as a wildfire in Colorado. Catastrophes in 2020 primarily resulted from the derecho windstorm in the midwestern region of the United States, the Glass wildfire in California, Tropical Storm Isaias, Hurricanes Zeta and Laura, additional wildfires in the western United States, tornado activity in Tennessee, other severe wind storms and winter storms in several regions of the United States and civil unrest. Catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in 2021 were reduced by the full $350 million of recoveries available under the Company's 2021 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. Catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, including losses from wildfires, in 2020 were reduced by the full $280 million of recoveries available under the Company's 2020 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. \n\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2020 included subrogation recoveries related to wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, which are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. Factors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nSignificant Catastrophe Losses \n\nThe Company defines a &#8220;catastrophe&#8221; as an event: \n\n&#8226; that is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and \n\n&#8226; for which the Company&#8217;s estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2021 ranged from approximately $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes. \n\nThe following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in 2021 and 2020 for catastrophes that occurred in 2020 and 2019, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Losses Incurred / Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Year Reserve Development for the Year Ended December 31, Estimated Ultimate Losses at December 31, \n\n(in millions, pre-tax and net of reinsurance) (1) \n\n2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2019 PCS Serial Number: 33 &#8212; Severe wind storms (9) 8 250 249 258 250 61 &#8212; Severe wind storms and tornadoes (13) 8 109 104 117 109 2020 PCS Serial Number: 16 &#8212; Tennessee tornado activity \n\n(9) 151 n/a 142 151 n/a 19 &#8212; Severe storms \n\n(9) 134 n/a 125 134 n/a 20 &#8212; Severe storms \n\n(25) 165 n/a 140 165 n/a 33 &#8212; Civil unrest \n\n(7) 100 n/a 93 100 n/a 44 &#8212; Tropical Storm Isaias \n\n(22) 140 n/a 118 140 n/a 46 &#8212; Midwest derecho (10) 212 n/a 202 212 n/a 68 &#8212; California wildfire - Glass fire (2) \n\n(9) 145 n/a 136 145 n/a 2021 PCS Serial Number: 15 &#8212; Winter storms 228 n/a n/a 228 n/a n/a 17 &#8212; Winter storms 508 n/a n/a 508 n/a n/a 29 &#8212; Severe wind storms 105 n/a n/a 105 n/a n/a 60 &#8212; Hurricane Ida 417 n/a n/a 417 n/a n/a 76 &#8212; Tornado outbreak 131 n/a n/a 131 n/a n/a ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________ \n\n(1) Amounts are reported pre-tax and net of recoveries under all applicable reinsurance treaties, except for the Company's 2021, 2020 and 2019 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Treaties. Those treaties covered the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2021 through and \n\nincluding December 31, 2021, the period January 1, 2020 through and including December 31, 2020 and the period January 1, 2019 through and including December 31, 2019, respectively. As a result, the benefit from those treaties are not included in the table as the allocation of the treaties' benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event. \n\n(2) In addition to the Glass fire, there were 16 other PCS-designated wildfires in 2020. While none of the 16 wildfires were individually large enough to meet the Company's threshold for disclosure as a significant catastrophe in this table, total losses in 2020 from those wildfires were $169 million, of which two wildfires totaling $73 million met the Company's threshold for disclosure as catastrophes. \n\nn/a: not applicable. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2021 was $5.04 billion, $270 million or 6% higher than in 2020. The increase in 2021 was consistent with the increase in earned premiums. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2021 were $4.68 billion, $168 million or 4% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes. The benefit of lower net expenses related to COVID-19 and related economic conditions in 2021 was higher than in 2020. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense in 2021 and 2020 was $340 million and $339 million, respectively. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2021 was $796 million, $256 million or 47% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the $1.22 billion increase in income before income taxes in 2021. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 18% and 17% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The increase in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher net investment income, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins and (iii) net favorable prior year reserve development of $173 million in 2021 compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $91 million in 2020, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses (net of recoveries under the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties). Catastrophe losses in 2021 and 2020 were $793 million and $645 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, (ii) a favorable impact associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions and (iii) higher business volumes. Income tax expense in 2021 was higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the increase in segment income before income taxes. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2021 were $15.73 billion, $440 million or 3% higher than in 2020. Earned premiums in 2021 were negatively impacted by lower net written premiums primarily in the latter half of 2020 due to a modest reduction in exposures and a decrease in new business volume, in each case impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Earned premiums in 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced exposures and reductions in the Company's estimate of ultimate audit premiums receivable, in each case reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions, including a decrease in new business levels. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income in 2021 was $2.27 billion, $632 million or 39% higher than in 2020.

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in both 2021 and 2020 included favorable loss activity related to the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in 2021 and 2020 were reduced by recoveries under the Company's Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties. \n\nNet unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2020 included the favorable impact of subrogation recoveries related to wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018. Factors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2021 was $2.58 billion, $63 million or 3% higher than in 2020, consistent with the increase in earned premiums. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2021 were $2.75 billion, $82 million or 3% higher than in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily in support of business growth. General and administrative expenses in both 2021 and 2020 included the benefit of lower travel-related expenses attributable to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. General and administrative expenses in 2020 also included an increased allowance for expected credit losses on premiums receivable attributable to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2021 was $499 million, $286 million or 134% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the $1.36 billion increase in income before income taxes in 2021. \n\nCombined Ratio \n\nThe combined ratio of 95.7% in 2021 was 4.6 points lower than the combined ratio of 100.3% in 2020.

Installment premium charges in 2021 were higher than in 2020, primarily attributable to the impact of billing relief actions offered to customers as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2021 were $8.43 billion, $1.57 billion or 23% higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher losses in the automobile product line due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year, (ii) higher business volumes, (iii) loss cost trends, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (v) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line and (vi) higher catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, in both 2021 and 2020, were reduced by recoveries under the Company's Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance treaties. \n\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2020 primarily resulted from subrogation recoveries related to wildfires in \n\nCalifornia in 2017 and 2018. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2021 was $1.89 billion, $156 million or 9% higher than in 2020, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2021 were $1.37 billion, $56 million or 4% higher than in 2020. The increase in 2021 primarily reflected higher business volumes. The total in 2020 included an increased allowance for expected credit losses on premiums receivable due to the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2021 was $179 million, $129 million or 42% lower than in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the $564 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2021. \n\nCombined Ratio \n\nThe combined ratio of 96.5% in 2021 was 6.8 points higher than the combined ratio of 89.7% in 2020. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 70.3% in 2021 was 7.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 62.8% in 2020. The underwriting expense ratio of 26.2% in 2021 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 26.9% in 2020. \n\nCatastrophe losses accounted for 8.5 points and 8.8 points of the combined ratio in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2021 and 2020 provided 2.2 points and 4.1 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2021 was 5.2 points higher than the 2020 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher losses in the automobile product line due to a comparison to a low level of loss activity (net of premium refunds) in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in the current year and (ii) higher losses in the homeowners and other product line. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nPersonal Insurance&#8217;s gross and net written premiums were as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Gross Written Premiums (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Domestic: &#160; &#160; &#160; Automobile $ 5,852 &#160; $ 5,395 $ 5,443 Homeowners and Other 6,137 &#160; 5,457 4,814 Total Domestic 11,989 &#160; 10,852 10,257 International 701 &#160; 667 724 Total Personal Insurance $ 12,690 &#160; $ 11,519 $ 10,981 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Net Written Premiums (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Domestic: &#160; &#160; &#160; Automobile $ 5,827 &#160; $ 5,369 $ 5,412 Homeowners and Other 5,980 &#160; 5,329 4,664 Total Domestic 11,807 &#160; 10,698 10,076 International 684 &#160; 652 707 Total Personal Insurance $ 12,491 &#160; $ 11,350 $ 10,783 ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2021 both increased by 10% over 2020. Gross and net written premiums in 2021 were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Gross and net written premiums in 2020 were negatively impacted by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. \n\nDomestic \n\nAutomobile net written premiums of $5.83 billion in 2021 increased by 9% over 2020. Net written premiums in 2020 were negatively impacted by premium refunds provided to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Retention rates remained strong in 2021. Renewal premium changes in 2021 were not significant and were lower than in the same periods of 2020. New business premiums in 2021 increased over 2020. \n\nHomeowners and Other net written premiums of $5.98 billion in 2021 increased by 12% over 2020. Retention rates remained strong in 2021. Renewal premium changes in 2021 remained positive and were higher than in 2020. New business premiums in 2021 increased over 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor its Domestic business, Personal Insurance had approximately 8.9 million and 8.4 million active policies at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nInternational \n\nInternational net written premiums of $684 million in 2021 increased by 5% over 2020, primarily driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nFor its International business, Personal Insurance had approximately 477,000 and 491,000 active policies at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nInterest Expense and Other \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Income (loss) $ (291) $ (291) $ (297) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Income (loss) for Interest Expense and Other in both 2021 and 2020 was $(291) million. Pre-tax interest expense in 2021 and 2020 was $340 million and $339 million, respectively. After-tax interest expense in 2021 and 2020 was $269 million and $268 million, respectively. \n\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants, such as manufacturers of talcum powder, who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company&#8217;s asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. \n\nThe Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy, over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. \n\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers&#8217; conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be filed in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. \n\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder with open claims at least annually. Among the factors the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder&#8217;s potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. \n\nThe Company's net asbestos reserves at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1.34 billion, and include case reserves, IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing policyholders, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Asbestos reserves also include amounts related to certain policyholders with whom the Company has entered into permanent settlement agreements, which are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Additionally, a portion of the asbestos reserves \n\nrelates to assumed reinsurance contracts primarily consisting of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. \n\nThe Company conducts an annual review of domestic policyholders with open asbestos claims. Policyholders are identified for this review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential &#8220;non-product&#8221; exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of policyholders with open claims and litigation cases for potential product and \"non-product\" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends: \n\n&#8226; a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims; \n\n&#8226; while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the high level of litigation activity; and \n\n&#8226; a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity. \n\nBoth the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims and net asbestos-related payments decreased slightly when compared to 2020. Payments on behalf of these policyholders continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders and the assumed reinsurance component of reserves, as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company&#8217;s evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. \n\nThe completion of these reviews and analyses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 resulted in $225 million, $295 million and $220 million increases, respectively, to the Company&#8217;s net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company&#8217;s estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs primarily resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the continued high level of mesothelioma claim filings and the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding those claims discussed above. Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company&#8217;s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company&#8217;s overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims. \n\nNet asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $221 million, $237 million and $224 million, respectively. Approximately 9%, 1% and 4% of total net paid losses in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company entered into settlement agreements that limit those policyholders' ability to present future claims to the Company. \n\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves: ##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross $ 1,668 &#160; $ 1,601 $ 1,608 Ceded (330) (322) (327) Net 1,338 &#160; 1,279 1,281 Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross 287 &#160; 362 268 Ceded (62) (67) (48) Net 225 &#160; 295 220 Paid loss and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross 267 &#160; 295 277 Ceded (46) (58) (53) Net 221 &#160; 237 224 Foreign exchange and other: &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross (1) &#8212; 2 Ceded &#8212; &#160; 1 &#8212; Net (1) 1 2 Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross 1,687 &#160; 1,668 1,601 Ceded (346) (330) (322) Net $ 1,341 &#160; $ 1,338 $ 1,279 ##TABLE_END\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of the alleged storage, emissions or disposal of toxic substances, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions pertaining to environmental claims have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. For more information regarding environmental claims and litigation, see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $89 million, $54 million and $76 million, respectively. Net environmental paid loss and loss expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $75 million, $69 million and $90 million, respectively. Net environmental reserves were $321 million, $307 million and $321 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \n\nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES \n\nAs a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management&#8217;s judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation: \n\n&#8226; the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation; \n\n&#8226; a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated; \n\n&#8226; the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements; \n\n&#8226; the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued; \n\n&#8226; the resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these disputes; \n\n&#8226; the number and outcome of direct actions against us; \n\n&#8226; future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims; \n\n&#8226; any impact on asbestos defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos defendants; \n\n&#8226; the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and \n\n&#8226; uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders. \n\nChanges in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. \n\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company&#8217;s current reserves. In addition, the Company&#8217;s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company&#8217;s operating results in future periods. \n\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO \n\nThe Company&#8217;s invested assets at December 31, 2021 were $87.38 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \n\nThe carrying value of the Company&#8217;s fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2021 was $77.81 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company&#8217;s insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company&#8217;s fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was &#8220;Aa2&#8221; at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Below investment grade securities represented 1.4% and 1.8% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.2 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2021 and 3.8 (4.0 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2020. \n\nThe carrying values of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2021 2020 (at December 31, in millions) Carrying Value Weighted Average Credit Quality (1) Carrying Value Weighted Average Credit Quality (1) U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities \n\n$ 3,562 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 $ 2,149 Aaa/Aa1 Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions: \n\n&#160; &#160; Local general obligation 19,667 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 18,657 Aaa/Aa1 Revenue 11,940 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 12,715 Aaa/Aa1 State general obligation 1,223 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 1,444 Aaa/Aa1 Pre-refunded 4,032 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 3,544 Aaa/Aa1 Total obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions \n\n36,862 &#160; 36,360 &#160; Debt securities issued by foreign governments 1,041 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 1,054 Aaa/Aa1 Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities \n\n1,817 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 2,361 Aaa/Aa1 All other corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stock: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Financial: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Bank 4,473 &#160; A1 3,993 A1 Insurance 1,626 &#160; Aa3 1,380 Aa3 Finance/leasing 34 &#160; Ba3 22 Ba3 Brokerage and asset management 101 &#160; Aa3 94 Aa3 Total financial 6,234 &#160; &#160; 5,489 &#160; Industrial 19,459 &#160; A3 17,883 A3 Public utility 4,706 &#160; A2 4,255 A2 Canadian municipal securities 1,687 &#160; Aa2 1,653 Aa2 Sovereign corporate securities (2) \n\n607 &#160; Aaa 609 Aaa Commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans (3) \n\n1,304 &#160; Aaa 1,418 Aaa Asset-backed and other 531 &#160; Aa1 772 Aa1 Total all other corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stock \n\n34,528 &#160; 32,079 &#160; Total fixed maturities $ 77,810 &#160; Aa2 $ 74,003 Aa2 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________ \n\n(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. \n\n(2) Sovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the Federal Ship Financing Programs. \n\n(3) Included in commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $207 million and $392 million of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, respectively. \n\nThe following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2021, in millions) Carrying Value Percent of Total Carrying Value Quality Rating: &#160; &#160; Aaa $ 33,323 &#160; 42.8 &#160; % Aa 18,140 &#160; 23.3 &#160; A 14,757 &#160; 19.0 &#160; Baa 10,483 &#160; 13.5 &#160; Total investment grade 76,703 &#160; 98.6 &#160; Below investment grade 1,107 &#160; 1.4 &#160; Total fixed maturities $ 77,810 &#160; 100.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nObligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $36.86 billion and $36.36 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $4.03 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company&#8217;s holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have either been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities or have FHA guarantees subject to federal appropriation. \n\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the $32.83 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2021 that were not pre-refunded: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2021, in millions) State General Obligation Local General Obligation Revenue Total Carrying Value Weighted Average Credit Quality(1) State: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Texas $ 33 &#160; $ 3,340 &#160; $ 1,435 &#160; $ 4,808 &#160; Aaa California &#8212; &#160; 2,071 &#160; 489 &#160; 2,560 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Virginia 61 &#160; 1,086 &#160; 878 &#160; 2,025 &#160; Aaa Washington 143 &#160; 1,368 &#160; 366 &#160; 1,877 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 North Carolina 200 &#160; 821 &#160; 543 &#160; 1,564 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Minnesota 133 &#160; 1,159 &#160; 184 &#160; 1,476 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Colorado &#8212; &#160; 908 &#160; 409 &#160; 1,317 &#160; Aa1 Massachusetts &#8212; &#160; 177 &#160; 1,028 &#160; 1,205 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Maryland 33 &#160; 936 &#160; 109 &#160; 1,078 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Florida 60 &#160; 172 &#160; 720 &#160; 952 &#160; Aa1 Georgia 161 &#160; 654 &#160; 116 &#160; 931 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Tennessee 22 &#160; 781 &#160; 108 &#160; 911 &#160; Aa1 Wisconsin 47 &#160; 678 &#160; 139 &#160; 864 &#160; Aa1 All others (2) \n\n330 &#160; 5,516 &#160; 5,416 &#160; 11,262 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Total $ 1,223 &#160; $ 19,667 &#160; $ 11,940 &#160; $ 32,830 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________ \n\n(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.

The table includes $434 million of short-term securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated &#8220;A-1+&#8221; and/or &#8220;P-1,&#8221; are included as &#8220;Aaa&#8221; rated securities. \n\nIn addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $300 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $206 million to these partnerships. \n\nMortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $1.82 billion and $2.36 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company&#8217;s investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company&#8217;s investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company&#8217;s assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company&#8217;s investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans \n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $1.30 billion and $1.42 billion, respectively. For more information regarding the Company&#8217;s investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nEquity Securities, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes. \n\nOther Investments \n\nThe Company also invests in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than investments in fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. The Company also enters into certain derivative financial instruments from time to time that are reported as part of other investments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.86 billion and $3.40 billion, respectively. The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships, real estate partnerships and others in which it invests. These commitments totaled $1.70 billion and $1.72 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. It is the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet these commitments. \n\nSecurities Lending \n\nThe Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $253 million and $139 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2021 and 2020 was $329 million and $254 million, respectively. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. The Company did not incur any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\nLloyd&#8217;s Trust Deposits \n\nThe Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd&#8217;s using a combination of the share capital and retained earnings of the Company's subsidiaries participating in Lloyd's, trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $33 million and $119 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $34 million and $35 million held by TRV at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were pledged into Lloyd&#8217;s trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd&#8217;s capital requirements. For more information regarding the Company&#8217;s utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; herein. \n\nNet Unrealized Investment Gains \n\nThe net unrealized investment gains that were included in shareholders' equity were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Fixed maturities $ 3,062 &#160; $ 5,175 $ 2,853 Other (2) &#8212; &#8212; Unrealized investment gains before tax 3,060 &#160; 5,175 2,853 Tax expense 645 &#160; 1,101 607 Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at end of year $ 2,415 &#160; $ 4,074 $ 2,246 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet unrealized investment gains included in shareholders&#8217; equity at December 31, 2021 decreased by $1.66 billion from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in interest rates during 2021. Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. \n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had no fixed maturity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost. \n\nFor fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity. \n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, below investment grade securities comprised 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company&#8217;s fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2021 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $239 million and a fair value of $232 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $7 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of both the amortized cost and fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2021 and accounted for approximately 2% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2021. \n\nImpairment Charges \n\nImpairment charges included in net realized investment gains in the consolidated statement of income were $2 million and $55 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total in 2020 included a $40 million other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying value of an equity method investment included in other investments. See note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nPurchases and Sales of Investment Securities \n\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company&#8217;s ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred pre-tax realized losses of $5 million on the sale of fixed maturity investments having a fair value of $488 million. \n\nCATASTROPHE MODELING \n\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable. \n\nThe Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors, including non-modeled losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are updated regularly as new information and techniques emerge. \n\nThe tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax, and as a percentage of the Company&#8217;s common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2021. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company&#8217;s loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $2.0 billion, or 8% of the Company&#8217;s common equity at December 31, 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Dollars (in billions) Likelihood of Exceedance (1) Single U.S. and Canadian Hurricane Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake 2.0% (1-in-50) $ 1.5 &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; 1.0% (1-in-100) $ 2.0 &#160; $ 0.7 &#160; 0.4% (1-in-250) $ 2.5 &#160; $ 1.2 &#160; 0.1% (1-in-1,000) $ 6.4 &#160; $ 1.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Percentage of Common Equity (2) Likelihood of Exceedance Single U.S. and Canadian Hurricane Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake 2.0% (1-in-50) 6 &#160; % 2 &#160; % 1.0% (1-in-100) 8 &#160; % 3 &#160; % 0.4% (1-in-250) 9 &#160; % 4 &#160; % 0.1% (1-in-1,000) 24 &#160; % 6 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________ \n\n(1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a &#8220;1-in-50 year event.&#8221; As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. \n\n(2) &#160; The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders&#8217; equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company&#8217;s financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions. \n\nThe threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company&#8217;s in-force portfolio at December 31, 2021 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1, 2022, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company&#8217;s reinsurance, see &#8220;Item 1-Business-Reinsurance.&#8221; The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company&#8217;s catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers&#8217; compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts. \n\nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. \n\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers&#8217; compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events. \n\nIn addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes, hail storms wildfires and winter storms are \n\nnewer and may be less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. Accordingly, these models may be less accurate in predicting risks and estimating losses. Further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. As compared to natural catastrophes, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is even more difficult and less reliable, and for some events (both natural and man-made), models are either in early stages of development and, therefore, not widely adopted, or are not available. \n\nFor more information about the Company&#8217;s exposure to catastrophe losses, see &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors - High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A-Risk Factors- We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.&#8221; \n\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS \n\nSevere weather events over the last two decades underscore the unpredictability of climate trends, and changing climate conditions have added to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. The insurance industry has experienced increased catastrophe losses due to a number of potential causal factors, including, in addition to weather/climate variability, aging infrastructure, more people living in high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker enforcement of building codes, urban expansion, an increase in the number of amenities included in, and average size of, a home and increased inflation, including as a results of post-event demand surge. For example, the frequency and severity of tornado and hail events in the United States have been more volatile during this time period. In addition, climate studies by government agencies, academic institutions, catastrophe modeling organizations and other groups indicate that we are experiencing, and are expected to continue to experience over time, an increase in frequency and/or intensity of hurricanes, heavy precipitation events, flash flooding, sea level rise, droughts, heat waves and wildfires. Understanding the potential impacts of changing climate conditions is important to the Company's business. Changing climate conditions are expected to evolve over decades. Importantly, because most of its policies renew annually, the Company is able to respond to these changes over time through adjustments to its underwriting strategy, product pricing and related policy terms and conditions, as appropriate. As an example, in recent years the Company has focused on enhancing the strategic management of its catastrophe exposure, adding experts in data science, meteorology, geophysics and environmental engineering, among others, to its catastrophe management organization. The Company also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril, with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. These results have been incorporated into the Company&#8217;s product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation and claim response. \n\nThe Company discusses how changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors.&#8221; and &#8220;Outlook.&#8221; For example, among other things: \n\n&#8226; Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance&#8221; and &#8220;-Outlook-Underwriting Gain/Loss.&#8221; Moreover, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events, emerging trends in climate conditions and regulatory responses to catastrophe events not being appropriately reflected in the models, in addition to the other factors mentioned above. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. \n\n&#8226; Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southwestern United States; more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southeastern United States, among other areas; and increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions could impact the creditworthiness of issuers affects by such regulations. In addition, as issuers of securities in which the Company invests become increasingly focused on mitigating the potential environmental impact of their operations, the costs associated with such initiatives could affect the business models and realized returns of such issuers. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses.&#8221; \n\n&#8226; Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company&#8217;s ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. For example, one state passed legislation that restricted a carrier's ability to cancel or non-renew certain policies within or adjacent to declared state of emergency zip codes. If the Company is unable to implement risk-based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See &#8220;Item 1&#8212;Business&#8212;U.S. State and Federal Regulation&#8212;Regulatory and Legislative Responses to Catastrophes.&#8221; In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses. \n\n&#8226; The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. For example, from time to time third parties sue our policyholders alleging that they caused or contributed to changing climate conditions. Through the Company&#8217;s Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews emerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after we issue our policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.&#8221; \n\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES \n\nThe Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For additional discussion regarding the Company&#8217;s reinsurance coverage, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1&#8212;Business&#8212;Reinsurance.&#8221; \n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company&#8217;s reinsurance recoverables: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 3,931 &#160; $ 3,731 Gross structured settlements 2,900 &#160; 2,964 Mandatory pools and associations 1,762 &#160; 1,801 Gross reinsurance recoverables 8,593 &#160; 8,496 Allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance (141) (146) Net reinsurance recoverables $ 8,452 &#160; $ 8,350 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2021 increased by $102 million from December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of catastrophe losses in 2021, partially offset by a lower level of structured settlements and recoverables from mandatory pools and associations. \n\nThe following table presents the Company&#8217;s top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2021 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant reinsurer from each such reinsurer group at February 17, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Reinsurer Group Reinsurance Recoverable A.M.

In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company&#8217;s top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2021 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company&#8217;s predominant insurer from each such insurer group at February 17, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Group Structured Settlements A.M.

The Company&#8217;s earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nOverall, the Company expects that retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2022. \n\nProperty and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2022 for new business. In each of the Company&#8217;s business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. In periods of meaningful decreases in new business, despite its negative impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of lower new business levels may positively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The Company&#8217;s underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss trend, including as a result of COVID-19 and related economic conditions; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments. \n\nCatastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company&#8217;s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur. \n\nOn average for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced approximately 40% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company's reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates. \n\nOver much of the past decade, the Company&#8217;s results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year. \n\nIt is possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by federal, state and/or local governments and the Federal Reserve could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company&#8217;s loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. Labor shortages, higher costs of used vehicles and parts, and increased demand and decreased supply for raw materials are adversely impacting severity in our auto and property businesses and may continue to do so in future quarters. For a further discussion, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.&#8221; \n\nEconomic conditions and therefore the Company&#8217;s results of operations may be impacted by a variety of other factors as well, many of which could continue to be affected by COVID-19, such as the pace of the economic recovery, financial market volatility, supply chain disruptions, extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the political and regulatory environment, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and potential changes in tax laws. \n\nInvestment Portfolio . The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.2 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2021. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company regularly evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company&#8217;s investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \n\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, and private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for greater volatility and higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. \n\nApproximately 29% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (including the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). As a result, the overall yield on and composition of its portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for reinvestment with the proceeds of maturing bonds. \n\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company&#8217;s results of operations. Based on our current expectations for slightly higher levels of fixed income investments, partially offset by the impact of expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed income investments, the Company expects that after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $430 million to $440 million for each quarter of 2022. This expectation could be impacted by disruptions in global financial markets. \n\nIncluded in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income or loss from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis. Net investment income from these other investments was particularly strong during 2021 reflecting strong global financial market performance. Given the particularly strong 2021 performance, the Company expects that net investment income from these other investments in 2022 will be significantly lower than in 2021. The Company&#8217;s net investment income in future periods from its non-fixed income investment portfolio will be impacted, positively or negatively, by the performance of global financial markets. \n\nThe Company had net pre-tax realized investment gains of $171 million in 2021. Changes in global financial markets could result in net realized investment gains or losses in the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $3.06 billion ($2.42 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2021. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders&#8217; equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. Additionally, disruptions in global financial markets could also impact the market value of the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio.

The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders, subject to the considerations described below. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the level of capital to support the Company's financial strength ratings will also increase, and accordingly, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the Company&#8217;s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company&#8217;s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company&#8217;s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company&#8217;s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws and other factors. For information regarding the Company&#8217;s common share repurchases in 2021, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; herein. S&#38;P has announced that it intends to change its capital adequacy model. While the proposed model has not been finalized, it could increase the level of capital S&#38;P requires for a particular financial strength rating. As part of its capital management strategy, the Company will continue to make its own assessment of the appropriate level of capital to support the Company&#8217;s business operations. See the risk factor entitled &#8220;A downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs&#8221; included in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nAs a result of the Company&#8217;s business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom (including Lloyd&#8217;s), the Republic of Ireland and in Brazil through a joint venture, the Company&#8217;s capital is also subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction in shareholders&#8217; equity, while a weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in an \n\nincrease in shareholders' equity. For additional discussion of the Company&#8217;s foreign exchange market risk exposure, see &#8220;Part II&#8212;Item 7A&#8212;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; \n\nMany of the statements in this &#8220;Outlook&#8221; section and in &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. See &#8220;&#8212;Forward Looking Statements.&#8221; For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial position, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates.&#8221; \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during 2021. For further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company's liquidity and capital resources, see &#8220;The ongoing impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity&#8221; included in &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8221;. \n\nLiquidity is a measure of a company&#8217;s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed. \n\nOperating Company Liquidity. The liquidity requirements of the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The insurance subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management that the insurance subsidiaries&#8217; future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above. Subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Company&#8217;s principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which, in turn, pay dividends to the corporate holding (parent) company (TRV). For further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries, see &#8220;Part I&#8212;Item 1&#8212;Business&#8212;Regulation.&#8221; \n\nHolding Company Liquidity . TRV&#8217;s liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. At December 31, 2021, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating $1.53 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 28 days. TRV has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common shareholder dividends (currently approximately $1.18 billion). TRV&#8217;s holding company liquidity of $1.53 billion at December 31, 2021 exceeded this target, and it is the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV&#8217;s current liquidity requirements. \n\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company&#8217;s foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company&#8217;s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2021. \n\nTRV has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 10, 2022 which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 4, 2023. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding. TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. The Company has no senior notes or junior subordinated debentures maturing until April 2026, at which time $200 million of senior notes will mature. \n\nThe Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of $279 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations at Lloyd&#8217;s at December 31, 2021. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd&#8217;s, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand. \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities were $7.27 billion and $6.52 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in cash flows in 2021 primarily reflected the impacts of higher levels of cash received for premiums and net investment income, partially offset by higher levels of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commissions. The increase in cash received for premiums in 2021 compared to the prior year was impacted by premium refunds provided primarily in 2020 to personal automobile customers in response to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. The increase in cash paid for claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2021 reflected the impact in 2020 of COVID-19 and related economic conditions, such as lower loss payments in the automobile product line due to a decrease in miles driven. Both years were impacted by reduced judicial system and claims settlement activity related to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Cash paid for claims and claim adjustment expenses in the prior year also benefited from $380 million of subrogation recoveries from PG&#38;E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires received in 2020. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $5.20 billion and $4.89 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company&#8217;s consolidated total investments at December 31, 2021 increased by $2.95 billion, or 3% over December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of (i) net cash flows provided by operating activities, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in net unrealized gains on investments at December 31, 2021 as compared with December 31, 2020, due to the impact of higher interest rates during 2021, and (iii) net cash used in financing activities. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary goals of the Company&#8217;s asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company&#8217;s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company&#8217;s insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company&#8217;s ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash used in financing activities were $2.04 billion and $1.42 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The totals in both 2021 and 2020 reflected common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and employee stock option exercises. The total in 2020 also included the payment of $500 million of maturing debt. Common share repurchases in 2021 and 2020 were $2.20 billion and $672 million, respectively. \n\nDebt Transactions . \n\n2021. On June 8, 2021, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.05% senior notes that will mature on June 8, 2051. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company, totaled approximately $739 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 8 and December 8. Prior to December 8, 2050, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company&#8217;s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to but excluding December 8, 2050 on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 15 basis points. On or after December 8, 2050, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company&#8217;s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \n\n2020. On April 27, 2020, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.55% senior notes that will mature on April 27, 2050. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company, totaled approximately $490 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 27 and October 27. Prior to October 27, 2049, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company&#8217;s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to but excluding October 27, 2049 on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) \n\ndiscounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 25 basis points. On or after October 27, 2049, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company&#8217;s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \n\nOn November 1, 2020, the Company's $500 million, 3.90% senior notes matured and were fully paid. \n\nDividends. &#160; Dividends paid to shareholders were $869 million and $861 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company&#8217;s common stock will be at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company&#8217;s financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company&#8217;s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. On January 20, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share, payable March 31, 2022 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2022. \n\nShare Repurchases. &#160; The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The most recent authorization was approved by the Board of Directors on April 20, 2021 and added $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity to the $805 million capacity remaining at that date. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company&#8217;s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company&#8217;s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company&#8217;s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company&#8217;s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. During 2021, the Company repurchased 13.9 million shares under its share repurchase authorization, for a total of $2.16 billion. The average cost per share repurchased was $154.79. Common share repurchases in 2021 were higher than the total of $625 million in 2020, due, in part, to uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions in 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $4.01 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization. \n\nFrom the inception of the first authorization on May 2, 2006 through December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 526.9 million shares for a total of $36.99 billion, or an average of $70.21 per share. \n\nIn both 2021 and 2020, the Company acquired 0.3 million shares of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the price of certain stock options that were exercised. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nCapital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company&#8217;s capital structure at December 31, 2021 and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) 2021 2020 Debt: &#160; &#160; Short-term $ 100 &#160; $ 100 Long-term 7,254 &#160; 6,504 Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs (64) (54) Total debt 7,290 &#160; 6,550 Shareholders&#8217; equity: &#160; &#160; Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock 27,694 &#160; 26,699 Accumulated other comprehensive income 1,193 &#160; 2,502 Total shareholders&#8217; equity 28,887 &#160; 29,201 Total capitalization $ 36,177 &#160; $ 35,751 ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal capitalization at December 31, 2021 was $36.18 billion, $426 million higher than at December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net income of $3.66 billion and (ii) proceeds from the exercise of employee share options of $293 million, partially offset by (iii) common share repurchases totaling $2.16 billion under the Company&#8217;s share repurchase authorization, (iv) other comprehensive loss of $1.31 billion, primarily reflecting the decrease in net unrealized appreciation on investments due to an increase in interest rates during 2021, and (v) shareholder dividends of $876 million. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization presented in the foregoing table to total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Total capitalization $ 36,177 &#160; $ 35,751 Less: net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity 2,415 &#160; 4,074 Total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity $ 33,762 &#160; $ 31,677 Debt-to-total capital ratio 20.2 &#160; % 18.3 % Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity 21.6 &#160; % 20.7 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders&#8217; equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders&#8217; equity. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate movements and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company&#8217;s financial leverage position. The Company&#8217;s ratio of debt-to-total capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders&#8217; equity of 21.6% at December 31, 2021 was within the Company&#8217;s target range of 15% to 25%. \n\nCredit Agreement . The Company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 4, 2023. Terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nShelf Registration . The Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 10, 2022 for the potential offering and sale of securities. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering. \n\nShare Repurchase Authorization. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $4.01 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors. \n\nCash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s future payments under material contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim-related payments. The table includes only liabilities at December 31, 2021 that are expected to be settled in cash. \n\nThe table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments has unavoidable estimation uncertainty. \n\nThe material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations at December 31, 2021 were as follows: ##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Debt &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Senior notes $ 7,000 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 200 &#160; $ 6,800 &#160; Junior subordinated debentures 254 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 254 &#160; Total debt principal 7,254 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 200 &#160; 7,054 &#160; Interest 6,919 &#160; 348 &#160; 696 &#160; 689 &#160; 5,186 &#160; Total long-term debt obligations (1) \n\n14,173 &#160; 348 &#160; 696 &#160; 889 &#160; 12,240 &#160; \n\nReal estate and other operating leases (2) \n\n372 &#160; 100 &#160; 149 &#160; 80 &#160; 43 &#160; Information systems-related commitments (3) \n\n486 &#160; 285 &#160; 162 &#160; 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-term unfunded investment commitments (4) \n\n1,699 &#160; 349 &#160; 558 &#160; 547 &#160; 245 &#160; Estimated claims and claim-related payments \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expenses (5) \n\n55,197 &#160; 12,064 &#160; 13,858 &#160; 7,082 &#160; 22,193 &#160; Claims from large deductible policies (6) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total estimated claims and claim-related payments \n\n55,197 &#160; 12,064 &#160; 13,858 &#160; 7,082 &#160; 22,193 &#160; Total $ 71,927 &#160; $ 13,146 &#160; $ 15,423 &#160; $ 8,637 &#160; $ 34,721 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________________________________ \n\n(1) See note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding indebtedness. Because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest, the total long-term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note 9. \n\n(2) Represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space, equipment and furniture. \n\n(3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software (including software as a service), software maintenance services and technology-related costs. \n\n(4) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships, real estate partnerships and other, as well as a put/call option entered into by the Company in connection with a business acquisition. \n\n(5) The amounts in &#8220;Claims and claim adjustment expenses&#8221; in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies. \n\nThe Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note 6 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. The assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities. \n\nThe estimated future cash inflows from the Company&#8217;s reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Reinsurance recoverables $ 5,418 &#160; $ 1,061 &#160; $ 1,091 &#160; $ 651 &#160; $ 2,615 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses on a net of reinsurance basis. The estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Claims and claim adjustment expenses, net \n\n$ 49,779 &#160; $ 11,003 &#160; $ 12,767 &#160; $ 6,431 &#160; $ 19,578 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2021. \n\nThe amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company&#8217;s balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\n(6) Workers&#8217; compensation large deductible policies provide third-party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. &#8220;Claims from large deductible policies&#8221; represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as &#8220;contractholder payables&#8221; and &#8220;contractholder receivables,&#8221; respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder&#8217;s escrow, which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within &#8220;Claims and claim adjustment expenses&#8221; in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table. \n\nThe estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables (net of allowance for expected credit losses) for workers&#8217; compensation policies is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years Contractholder payables/receivables $ 3,890 &#160; $ 1,121 &#160; $ 1,109 &#160; $ 531 &#160; $ 1,129 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company is not currently subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table. \n\nThe Company believes that the combination of operating company liquidity, holding company liquidity, its investment portfolio and its capital resources are sufficient to meet its contractual obligations. \n\nDividend Availability \n\nThe Company&#8217;s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut. The insurance holding company laws of Connecticut applicable to the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer&#8217;s statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer&#8217;s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $3.08 billion is available by the end of 2022 for such dividends to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2022 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2022, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department. \n\nIn addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the Company&#8217;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company&#8217;s shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company&#8217;s foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company&#8217;s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2021. \n\nTRV and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received dividends of $2.18 billion and $2.00 billion from their U.S. insurance subsidiaries in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified domestic pension plan), which covers substantially all U.S. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees. \n\nThe qualified domestic pension plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified domestic pension plan for 2022 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2023. The Company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there was no minimum funding requirement for the qualified domestic pension plan. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company made no voluntary contributions to the qualified domestic pension plan. The qualified domestic pension plan had a funded status of 116% and 107% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on its funded status at December 31, 2021, the Company does not currently anticipate making a voluntary contribution to the qualified domestic pension plan in 2022. In determining future contributions, the Company will consider the performance of the plan&#8217;s investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the Company&#8217;s other capital requirements. \n\nThe qualified domestic pension plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. The Company&#8217;s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. For 2022, the Company plans to apply an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50%, comparable with 2021. The expected rate of return reflects the Company&#8217;s current expectations with regard to long-term returns in the capital markets, taking into account the pension plan&#8217;s asset allocation targets, the historical performance and current valuation of U.S. and international equities, and the level of long term interest rate and inflation expectations. \n\nFor further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nRisk-Based Capital \n\nThe NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. The Company&#8217;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders&#8217; surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Each of the Company&#8217;s U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders&#8217; surplus at December 31, 2021 significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would occur. Regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Company&#8217;s foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies written. Each of the Company&#8217;s foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2021. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nThe Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. See note 17 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not believe it is reasonably likely that these arrangements will have a material current or future effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and impairments of investments, goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves \n\nGross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (in millions) Case IBNR Total Case IBNR Total General liability $ 5,351 &#160; $ 8,863 &#160; $ 14,214 &#160; $ 5,267 $ 8,098 $ 13,365 Commercial property 1,220 &#160; 392 &#160; 1,612 &#160; 1,006 366 1,372 Commercial multi-peril 2,404 &#160; 2,573 &#160; 4,977 &#160; 2,354 2,311 4,665 Commercial automobile 2,594 &#160; 2,335 &#160; 4,929 &#160; 2,551 2,231 4,782 Workers&#8217; compensation 10,152 &#160; 9,551 &#160; 19,703 &#160; 10,271 9,514 19,785 Fidelity and surety 188 &#160; 436 &#160; 624 &#160; 215 317 532 Personal automobile 2,062 &#160; 1,765 &#160; 3,827 &#160; 1,901 1,514 3,415 Personal homeowners and other 1,021 &#160; 1,395 &#160; 2,416 &#160; 901 1,168 2,069 International and other 2,525 &#160; 2,070 &#160; 4,595 &#160; 2,565 1,960 4,525 Property-casualty 27,517 &#160; 29,380 &#160; 56,897 &#160; 27,031 27,479 54,510 Accident and health 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; 11 &#8212; 11 Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves \n\n$ 27,527 &#160; $ 29,380 &#160; $ 56,907 &#160; $ 27,042 $ 27,479 $ 54,521 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $2.39 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2020 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher volumes of insured exposures, (ii) catastrophe losses in 2021, (iii) loss cost trends for the current \n\naccident year and (iv) reduced claim settlement activity largely due to continued disruptions in the judicial system related to COVID-19. \n\nAsbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see &#8220;Asbestos Claims and Litigation,&#8221; &#8220;Environmental Claims and Litigation&#8221; and &#8220;Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves&#8221; herein. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management&#8217;s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods. These estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and subrogation. Estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in &#8220;Reinsurance Recoverables&#8221; as an asset on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. \n\nThe process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, changes in the tort environment, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. The Company refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded-favorable or unfavorable. Because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and the application of judgment, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. \n\nThere are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge. \n\nA portion of the Company&#8217;s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $2.04 billion at December 31, 2021) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs&#8217; expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company&#8217;s future operating results. See the preceding discussion of &#8220;Asbestos Claims and Litigation&#8221; and &#8220;Environmental Claims and Litigation.&#8221; \n\nGeneral Discussion \n\nThe process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. \n\nMultiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. \n\nIn most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves by reporting segments are reasonable, given available information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of management&#8217;s recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate. \n\nThe exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. \n\nProperty-casualty insurance policies are either written on a &#8220;claims-made&#8221; or on an &#8220;occurrence&#8221; basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. \n\nMost general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of loss trends, which can be influenced by a number of factors, including future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others. \n\nA basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is estimated to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. In addition, the introduction of new products creates a unique risk as historical company data would typically not be available. \n\nInformed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult. \n\nThe variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. \n\nProduct lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time to final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. \n\nA major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years&#8217; worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses for such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. \n\nFor some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being &#8220;low frequency/high severity,&#8221; while lines without this &#8220;large claim&#8221; sensitivity are referred to as &#8220;high frequency/low severity.&#8221; Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable. \n\nClaim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. \n\nActuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. \n\nLastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization. \n\nRisk Factors \n\nThe major causes of material uncertainty (&#8220;risk factors&#8221;) generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently. \n\n&#160; \n\nSome risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples, some of which have been exacerbated by COVID-19, include changes in claim department practices, changes in the tort environment, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, medical utilization and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. \n\nThe effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. \n\nThe evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region may be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. \n\nSudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. \n\nActuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves \n\nThe principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company&#8217;s actuaries to evaluate management&#8217;s existing estimates for prior accident periods are the paid loss development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method. The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. These estimation and analysis methods are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (See note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these methods). \n\nWhile the Company utilizes these conventional actuarial methods to estimate the claims liability for its various businesses, Company actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line may select from the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The Company&#8217;s actuaries are also regularly monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates. \n\nSome components of a product line may be susceptible to infrequent large claims or not be subject to conventional methods. In such cases, the Company&#8217;s actuarial analysis will isolate such components for review. The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as: \n\n&#8226; Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available. \n\n&#8226; Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates). \n\n&#8226; Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis. \n\n&#8226; Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental). \n\nThe results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios, non-zero claim severity trends and paid-to-incurred loss ratios. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management&#8217;s estimate. Additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods. \n\nThe methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management&#8217;s estimate for prior accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, however, the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. As a result, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the loss ratio projection method or the expected loss method. The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate for an accident year by multiplying earned premiums for the accident year by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period experience, and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the stability and consistency of the individual accident year estimates. The expected loss method, which is typically used for \n\nloss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Estimates \n\nAt least once per quarter, certain members of Company management meet with the Company&#8217;s actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed from the prior period. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. \n\n&#160; \n\nSuch an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform as the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company&#8217;s estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves for the purpose of the Company&#8217;s financial statements. \n\nDiscussion of Product Lines \n\nThe following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers&#8217; compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. \n\nIn order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year period are provided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), as required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available. \n\nGeneral Liability \n\nGeneral liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the characteristics of claims, including specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions, among others. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for &#8220;construction defect&#8221; claims). \n\nWhile the majority of general liability coverages are written on an &#8220;occurrence&#8221; basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering management and professional liability, including cyber coverages) are typically insured on a &#8220;claims-made&#8221; basis. \n\nGeneral liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder&#8217;s legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant&#8217;s private property arising from the policyholder&#8217;s legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. \n\nIn addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods. \n\nDefense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. Such &#8220;defense within the limits&#8221; policies are most common for &#8220;claims-made&#8221; products. When defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no contractual limit. \n\nThis line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the &#8220;event&#8221; triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater estimation uncertainty. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure). \n\nThe amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, components with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than components without those characteristics. \n\nIn addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development methods for the construction defect components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the Company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred development methods. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nGeneral liability risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in claim handling philosophies \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions \n\n&#8226; New or expanded theories of liability \n\n&#8226; Trends in jury awards \n\n&#8226; Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues \n\n&#8226; Changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim \n\n&#8226; Increases in attorney involvement in, or impact on, claims \n\n&#8226; Changes in statutes of limitations \n\n&#8226; Changes in the underlying court system \n\n&#8226; Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues \n\n&#8226; Changes in tort law \n\n&#8226; Shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts \n\n&#8226; Changes in claim adjuster processes or reporting which may cause distortions in the data being analyzed \n\n&#8226; The potential impact of inflation on loss costs \n\n&#8226; Changes in settlement patterns \n\nGeneral liability book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\n&#8226; Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.6% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from -5% to 6% (averaging -1%) for the Company, and from -3% to 3% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 22% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line related to the last nine accident years, which excludes the impacts of increases in asbestos and environmental reserves, the extension of the statute of limitations for childhood sexual molestation claims and increases in reserves in the Company's runoff operations, was 1% for 2021, 3% for 2020 and 6% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance for accident years 2012 and 2017 through 2019 and in Business Insurance for accident years 2018 through 2020. The 2020 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in Business Insurance for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2015 through 2019 and in Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance for accident years 2015, 2018 and 2019. The 2019 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in Business Insurance for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2013 through 2018, partially offset by better than expected loss experience for management liability coverages in Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance for accident years 2013 through 2015. \n\nCommercial Property \n\nCommercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. \n\nCommercial property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nCommercial property risk factors \n\n&#8226; Physical concentration of policyholders \n\n&#8226; Availability and cost of local contractors \n\n&#8226; For the more severe catastrophic events, &#8220;demand surge&#8221; inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services \n\n&#8226; Local building codes \n\n&#8226; Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) \n\n&#8226; Frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed \n\n&#8226; Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, wind versus flooding or communicable disease exclusions) \n\n&#8226; Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) \n\n&#8226; Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations \n\nCommercial property book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -21% to -6% (averaging -12%) for the Company, and from -10% to -5% (averaging -6%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nSince commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because weather-related events that occur in the second half of the year may not be completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms and wildfires. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -10% for 2021, -11% for 2020 and -6% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident year 2020. The 2020 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident year 2019 and the PG&#38;E subrogation recovery for accident years 2017 and 2018. The 2019 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2016 through 2018. \n\nCommercial Multi-Peril \n\nCommercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. \n\nThe reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or other large single loss events. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to small- to mid-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers. \n\nSee &#8220;Commercial property risk factors&#8221; and &#8220;General liability risk factors,&#8221; discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril. \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from -5% to 4% (averaging 1%) for the Company, and from -3% to 1% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the \n\nyear. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 8% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nAs discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line related to the last nine accident years, which excludes the impacts of increases in asbestos and environmental reserves and increases in reserves in the Company's runoff operations, was 0% for 2021, 0% for 2020 and 4% for 2019. In 2021, higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2017 and 2018 was largely offset by better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2012 through 2016. In 2020, higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident year 2019 was largely offset by the PG&#38;E subrogation recovery for accident years 2017 and 2018. The 2019 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2017 and 2018. \n\nCommercial Automobile \n\nThe commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are generally short, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. Recently, the Company has seen more of an increase in the rate of attorney involvement than it had anticipated and a lengthening of the claim development pattern. As a consequence, the Company has experienced a higher level of bodily injury severity than it had anticipated. \n\nCommercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. \n\nThe Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors \n\n&#8226; Trends in jury awards \n\n&#8226; Changes in the underlying court system \n\n&#8226; Changes in case law \n\n&#8226; Litigation trends \n\n&#8226; Increases in attorney involvement in, or impact on, claims \n\n&#8226; Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits \n\n&#8226; Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents, including the impact of inflation \n\n&#8226; Changes in auto safety technology \n\n&#8226; Subrogation opportunities \n\n&#8226; Changes in claim handling philosophies \n\n&#8226; Frequency of visits to health providers \n\n&#8226; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers \n\n&#8226; Types of health providers used \n\n&#8226; Types of medical treatments received \n\n&#8226; Changes in cost of medical treatments \n\n&#8226; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n\nCommercial automobile book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) \n\n&#8226; Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets) \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -2% to 11% (averaging 2%) for the Company, and from 2% to 7% (averaging 5%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 9% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -2% for 2021, 4% for 2020 and 7% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability and physical damage coverage for accident year 2020. The 2020 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident year 2019. The 2019 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2015 through 2018. \n\nWorkers&#8217; Compensation \n\nWorkers&#8217; compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker&#8217;s life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, payment obligations are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker&#8217;s injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. \n\nWorkers&#8217; compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers&#8217; compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nIndemnity risk factors \n\n&#8226; Time required to recover from the injury \n\n&#8226; Degree of available transitional jobs \n\n&#8226; Degree of legal involvement \n\n&#8226; Changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers&#8217; compensation claims \n\n&#8226; Future wage inflation for states that index benefits \n\n&#8226; Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds \n\n&#160; Medical risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (&#8220;inflation&#8221;) \n\n&#8226; Availability of medical providers and medical wage impacts \n\n&#8226; Frequency of visits to health providers \n\n&#8226; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers \n\n&#8226; Types of health providers used \n\n&#8226; Type of medical treatments received \n\n&#8226; Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices \n\n&#8226; Availability of new medical processes and equipment \n\n&#8226; Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs, including drugs for pain management \n\n&#8226; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n\nGeneral workers&#8217; compensation risk factors \n\n&#8226; Frequency of reopening claims previously closed \n\n&#8226; Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment \n\n&#8226; Changes in statutory benefits, including due to presumption laws \n\n&#8226; The impact, if any, of potential future changes to government health insurance legislation \n\nWorkers&#8217; compensation book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Product mix \n\n&#8226; Injury type mix \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers&#8217; compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -4% to 0% (averaging -2%) for the Company, and from -5% to -1% (averaging -3%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Workers&#8217; compensation reserves represent approximately 35% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -3% for 2021, -3% for 2020 and -4% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2020 and prior. The 2020 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2018 and prior. The 2019 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2018 and prior. \n\nFidelity and Surety \n\nFidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured&#8217;s business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims. \n\nSurety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being bonded. The frequency of losses in surety generally has a lagging correlation with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction projects. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the bonded party, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the surety company to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of a bonded party's assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by the bonded party and due to the surety company (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts), the results of financial restructuring of a bonded party and the availability and cost of replacement contractors, labor and materials. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\n&#160; \n\nFidelity risk factors \n\n&#8226; Type of business of insured \n\n&#8226; Policy limit and attachment points \n\n&#8226; Third-party claims \n\n&#8226; Coverage litigation \n\n&#8226; Complexity of claims \n\n&#8226; Growth in insureds&#8217; operations \n\n&#160; \n\nSurety risk factors \n\n&#8226; Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity \n\n&#8226; Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims \n\n&#8226; Type of business bonded \n\n&#8226; Type of obligation bonded \n\n&#8226; Cumulative limits of liability for the bonded party \n\n&#8226; Assets available to mitigate loss \n\n&#8226; Defective workmanship/latent defects \n\n&#8226; Financial strategy of the bonded party \n\n&#8226; Changes in statutory obligations \n\n&#8226; Geographic spread of business \n\nFidelity and Surety book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements) \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -36% to -10% (averaging -21%) for the Company, and from -17% to 0% (averaging -11%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 1% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nIn general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -27% for 2021, -12% for 2020 and -11% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2015 through 2017 and 2020. The 2020 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2015, 2018 and 2019. The 2019 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident year 2017. \n\nPersonal Automobile \n\nPersonal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nPersonal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury, property damage liability and no-fault risk factors \n\n&#8226; Trends in jury awards \n\n&#8226; Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy \n\n&#8226; Changes in case law \n\n&#8226; Litigation trends \n\n&#8226; Increases in attorney involvement in, or impact on, claims \n\n&#8226; Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits \n\n&#8226; Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents, including the impact of inflation \n\n&#8226; Changes in auto technology, including safety features \n\n&#8226; Frequency and severity of claims involving distracted drivers and pedestrians \n\n&#8226; Subrogation opportunities \n\n&#8226; Frequency of visits to health providers \n\n&#8226; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers \n\n&#8226; Types of health providers used \n\n&#8226; Types of medical treatments received \n\n&#8226; Changes in cost of medical treatments \n\n&#8226; Effectiveness of no-fault laws \n\n&#8226; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n\n&#8226; Changes in claim handling philosophies \n\nPersonal automobile book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\n&#8226; Changes in the use of permissible data for rating and underwriting \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -4% to 3% (averaging -1%) for the Company, and from -3% to 2% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Personal automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -4% for 2021, -2% for 2020 and -2% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability and physical damage coverages for accident years 2017 through 2020. The 2020 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability and physical damage coverages for accident years 2016 through 2018. The 2019 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability coverages in accident years 2016 through 2018. \n\nPersonal Homeowners and Other \n\nHomeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. \n\nThe liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. Personal Insurance Other products include personal umbrella policies, among others. See &#8220;general liability reserving risk factors,&#8221; discussed above, for reserving risk factors related to umbrella coverages. \n\nOverall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. \n\nHomeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe losses. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nNon-catastrophe risk factors \n\n&#8226; Salvage opportunities \n\n&#8226; Amount of time to return property to residential use \n\n&#8226; Changes in weather patterns \n\n&#8226; Local building codes \n\n&#8226; Construction and building labor and material costs \n\n&#8226; Litigation trends \n\n&#8226; Trends in jury awards \n\n&#8226; Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) \n\n&#8226; Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) \n\n&#8226; Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations \n\nAdditional risk factors for catastrophes \n\n&#8226; Physical concentration of policyholders \n\n&#8226; Availability and cost of local contractors \n\n&#8226; Local building codes \n\n&#8226; Quality of construction of damaged homes \n\n&#8226; Amount of time to return property to residential use \n\n&#8226; For the more severe catastrophic events, &#8220;demand surge&#8221; inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services \n\nHomeowners book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) \n\n&#8226; Degree of concentration of policyholders \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\n&#8226; Changes in the use of permissible data for rating and underwriting \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal homeowners and other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding Personal Insurance Other, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with other lines of business) over the last nine years has varied from -28% to 3% (averaging -10%) for the Company, and from -7% to 1% (averaging -3%) for the industry overall. The Company&#8217;s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Personal homeowners and other reserves represent approximately 4% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThis line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because weather-related events in the second half of the year may not be completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes, including California wildfires in recent years, may take even longer to resolve. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding Personal Insurance Other) was -9% for 2021, -28% for 2020 and -5% for 2019. The 2021 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2016 through 2018 and 2020. The 2020 change primarily reflected the PG&#38;E subrogation recovery for accident years 2017 and 2018, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience for catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident year 2019. The 2019 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2015, 2016 and 2018. \n\nInternational and Other \n\nInternational and other includes products written by the Company&#8217;s international operations, as well as all other products not explicitly discussed above. The principal component of &#8220;other&#8221; claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff business. \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. \n\nDue to changes in the business mix for this product line over time, incurred claim liabilities for more recent years are generally shorter-tailed (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), compared to the older liabilities from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes. \n\nInternational reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability in Canada, Commercial Property in the United Kingdom, etc.). The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the Homeowners, Personal Automobile, Commercial Automobile, General Liability, Commercial Property and Surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. However, statutory coverage differences exist amongst various jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages. \n\nOther reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability &#8212; excess of loss reinsurance). Excess exposure requires the insured to &#8220;prove&#8221; not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy&#8217;s attachment point. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section, and in the Personal Automobile, Homeowners, General Liability, Commercial Property, Commercial Automobile and Surety discussions above) include: \n\nInternational and other risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision \n\n&#8226; Economic trends \n\n&#8226; New theories of liability \n\n&#8226; Trends in jury awards \n\n&#8226; Changes in the propensity to sue \n\n&#8226; Changes in statutes of limitations \n\n&#8226; Changes in the underlying court system \n\n&#8226; Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues \n\n&#8226; Changes in tort law \n\n&#8226; Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) \n\n&#8226; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates \n\nInternational and other book of business risk factors \n\n&#8226; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, &#8220;claims-made&#8221; language) \n\n&#8226; Changes in underwriting standards \n\n&#8226; Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 8% of the Company&#8217;s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nInternational and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the United States do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year \n\nchanges in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other. \n\nReinsurance Recoverables \n\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company&#8217;s rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. \n\nThe Company has entered into a reinsurance contract in connection with catastrophe bonds issued by Long Point Re III. This contract meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The catastrophe bonds are described in more detail in &#8220;Item 1-Business-Catastrophe Reinsurance.&#8221; \n\nRecoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers&#8217; compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers&#8217; compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies&#8217; obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company&#8217;s voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool&#8217;s or association&#8217;s obligations, the other members&#8217; share of such obligation increases proportionally. \n\nThe Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance is based upon the Company&#8217;s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. For structured settlements, the allowance is also based upon the Company&#8217;s ongoing review of life insurers&#8217; creditworthiness and estimated amounts of coverage that would be available from state guaranty funds if a life insurer defaults. A probability-of-default methodology which reflects current and forecasted economic conditions is used to estimate the amount of uncollectible reinsurance due to credit-related factors and the estimate is reported in an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance also includes estimated uncollectible amounts related to dispute risk with reinsurers. Amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance. Changes in the allowance, as well as any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off, are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. \n\nImpairments \n\nInvestment Impairments \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of investment impairments. \n\nDue to the subjective nature of the Company&#8217;s analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairments \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nOTHER UNCERTAINTIES \n\nFor a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial position, see note 17 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report contains, and management may make, certain &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
