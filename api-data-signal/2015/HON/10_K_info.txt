All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nIn 2015, Honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic climate by combining strategic growth in our diverse portfolio and our well-known cost discipline with a marked acceleration of our capital deployment strategy. Earnings per share of common stock&#150;assuming dilution, grew 13% to $6.04 per share in 2015 and net income attributable to Honeywell grew 12% to $4,768 million. Our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value resulted in segment margin expansion of 220 basis points versus 2014 without sacrificing seed planting intended to ensure future growth, including maintaining R&#38;D spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety and security and productivity, $216 million of repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth Regions. Honeywell Operating System (HOS) Gold and Honeywell User Experience (HUE) initiatives intensified throughout the company, driving productivity through sustainable improvements to our factories, footprints and supply chain. \n\nIn 2015 we deployed capital of over $10 billion, including the following: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Mergers and Acquisitions&#151; we deployed over $5 billion during 2015, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our three operating segments. These acquisitions all share a technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Dividend &#151;after a 15% dividend rate increase in 2014, we again increased our annual dividend rate by 15% in 2015, as we seek to grow the dividend faster than earnings. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Share Repurchases &#151;we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans. In 2015, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.9 billion. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Capital Investment in Facilities &#151;we invested over $1 billion in high return capital expenditures, focused on revenue growth projects such as our Solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products for the automotive industry and catalyst products in UOP. \n\n##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nNet Sales \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2015 \n\n&#160; 2014 \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n38,581 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n40,306 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n39,055 \n\n&#160; % change compared with prior period \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nThe change in net sales is attributable to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2015 Versus 2014 \n\n&#160; 2014 Versus 2013 \n\nVolume \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3% \n\n&#160; Price \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1)% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; Acquisitions/Divestitures \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1)% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1% \n\n&#160; Foreign Currency Translation \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (4)% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; Other \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1)% \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (4)% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3% \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MD&#38;A.

The effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension mark-to-market adjustments. \n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $175 million to $200 million in 2016 compared with 2015 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $118 million, $161 million and $160 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2016, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $175 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Years Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; 2015 \n\n&#160; 2014 \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\nCash provided by (used for): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,454 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,024 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4,335 \n\n&#160; Investing activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (6,514 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1,876 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1,959 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancing activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 102 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (2,272 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (433 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (546 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (339 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (155 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,504 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,788 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 2015 compared with 2014 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $430 million primarily due to a $489 million favorable impact from working capital and a $382 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by (i) a $175 million decrease in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) $151 million in OEM incentives and (iii) increased cash tax payments of $50 million. \n\nCash used for investing activities increased by $4,638 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $5,224 million, most significantly the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), and a decrease in proceeds of $159 million, primarily from the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by a net $659 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities. \n\nCash provided by financing activities increased by $2,374 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $3,648 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,039 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $216 million. \n\n2014 compared with 2013 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $689 million primarily due to (i) a $508 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (ii) reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of $233 million primarily due to the collection of a $130 million asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of $98 million, (iii) reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $131 million and (iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $129 million, partially offset by a $93 million unfavorable impact from working capital primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth. \n\nCash used for investing activities decreased by $83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1,129 million most significantly Intermec and RAE Systems, Inc. in 2013 and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $157 million (most significantly Friction Materials), partially offset by (i) a net $688 million increase in investments primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of approximately $371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency \n\n&#160;\n\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a $147 million increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment. \n\nCash used for financing activities increased by $1,839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,589 million, an increase in cash dividends paid of $157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $33 million. \n\nLiquidity \n\nEach of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2015, a substantial portion of the Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. \n\nA source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.26% and 0.60%. \n\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2015, Standard and Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P), Fitch, and Moody&#146;s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S&#38;P, Fitch and Moody&#146;s have Honeywell&#146;s rating outlook as &#147;stable.&#148; To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n\nDuring 2015, the Company entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. See Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the credit agreements. \n\nDuring 2015, the Company repurchased $1,884 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $2.2 billion remained available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. \n\nSpecifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2016 to be as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures&#151;we expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2016 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Share repurchases&#151;under the Company&#146;s share repurchase program, $2.2 billion is available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Dividends&#151;we increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5950 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2015 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2016. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Asbestos claims&#151;we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $295 million and $25 million in 2016. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Pension contributions&#151;in 2016, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $160 million ($106 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2016) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Repositioning actions&#151;we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2016. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Environmental remediation costs&#151;we expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2016 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Acquisitions&#151;we acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC for approximately $240 million in January 2016. In addition, in February 2016 we acquired COM DEV International for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $330 million and entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xtralis International Holdings Limited for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $480 million. \n\n##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2015 and 2014, we realized $1 million and $160 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. \n\n&#160;\n\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2015: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Total(6) \n\n&#160; Payments by Period \n\n&#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; 2016 \n\n&#160; 2017- 2018 \n\n&#160; 2019- 2020 \n\nLong-term debt, including capitalized leases(1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,131 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,400 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,250 \n\n&#160; Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3,047 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 290 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 494 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 344 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,919 \n\n&#160; Minimum operating lease payments \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,201 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 316 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 421 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 191 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 273 \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations(2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,980 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 962 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 623 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 392 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3 \n\n&#160; Estimated environmental liability payments(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 518 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 253 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 190 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 55 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 20 \n\n&#160; Asbestos related liability payments(4) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,543 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 292 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 775 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 382 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 94 \n\n&#160; Asbestos insurance recoveries(5) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (449 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (23 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (110 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (103 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (213 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n13,971 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,667 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,793 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,165 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,346 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; (1) \n\n&#160; Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n&#160; (2) \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n&#160; (3) \n\n&#160; The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015. \n\n&#160; (4) \n\n&#160; These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015.

In addition, in 2015 and 2014 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $90 million and $88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nSpending related to known environmental matters was $273 million, $321 million and $304 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and is estimated to be approximately $250 million in 2016. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments \n\n&#160;\n\nbased on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2015 and 2014. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Face or Notional Amount \n\n&#160; Carrying Value(1) \n\n&#160; Fair Value(1) \n\n&#160; Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value(2) \n\nDecember 31, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,131 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,131 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,721 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(407 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,100 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 92 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 92 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (59 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 10,538 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 11 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 11 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (153 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,985 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,985 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,817 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(478 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,100 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 93 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 93 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (69 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7,291 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 10 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 10 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 86 \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; (1) \n\n&#160; Asset or (liability). \n\n&#160; (2) \n\n&#160; A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. \n\n&#160; (3) \n\n&#160; Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#151;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of \n\n&#160;\n\nmanagement&#146;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. \n\nAsbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries &#151;Honeywell&#146;s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#151;We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense). \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our 2015, 2014 and 2013 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2015 \n\n&#160; 2014 \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\nDiscount rate \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.08 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.89 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.06 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 23 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the \n\n&#160;\n\nvarious assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $67 million, $249 million and $51 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. \n\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2016 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan&#146;s investments. \n\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.46% discount rate as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in Assumption \n\n&#160; Impact on 2016 Pension Ongoing Expense \n\n&#160; Impact on PBO \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate \n\n&#160; Decrease $19 million \n\n&#160; Increase $490 million \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate \n\n&#160; Increase $17 million \n\n&#160; Decrease $470 million \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Increase $40 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Decrease $40 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $580 million in 2016 compared with pension ongoing income of $430 million in 2015. The expected increase is primarily due to lower service and interest costs resulting mainly from the change in our discount rate methodology as described in Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements and the plan amendment in the fourth quarter of 2015 to freeze final average compensation in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2015 partially offset by the impact of lower asset returns in 2015. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2016, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nLong-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) &#151;The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant negative industry or economic trends; or \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing &#151;In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. \n\nIncome Taxes &#151;On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#151;In 2015, we recognized approximately 14% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\n&#160;\n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 102, "Negative": 169, "Polarity": -0.2472324714124263, "Subjectivity": 0.059560439547349346}, "similarity_score": 0.9980872541641268, "nlp_result": 0}
