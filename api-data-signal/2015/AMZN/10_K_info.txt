All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management&#8217;s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management&#8217;s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nOverview \n\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards. \n\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 &#32;per share. &#32;Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 &#32;and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders&#8217; interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million &#32;and 483 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . \n\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. &#32;Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. \n\n_______________________ \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nSee &#8220;Results of Operations&#8212;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nWorking capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. \n\n##TABLE_END 18 \n\nBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . &#32;On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover 4 &#32;was 8 &#32;for 2015 &#32;and 9 &#32;for 2014 &#32;and 2013 . We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days 5 &#32;were 77 , 73, and 74 for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. \n\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. &#32;We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people&#8217;s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. \n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. \n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. \n\nFor additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies.&#8221; \n\nCritical Accounting Judgments \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company&#8217;s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies.&#8221; Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\n_______________________ \n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nThe operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) \n\nInventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) \n\nAccounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. \n\n##TABLE_END 19 \n\nInventories \n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $115 million. \n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \n\nGoodwill \n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the second quarter of 2015, we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from October 1 to April 1. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. \n\nDuring the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of April 1, 2015, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. \n\nFinancial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted-average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2015 &#32;closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $46 million impact on our 2015 &#32;operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , were 28% and 27%. \n\nWe utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard. \n\nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies&#8212;Recent Accounting Pronouncements.&#8221; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by (used in): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n$ \n\n11,920 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,842 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,475 \n\nInvesting activities \n\n(6,450 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,065 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,276 \n\n) \n\nFinancing activities \n\n(3,763 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n4,432 \n\n&#160; \n\n(539 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $19.8 billion , $17.4 billion , and $12.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $7.3 billion , $5.4 billion, and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. \n\nCash provided by operating activities was $11.9 billion , $6.8 billion , and $5.5 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase &#32;in operating cash flow in 2015 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash charges to net income (loss) such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital. The increase &#32;in operating cash flow in 2014 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in non-cash charges to net income (loss), including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in working capital. \n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(6.5) billion , $(5.1) billion , and $(4.3) billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $4.6 billion , $ 4.9 billion , and $ 3.4 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . This primarily reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations, during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $528 million, $537 million, and $493 million for internal-use software and website development in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $795 million , $979 million , and $312 million . \n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.8) billion , $4.4 billion , and $(539) million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $4.2 billion , $1.9 billion , and $1.0 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . The increase in 2015 primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a $750 million repayment on our unsecured senior notes. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.7 billion , $4.0 billion , and $1.9 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , with the increases &#32;reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We expect this trend toward additional investment to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $353 million , $6.4 billion , and $394 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . During 2014, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Long-Term Debt&#8221; for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $119 million , $6 million , and $78 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . \n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.0 billion Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2015 . See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Long-Term Debt&#8221; for additional information. \n\nIn 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we recorded net tax provisions of $950 million , $167 million , and $161 million . Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015 , cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $5.8 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $1.5 billion . We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $273 million , $177 million , and $169 million &#32;for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . As of December 31, 2015 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.1 billion &#32;and we had approximately $622 million &#32;of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. \n\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents&#8221; to restricted cash, which is classified within &#8220;Accounts receivable, net and other&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $285 million &#32;and $450 million . See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 . Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. \n\nOn average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 8 &#32;for 2015 &#32;and 9 &#32;for 2014 &#32;and 2013 . We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. \n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. \n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part 1,&#8220;Financial Statements&#8212;Note 11&#8212;Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, digital content subscriptions, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(5.2) billion , $(636) million , and $(1.3) billion &#32;for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see &#8220;Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates&#8221; below. \n\nNorth America sales increased &#32; 25% , 23% , and 26% &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. \n\nInternational sales increased &#32; 6% , 12% , and 14% &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(5.0) billion , $(580) million , and $(1.3) billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such \n\nas electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. \n\nAWS sales increased 70 %, 49 %, and 69 % in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. \n\nSegment Operating Income (Loss) \n\nSegment operating income (loss) is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Operating Income (Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n$ \n\n2,751 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,166 \n\nInternational \n\n(91 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(144 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nAWS \n\n1,863 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in North America segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure. There was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $30 million, $0, and $7 million for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . \n\nThe decrease in International segment operating loss in absolute dollars in 2015 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity, spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates was $278 million, $27 million, and $70 million for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . The decrease in International segment operating income (loss) in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. \n\nThe increase in AWS segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2015 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. The decrease in AWS segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by increased usage. There was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $264 million, $41 million, and $38 million for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . \n\nSupplemental Information \n\nSupplemental information about outbound shipping results for our North America and International segments is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutbound Shipping Activity: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShipping revenue (1)(2)(3) \n\n$ \n\n6,520 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,486 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,097 \n\nShipping costs (4) \n\n(11,539 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,709 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,635 \n\n) \n\nNet shipping cost \n\n$ \n\n(5,019 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,223 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(3,538 \n\n) \n\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShipping revenue \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nShipping costs \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet shipping cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent of Net Sales (5): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShipping revenue \n\n6.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\nShipping costs \n\n(11.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10.3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9.3 \n\n) \n\nNet shipping cost \n\n(5.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.0 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nExcludes amounts charged on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nIncludes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nIncludes amounts earned from Fulfillment by Amazon programs related to shipping services. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) \n\nIncludes sortation and delivery center costs. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) \n\nIncludes North America and International segment net sales. \n\n##TABLE_END We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services.

See &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; and Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies&#8212;Stock-Based Compensation.&#8221; \n\nIn 2014, we recorded charges estimated at $170 million primarily related to Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs, the majority of which was included in the North America segment. \n\nCost of Sales \n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including Prime Video and Prime Music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. \n\nThe increase &#32;in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. The increase in 2014 was also impacted by the expansion of digital offerings and Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs. \n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as &#8220;Technology and content&#8221; as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. \n\nFulfillment \n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as &#8220;Technology and content.&#8221; Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction \n\nand fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. \n\nThe increase &#32;in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs. \n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. \n\nMarketing \n\nWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, direct sales, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. \n\nThe increase &#32;in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses. \n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. \n\nTechnology and Content \n\nTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses. Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection. Digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross, including Prime Video, are included in cost of sales. \n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment, and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services. \n\nTechnology infrastructure costs consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS service offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage. \n\nThe increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of products and services. \n\nFor 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we capitalized $642 million &#32;(including $114 million &#32;of stock-based compensation), $641 million &#32;(including $104 million &#32;of stock-based compensation), and $581 million &#32;(including $87 million &#32;of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million , $559 million , and $451 million &#32;for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\nThe increase &#32;in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2015 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. The increase &#32;in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nStock-based compensation was $2.1 billion , $1.5 billion , and $1.1 billion &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . The increase &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted to existing and new employees. \n\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net \n\nOther operating expense (income), net was $171 million , $133 million , and $114 million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. \n\nIncome from Operations \n\nFor the reasons discussed above, income from operations increased &#32;to $2.2 billion &#32;in 2015 , from $178 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $745 million &#32;in 2013 . \n\nWe believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. \n\nInterest Income and Expense \n\nOur interest income was $50 million , $39 million , and $38 million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. \n\nInterest expense was $459 million , $210 million , and $141 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . The increase &#32;is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt, and capital and finance lease arrangements. \n\nOur long-term debt was $8.2 billion &#32;and $8.3 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . Our other long-term liabilities were $9.9 billion &#32;and $7.4 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Long-Term Debt and Note 6&#8212;Other Long-Term Liabilities&#8221; for additional information. \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\nOther income (expense), net was $(256) million , $(118) million , and $(136) million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign-currency gains (losses). \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. \n\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $950 million , $167 million , and $161 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg. \n\nOur provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments, partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit were primarily generated by our foreign subsidiaries. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions was primarily related to our European operations. \n\nWe have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the U.S. federal research and development credit. As of December 31, 2015 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.1 billion &#32;and we had \n\napproximately $622 million &#32;of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015. \n\nSee Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 10&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; for additional information. \n\nEquity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax \n\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(22) million , $37 million , and $(71) million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , and is primarily related to our investment in LivingSocial. The primary component of this activity during 2014 &#32;was our share of a gain recorded by LivingSocial related to the sale of its Korean operations. This gain was partially offset by operating losses incurred by LivingSocial during the period. \n\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates \n\nThe effect on our income from operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nAt Prior \n\nYear \n\nRates (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nExchange \n\nRate \n\nEffect (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nAs \n\nReported \n\n&#160; \n\nAt Prior \n\nYear \n\nRates (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nExchange \n\nRate \n\nEffect (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nAs \n\nReported \n\n&#160; \n\nAt Prior \n\nYear \n\nRates (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nExchange \n\nRate \n\nEffect (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nAs \n\nReported \n\nNet sales \n\n$ \n\n112,173 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(5,167 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n107,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n89,624 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(636 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n88,988 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n75,736 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,284 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n74,452 \n\nOperating expenses \n\n109,956 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,183 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n104,773 \n\n&#160; \n\n89,466 \n\n&#160; \n\n(656 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n88,810 \n\n&#160; \n\n74,962 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,255 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n73,707 \n\nIncome from operations \n\n2,217 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(29 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n___ ________________ \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nRepresents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nRepresents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. \n\n##TABLE_END Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows, operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by &#8220;Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net&#8221; which is included in cash flow from investing activities.

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nOperating Expenses, Excluding Stock-Based Compensation \n\nOperating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment \n\nresults, and therefore, excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nOperating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the &#8220;Fulfillment,&#8221; &#8220;Marketing,&#8221; &#8220;Technology and content,&#8221; and &#8220;General and administrative&#8221; line items would be higher. \n\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates \n\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. \n\nGuidance \n\nWe provided guidance on January 28, 2016 , in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com&#8217;s expectations as of January 28, 2016 , and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nFirst Quarter 2016 &#32;Guidance \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNet sales are expected to be between $26.5 billion and $29.0 billion, or to grow between 17% and 28% compared with first quarter 2015. &#32; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperating income is expected to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. &#32; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThis guidance includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense (income), net.
