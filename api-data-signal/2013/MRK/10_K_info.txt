(&#8220;Merck&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health, and consumer care products, which it markets directly and through its joint ventures. The Company&#8217;s operations are principally managed on a products basis and are comprised of four operating segments, which are the Pharmaceutical, Animal Health, Consumer Care and Alliances segments, and one reportable segment, which is the Pharmaceutical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products marketed either directly by the Company or through joint ventures. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, primarily administered at physician offices. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company also has animal health operations that discover, develop, manufacture and market animal health products, including vaccines, which the Company sells to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers. Additionally, the Company has consumer care operations that develop, manufacture and market over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products, which are sold through wholesale and retail drug, food chain and mass merchandiser outlets, as well as club stores and specialty channels. \n\nOverview \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenue performance in 2013 was tempered by ongoing business challenges, including recent product patent expiries and ongoing global efforts toward health care cost containment that continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Worldwide sales were $44.0 billion &#32;in 2013, a decline of 7% compared with 2012, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The decline was driven primarily by the recent loss of market exclusivity for several products, particularly Singulair , a medicine indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, as well as Maxalt , a product for acute treatment of migraine, Propecia , a product for the treatment of male pattern hair loss, and Temodar , a treatment for certain types of brain tumors. The Company experienced a significant and rapid decline in sales of these products following loss of market exclusivity. These declines were partially offset by higher sales of vaccines, immunology, diabetes and HIV products. \n\nThe Company continued to successfully execute on its cost reduction initiatives in 2013. Marketing and administrative &#32;expenses and Research and development &#32;costs were down over $1.5 billion on a combined basis in 2013 as compared with 2012 reflecting targeted reductions in promotional spending and lower costs as a result of portfolio prioritization. \n\nIn an effort to drive further company-wide efficiencies, Merck is taking several strategic and operating actions in response to its business challenges and the rapidly changing external environment it is facing that are designed to drive short- and long-term growth. In October 2013, the Company announced a multi-year global initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus designed to enable Merck to better allocate its resources on candidates that it believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers. This includes bolstering its pipeline and implementing a more agile operating model, with a significantly reduced, more flexible cost structure while still maintaining a high level of cash returned to shareholders. \n\nGeographically, the Company will increase its focus on ten prioritized markets, which account for the majority of revenue in its pharmaceutical and vaccine business. These markets are the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, China, Brazil, Russia and Korea. The Company will continue to invest in high-growth and key emerging markets. \n\nWithin the core human pharmaceutical and vaccine business, Merck will continue to support its in-line portfolio and prepare for promising launches in the pipeline. The Company will increase its focus on the key therapeutic areas that meet unmet medical needs, provide the best opportunities for the business and deliver the greatest value for customers &#8211; diabetes, acute hospital care, vaccines and oncology. As part of its intensified portfolio assessment process, the Company has divested a portion of its U.S. ophthalmics business and sold the U.S. marketing rights for Saphris, \n\nan antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in adults. The Company&#8217;s portfolio assessment process is ongoing and future product divestitures may occur. \n\nIn addition, in January 2014, the Company announced that it was evaluating the respective roles of Merck&#8217;s Animal Health and Consumer Care businesses in the Company&#8217;s strategy for long-term value creation. The Company expects to complete the evaluation process and take action, if any, in 2014. The Company could reach different decisions about the two businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s re-focused research and development efforts include programs such as the Company&#8217;s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (MK-3475) in oncology, which has received a Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) for advanced melanoma, Merck&#8217;s BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (MK-8931), the Company&#8217;s all oral combination regimen for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (MK-5172/MK-8742), and V503, a nine-valent human papillomavirus (&#8220;HPV&#8221;) vaccine. In January 2014, the Company announced it has initiated the rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) to the FDA for MK-3475 in patients with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with ipilimumab. During 2013, the Company received a Breakthrough Therapy designation for MK-5172/MK-8742 and has advanced the combination into Phase 2B in a diverse range of chronic hepatitis C patients. The Company has initiated Phase 3 trials for its BACE inhibitor (MK-8931) and filed a BLA with the FDA for V503. \n\nMerck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality and is building its biologics capabilities. The Company expects to make externally sourced programs a greater component of its pipeline strategy. During 2013, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of ertugliflozin, an investigational oral sodium glucose cotransporter (&#8220;SGLT2&#8221;) inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Phase 3 clinical development. \n\nThe Company is out-licensing or discontinuing selected late-stage clinical development assets and reducing its focus on platform technologies. During 2013, the Company out-licensed MK-1775, an investigational treatment for certain types of ovarian cancer, and in January 2014 entered into an agreement to divest its Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. subsidiary and related RNAi technology assets. \n\nThe Company currently has several candidates under review with the FDA: MK-5348, vorapaxar, an investigational anti-thrombotic medicine (also under review in the European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;)); V503, a nine-valent HPV vaccine; MK-8962, corifollitropin alfa injection, an investigational fertility treatment; MK-7243, Grastek , an investigational Timothy grass pollen &#32; allergy immunotherapy tablet (&#8220;AIT&#8221;) and MK-3641, Ragwitek , an investigational ragweed pollen AIT. Also, MK-8109, vintafolide, an investigational cancer candidate, is under review in the EU and MK-7009, vaniprevir, an investigational, oral twice-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection is under review in Japan. In February 2014, the Company resubmitted its New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) to the FDA for MK-4305, suvorexant, responding to the agency&#8217;s Complete Response Letter (&#8220;CRL&#8221;) received in 2013. In addition, the Company anticipates resubmitting its NDA application in 2014 to the FDA for MK-8616, sugammadex sodium injection, a medication for the reversal of certain muscle relaxants used during surgery for which the Company received a CRL in 2013 (see &#8220;Research and Development&#8221; below). The Company also has 12 candidates in Phase 3 development and anticipates filing a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or a BLA, as applicable, with the FDA with respect to several of these candidates in 2014, including the completion of the rolling submission of the BLA for MK-3475 for patients with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with ipilimumab. \n\nIn October 2013, in connection with the implementation of Company&#8217;s new global initiative, the Company announced a global restructuring program (the &#8220;2013 Restructuring Program&#8221;). As part of the program, the Company expects to reduce its total workforce by approximately 8,500 &#32;positions. These workforce reductions will primarily come from the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as research and development. The Company will also reduce its global real estate footprint and continue to improve the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply network. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $1.2 billion &#32;in 2013 &#32;related to this restructuring program. The actions under the 2013 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015 with the cumulative pretax costs estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion &#32;to $3.0 billion . The Company expects the actions under the 2013 Restructuring Program to result in annual net cost savings of approximately $2.0 billion by the end of 2015. The Company anticipates that the actions under the 2013 Restructuring Program, combined with remaining actions under the Merger Restructuring Program (discussed below), will result in annual net cost savings of $2.5 billion by the end of 2015 compared with full-year 2012 expense levels. \n\nThe global restructuring program (the &#8220;Merger Restructuring Program&#8221;) that was initiated in 2010 subsequent to the Merck and Schering-Plough Corporation (&#8220;Schering-Plough&#8221;) merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) is intended to streamline the cost structure of the combined company. The workforce reductions associated with this plan relate to the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as from the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and research and development sites and the consolidation of office facilities. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $1.1 billion &#32;in 2013 , $951 million &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $1.8 billion &#32;in 2011 &#32;related to this restructuring program. The restructuring actions under the Merger Restructuring Program were substantially completed by the end of 2013, with the exception of certain actions, principally manufacturing-related. Subsequent to the Merger, the Company has rationalized a number of manufacturing sites worldwide. The remaining actions under this program will result in additional manufacturing facility rationalizations, which are expected to be substantially completed by 2016. The Company expects the estimated total cumulative pretax costs for this program to be approximately $7.4 billion &#32;to $7.7 billion &#32;and to yield annual savings upon completion of the program of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.6 billion. \n\nCosts associated with the Company&#8217;s restructuring actions are included in Materials and production &#32;costs, Marketing and administrative &#32;expenses, Research and development &#32;expenses and Restructuring costs . The Company estimates that of the projected costs associated with the above mentioned restructuring programs, approximately two-thirds of the cumulative pretax costs relate to cash outlays, primarily related to employee separation expense. Approximately one-third of the cumulative pretax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. \n\nDuring 2013, the Company returned $11.7 billion of cash to shareholders through stock buy-back activity and dividend payments. Pursuant to a $15 billion share repurchase program approved in May 2013 by Merck&#8217;s Board of Directors, Merck entered into an accelerated share repurchase (&#8220;ASR&#8221;) agreement with Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co. (&#8220;Goldman Sachs&#8221;). Under the ASR, Merck repurchased 105 million shares of common stock for $5 billion utilizing funding from an underwritten public debt offering. Also, in November 2013, Merck&#8217;s Board of Directors raised the Company&#8217;s quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share from $0.43 per share. \n\nEarnings per common share assuming dilution attributable to common shareholders (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) for 2013 &#32;were $1.47 &#32;compared with $2.00 &#32;in 2012 . EPS in both years reflect a net unfavorable impact resulting from acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs, and certain other items. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes these items, were $3.49 &#32;in 2013 &#32;compared with $3.82 &#32;in 2012 &#32;(see &#8220;Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS&#8221; below). The decline in Non-GAAP EPS in 2013 as compared with 2012 was due primarily to lower sales reflecting the loss of market exclusivity for certain products, particularly Singulair , lower equity income and higher foreign exchange losses, partially offset by lower operating expenses. EPS in 2013 benefited from lower average shares outstanding due to the ASR program discussed above. \n\nCompetition and the Health Care Environment \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company&#8217;s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug and consumer and animal health care manufacturers. The Company&#8217;s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company&#8217;s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors&#8217; branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. \n\nPharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. Additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a \n\nstrong technical information service. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as joint ventures and licenses, and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company&#8217;s products in that therapeutic category. \n\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company&#8217;s products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s consumer care operations face competition from other consumer health care businesses as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands. The Company&#8217;s competitive position is affected by several factors, including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, the quality and price of the Company&#8217;s products, promotional efforts and the growth of lower cost private label brands. \n\nHealth Care Environment \n\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In the United States, federal and state governments for many years also have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010, which began to be implemented in 2010. Various insurance market reforms have advanced and will continue through full implementation in 2014. The law is expected to expand access to health care to about 32 million Americans by the end of the decade who did not previously have insurance coverage. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to Medicare Part D beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called &#8220;donut hole&#8221;). Approximately $280 million, $210 million and $150 million was recorded by Merck as a reduction to revenue in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee was $2.8 billion in 2013 and will be $3.0 billion in 2014. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Company recorded $151 million, $190 million and $162 million of costs within Marketing and administrative &#32;expenses in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. The full impact of U.S. health care reform cannot be predicted at this time. \n\nThe Company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i) practices of managed care groups, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. \n\nIn addition, in the effort to contain the U.S. federal deficit, the pharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls in the Medicare prescription drug program (Part D). In addition, Congress may again consider proposals to allow, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries. It remains very uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the Company. \n\nEfforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in several European countries. Many countries have continued to announce and execute austerity measures, which include the implementation of pricing actions to \n\nreduce prices of generic and patented drugs and mandatory switches to generic drugs. While the Company is taking steps to mitigate the impact in these countries, the austerity measures continued to negatively affect the Company&#8217;s revenue performance in 2013 and the Company anticipates the austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2014. In addition, a majority of countries attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs by brand. The authorities then use price data from those markets to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company&#8217;s. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations. \n\nIn addition, in Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order repricings for classes of drugs if it determines that it is appropriate under applicable rules. \n\nCertain markets outside of the United States have also implemented cost management strategies, such as health technology assessments, which require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s focus on and share of revenue from emerging markets has increased. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and related measures, such as compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in 2014 to varying degrees in the emerging markets. \n\nBeyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company&#8217;s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company&#8217;s risk exposure. \n\nIn addressing cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens&#8217; access to appropriate health care, including medicines. \n\nOperating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company&#8217;s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world. Governmental regulation and legislation tend to focus on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement, especially related to the pricing of products. \n\nOf particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. \n\nThe EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU member states. The Company&#8217;s policies and \n\nprocedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. \n\nAccess to Medicines \n\nAs a global health care company, Merck&#8217;s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its products around the world. The Company&#8217;s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company&#8217;s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. In addition, the Company has many far-reaching philanthropic programs. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the United States who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company&#8217;s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicine and vaccines. In 2011, Merck announced that it would launch &#8220;Merck for Mothers,&#8221; a long-term effort with global health partners to end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Through this initiative, Merck is leveraging its scientific and business expertise to help make proven solutions more widely available, develop new technologies and improve public and policymaker awareness of these issues. \n\nMerck has also in the past provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health. One of these partnerships is The African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership in Botswana, a collaboration with the government of Botswana that was renewed in 2010 and supports Botswana&#8217;s response to HIV/AIDS through a comprehensive and sustainable approach to HIV prevention, care, treatment, and support. \n\nPrivacy and Data Protection \n\nThe Company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company&#8217;s business, including recently enacted laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, and increased enforcement and litigation activity in the United States and other developed markets. \n\nOperating Results \n\nSales \n\nWorldwide sales totaled $44.0 billion in 2013, a decline of 7% compared with $47.3 billion in 2012. The sales decline was driven primarily by lower sales of Singulair . The patents that provided U.S. market exclusivity and market exclusivity in a number of major European markets for Singulair &#32;expired in August 2012 and February 2013, respectively, and the Company experienced a significant and rapid decline in Singulair &#32;sales in those markets thereafter. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 2% in 2013. The revenue decline in 2013 also reflects lower sales of Maxalt , Cozaar and Hyzaar, &#32;treatments for hypertension, Temodar , Clarinex , a non-sedating antihistamine, PegIntron, &#32;a treatment for chronic hepatitis C , Propecia , Fosamax , a treatment for osteoporosis, and Vytorin , a cholesterol modifying medicine. These declines were partially offset by growth in Gardasil , a vaccine to help prevent certain diseases caused by four types of HPV, Remicade &#32;and Simponi , treatments for inflammatory diseases, Janumet , a treatment for type 2 diabetes, Isentress , a treatment for HIV-1 infection, Dulera &#32;Inhalation Aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, and Zostavax , a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster). \n\nSales in the United States were $18.2 billion in 2013, a decline of 11% compared with $20.4 billion in 2012. The sales decrease was driven primarily by lower sales of Singulair , as well as Maxalt , &#32;Temodar , &#32;Victrelis , an oral medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus, and Clarinex , partially offset by higher sales of Gardasil , Zetia , a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, and Dulera Inhalation Aerosol. \n\nInternational sales were $25.8 billion in 2013, a decline of 4% compared with $26.9 billion in 2012. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected international sales performance by 4% in 2013. The decline was driven primarily by lower sales in the Pharmaceutical segment, reflecting declines in Japan, largely attributable to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, and Europe that were partially offset by growth in the emerging markets. Sales in Japan declined 21% in 2013, to $3.9 billion, of which 17% was due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The sales decline \n\nreflects the ongoing impacts of the loss of the market exclusivity for several products, including Cozaar and Hyzaar , as well as lower sales of Gardasil , reflecting the Japanese government&#8217;s decision to suspend proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines, and declines in PegIntron &#32;and Rebetol , products for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. These declines were partially offset by volume growth in Januvia , a treatment for type 2 diabetes, Nasonex , an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, Zetia , &#32;and RotaTeq , &#32; a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children. Sales in Europe declined 1% in 2013, to $9.6 billion, including a 2% favorable effect from foreign exchange driven by ongoing generic erosion and fiscal austerity measures in this region, partially offset by growth in Remicade , Simponi , &#32;Janumet , &#32;Januvia &#32;and Isentress . Sales in the emerging markets grew 3% in 2013, to $7.8 billion, including a 4% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange reflecting higher sales of vaccine, hospital, hepatitis and immunology products, partially offset by lower sales of Singulair &#32;and diversified brands. Total international sales represented 59% &#32;and 57% &#32;of total sales in 2013 &#32;and 2012 , respectively. \n\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. In many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, other austerity measures negatively affected the Company&#8217;s revenue performance in 2013. The Company anticipates these pricing actions, including the biennial price reductions in Japan, and other austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2014. \n\nIn October 2013, the Company sold its active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;) manufacturing business and, effective December 31, 2013, certain related products within Diversified Brands. In November 2013, Merck sold the U.S. rights to certain ophthalmic products and in January 2014 sold the U.S. rights to Saphris . The aggregate annual sales associated with these divested assets were approximately $625 million. The annual sales associated with the divested products were approximately $425 million of which approximately $385 million related to the Pharmaceutical segment and $40 million related to the Consumer Care segment. The annual sales associated with the divested API manufacturing business were approximately $200 million and related to non-segment revenues. \n\nWorldwide sales were $47.3 billion in 2012, a decline of 2% compared with $48.0 billion in 2011. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3%. The sales decrease was driven primarily by Singulair , which lost market exclusivity in the United States in August 2012 resulting in a significant and rapid decline in U.S. Singulair &#32;sales. The sales decline was also driven by lower sales of Remicade , largely as a result of the arbitration settlement agreement reached in 2011 as discussed below. In addition, lower sales of Cozaar and Hyzaar , Clarinex , Fosamax , Vytorin , Primaxin , an anti-bacterial product, and Avelox , a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, as well as lower revenue from the Company&#8217;s relationship with AstraZeneca LP (&#8220;AZLP&#8221;) also contributed to the sales decline in 2012. These declines were largely offset by higher sales of Januvia , Gardasil , Victrelis , Zostavax , Janumet , Isentress , Zetia , and Dulera &#32;Inhalation Aerosol, as well as by higher sales of the Company&#8217;s animal health and consumer care products. \n\nSales of the Company&#8217;s products were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPrimary Care and Women&#8217;s Health \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCardiovascular \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nZetia \n\n$ \n\n2,658 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,567 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,428 \n\nVytorin \n\n1,643 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,747 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,882 \n\nDiabetes and Obesity \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJanuvia \n\n4,004 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,086 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,324 \n\nJanumet \n\n1,829 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,659 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,363 \n\nRespiratory \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNasonex \n\n1,335 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,268 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,286 \n\nSingulair \n\n1,196 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,853 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,479 \n\nDulera \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsmanex \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWomen&#8217;s Health and Endocrine \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNuvaRing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFosamax \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFollistim AQ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nImplanon \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCerazette \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nArcoxia \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAvelox \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHospital and Specialty \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nImmunology \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRemicade \n\n2,271 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,076 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,667 \n\nSimponi \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInfectious Disease \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIsentress \n\n1,643 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,515 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,359 \n\nCancidas \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPegIntron \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInvanz \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVictrelis \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNoxafil \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOncology \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTemodar \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmend \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCosopt/Trusopt \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBridion \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIntegrilin \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDiversified Brands \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCozaar/Hyzaar \n\n1,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,284 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,663 \n\nPrimaxin \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nZocor \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPropecia \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nClarinex \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRemeron \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nClaritin Rx \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProscar \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMaxalt \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVaccines (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGardasil \n\n1,831 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,631 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,209 \n\nProQuad/M-M-R II /Varivax \n\n1,306 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,202 \n\nZostavax \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPneumovax 23 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRotaTeq \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther pharmaceutical (2) \n\n4,316 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,333 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,266 \n\nTotal Pharmaceutical segment sales \n\n37,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n40,601 \n\n&#160; \n\n41,289 \n\nOther segment sales (3) \n\n6,325 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,412 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,428 \n\nTotal segment sales \n\n43,762 \n\n&#160; \n\n47,013 \n\n&#160; \n\n47,717 \n\nOther (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n44,033 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n47,267 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n48,047 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nThese amounts do not reflect sales of vaccines sold in most major European markets through the Company&#8217;s joint venture, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, the results of which are reflected in Equity income from affiliates . These amounts do, however, reflect supply sales to Sanofi Pasteur MSD. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nOther pharmaceutical primarily reflects sales of other human health pharmaceutical products, including products within the franchises not listed separately. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nRepresents the non-reportable segments of Animal Health, Consumer Care and Alliances. The Alliances segment includes revenue from the Company&#8217;s relationship with AZLP. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nOther revenues are primarily comprised of miscellaneous corporate revenues, third-party manufacturing sales, sales related to divested products or businesses and other supply sales not included in segment results. As discussed above, on October 1, 2013, the Company divested a substantial portion of its third-party manufacturing sales. In addition, other revenues in 2013 reflect $50 million of revenue for the out-license of a pipeline compound. \n\n##TABLE_END 42 \n\nPharmaceutical Segment \n\nPrimary Care and Women&#8217;s Health \n\nCardiovascular \n\nWorldwide sales of Zetia &#32;(also marketed as Ezetrol &#32;outside the United States), a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, were $2.7 billion in 2013, an increase of 4% compared with 2012 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales increase primarily reflects favorable pricing in the United States and volume growth in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange particularly in Japan. Sales of Zetia &#32;increased 6% in 2012 to $2.6 billion, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales increase reflects positive performance in the United States due to pricing, as well as volume growth in Japan, partially offset by volume declines in the United States. \n\nGlobal sales of Vytorin &#32;(marketed outside the United States as Inegy ), a combination product containing the active ingredients of both Zetia &#32;and Zocor , a statin for modifying cholesterol, were $1.6 billion in 2013, a decline of 6% compared with 2012, driven primarily by lower volumes in the United States and Latin America, partially offset by volume growth in the Asia Pacific region. Worldwide sales of Vytorin &#32;declined 7% in 2012 to $1.7 billion, including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales decline reflects volume declines in the United States, partially offset by pricing in the United States and volume growth in certain international markets. \n\nIn March 2013, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (the &#8220;DSMB&#8221;) of the IMPROVE-IT trial, a large cardiovascular outcomes study evaluating ezetimibe/simvastatin against simvastatin alone in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, completed its planned review of study data and recommended that the study continue. Merck remains blinded to the actual results of this analysis and to other IMPROVE-IT safety and efficacy data. IMPROVE-IT is an 18,000 patient event-driven trial and, based on the targeted number of 5,250 clinical endpoints and the rate at which events are being reported, the trial is projected to conclude later in 2014. If the results of the IMPROVE-IT trial fail to demonstrate an incremental benefit of ezetimibe/simvastatin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin, sales of Zetia &#32;and Vytorin &#32;could be materially adversely affected and, if so, the Company may take non-cash impairment charges with respect to the carrying values of the Zetia &#32;and Vytorin &#32;intangible assets, which were $4.7 billion &#32;and $2.6 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2013 and such charges could be material. \n\nDiabetes and Obesity \n\nGlobal sales of Januvia , Merck&#8217;s dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (&#8220;DPP-4&#8221;) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were $4.0 billion in 2013, a decline of 2% compared with 2012 including a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Excluding the negative effect from foreign exchange, sales performance in 2013 compared with 2012 reflects volume growth in Japan, positive performance in Europe and the emerging markets, partially offset by declines in the United States reflecting lowering demand. Worldwide sales of Januvia &#32;rose 23% to $4.1 billion in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting volume growth in the United States, as well as in international markets, particularly in Japan. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 2% in 2012. In 2014, the Company anticipates that all DPP-4 inhibitors, including Januvia , will be subject to repricing in Japan. \n\nThe Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes after treatment with Sitagliptin (&#8220;TECOS&#8221;), an event-driven, cardiovascular outcomes study for sitagliptin, began in 2008 and has over 14,000 patients enrolled. TECOS will evaluate the impact of sitagliptin when added to usual care compared to usual care without sitagliptin in a large, high-risk type 2 diabetes population across multiple countries. TECOS is expected to be completed later in 2014. \n\nWorldwide sales of Janumet , Merck&#8217;s oral antihyperglycemic agent that combines sitagliptin ( Januvia) &#32;with metformin in a single tablet, were $1.8 billion in 2013, an increase of 10% compared with 2012, driven primarily by volume growth outside the United States. Global sales of Janumet &#32;were $1.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 22% compared with 2011, reflecting volume growth in the United States, the emerging markets and Europe. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 4% in 2012. \n\nGlobal sales of the combined diabetes franchise of Januvia/Janumet &#32;were $5.8 billion in 2013, an increase of 2% compared with 2012 including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, and were $5.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 23% compared with 2011 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. \n\nRespiratory \n\nGlobal sales of Nasonex , an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, increased 5% to $1.3 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by increases in the United States, reflecting net favorable adjustments to indirect customer discounts, as well as by volume growth in Japan, partially offset by declines in Latin America, Canada and Europe. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2013. By agreement, generic manufacturers were able to launch a generic version of Nasonex &#32;in most European markets on January 1, 2014 and generic versions of Nasonex &#32;have since launched in several of these markets. Accordingly, the Company anticipates a rapid decline in Nasonex &#32;sales in Europe in 2014. Sales of Nasonex &#32;in Europe were $207 million in 2013. In 2009, Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, &#8220;Apotex&#8221;) filed an application with the FDA seeking approval to sell its generic version of Nasonex . In June 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled against the Company in a patent infringement suit against Apotex holding that Apotex&#8217;s generic version of Nasonex &#32;does not infringe on the Company&#8217;s formulation patent. In June 2013, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision affirming the U.S. District Court decision and the Company has exhausted all of its appeal options. If Apotex&#8217;s generic version becomes available, significant losses of U.S. Nasonex &#32;sales could occur and the Company may take a non-cash impairment charge with respect to the carrying value of the Nasonex &#32;intangible asset, which was $1.3 billion &#32;at December 31, 2013 . If the Nasonex &#32;intangible asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment charge could be material. U.S. sales of Nasonex &#32;were $681 million in 2013 . Worldwide sales of Nasonex &#32;declined 1% in 2012 to $1.3 billion, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales performance in 2012 compared with 2011 reflects price declines in Europe and lower volumes in the United States, largely offset by higher prices in the United States. \n\nWorldwide sales of Singulair, &#32;a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, fell 69% to $1.2 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by lower sales in the United States and Europe as a result of generic competition. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Singulair &#32;expired in August 2012 and the Company has lost nearly all sales of Singulair &#32;in the United States. In addition, the patents that provided market exclusivity for Singulair &#32;expired in a number of major European markets in February 2013 and the Company experienced a significant and rapid reduction in sales of Singulair &#32;in those markets following the patent expiries and expects the decline to continue. The patent that provides market exclusivity for Singulair &#32;in Japan will expire in 2016. &#32;Singulair &#32;sales in Japan were $523 million in 2013. Global sales of Singulair &#32;declined 30% to $3.9 billion in 2012 compared with 2011 driven primarily by lower sales in the United States. Revenue declines in Europe, Canada and Latin America also contributed to the Singulair &#32;sales decline in 2012. \n\nGlobal sales of Dulera &#32;Inhalation Aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, were $324 million in 2013, $207 million in 2012 and $96 million in 2011 reflecting higher demand in the United States. Dulera &#32;Inhalation Aerosol was approved by the FDA in June 2010. In January 2012, Merck received a CRL from the FDA on the Company&#8217;s supplemental New Drug Application for Dulera &#32;Inhalation Aerosol for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Company has determined not to conduct an additional clinical study and will no longer pursue an update to the application. \n\nWomen&#8217;s Health and Endocrine \n\nWorldwide sales of NuvaRing , a vaginal contraceptive product, were $686 million in 2013, an increase of 10% compared with 2012, primarily reflecting volume growth and favorable pricing in the United States. Global sales of NuvaRing &#32;were $623 million in 2012, comparable with sales in 2011. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 3% in 2012. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales performance in 2012 reflects volume growth in the emerging markets and positive performance in Europe. \n\nWorldwide sales of Fosamax &#32;(marketed as Fosamac &#32;in Japan) and Fosamax Plus D &#32;(marketed as Fosavance &#32;throughout the EU) for the treatment and, in the case of Fosamax , prevention of osteoporosis, declined 17% in 2013 to $560 million and decreased 21% in 2012 to $676 million driven by declines in most regions. These medicines have lost market exclusivity in the United States and in most major international markets. The Company expects the sales declines within the Fosamax &#32;product franchise to continue. \n\nGlobal sales of Follistim AQ &#32;(marketed in most countries outside the United States as Puregon ), a fertility treatment, grew 3% to $481 million in 2013 compared with 2012 driven largely by positive performance in the United States. Sales of Follistim AQ &#32;declined 12% in 2012 to $468 million, including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign \n\nexchange, driven largely by declines in Europe resulting from supply issues and pricing. Puregon &#32;lost market exclusivity in the EU in August 2009. \n\nWorldwide sales of Implanon , a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, grew 16% to $403 million in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the United States that was partially offset by declines in the emerging markets from pricing pressures. Implanon &#32;sales increased 18% in 2012 to $348 million, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting volume growth in the emerging markets and in the United States. \n\nIn recent years, the Company experienced difficulties manufacturing certain women&#8217;s health products. The Company has resolved these issues, which were not material to the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nOther \n\nOther products included in Primary Care and Women&#8217;s Health include among others, Asmanex Twisthaler , an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma; Cerazette , a progestin only oral contraceptive; Arcoxia , for the treatment of arthritis and pain and Avelox , a broad-spectrum fluroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections marketed by the Company in the United States. The patent that provides U.S. market exclusivity for Avelox &#32;expires in March 2014. \n\nHospital and Specialty \n\nImmunology \n\nSales of Remicade, &#32;a treatment for inflammatory diseases (marketed by the Company in Europe, Russia and Turkey), were $2.3 billion in 2013, an increase of 9% compared with 2012 including a 2% favorable effect from foreign exchange. Sales growth reflects volume growth in Europe, as well as Russia. In September 2013, the EC approved an infliximab biosimilar. While the Company is experiencing generic competition in certain smaller European markets, the Company anticipates a more substantial decline in Remicade &#32;sales following loss of market exclusivity in major European markets in February 2015. Sales of Remicade &#32;were $2.1 billion in 2012, a decline of 22% compared with 2011 including a 6% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Prior to July 1, 2011, Remicade &#32;was marketed by the Company outside of the United States (except in Japan and certain other Asian markets). As a result of the agreement reached in April 2011 to amend the agreement governing the distribution rights to Remicade &#32;and Simponi , effective July 1, 2011, Merck relinquished marketing rights for these products in certain territories including Canada, Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Merck retained exclusive marketing rights throughout Europe, Russia and Turkey (the &#8220;Retained Territories&#8221;). In the Retained Territories, Remicade &#32;sales declined 2% in 2012, which reflects an 8% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and volume growth in Europe. \n\nSales of Simponi , a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases (marketed by the Company in Europe, Russia and Turkey), were $500 million in 2013, $331 million in 2012 and $264 million in 2011 driven by continued launch activities. Simponi &#32;was approved by the European Commission (the &#8220;EC&#8221;) in October 2009. In September 2013, the EC approved Simponi &#32;for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n\nInfectious Disease \n\nWorldwide sales of Isentress, &#32;an HIV integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, grew 8% to $1.6 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the United States and Europe. Global sales of Isentress &#32;grew 11% in 2012 to $1.5 billion compared with 2011 driven primarily by volume growth in the United States, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 1% in 2013 and 4% in 2012. \n\nGlobal sales of Cancidas , an anti-fungal product, increased 7% to $660 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting growth in most emerging markets, as well as in Europe and Japan. Sales of Cancidas &#32;declined 3% in 2012 to $619 million, which reflects a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and growth in the emerging markets. \n\nWorldwide sales of PegIntron , a treatment for chronic hepatitis C, declined 24% to $496 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting declines in all regions. The Company believes the sales declines are attributable in part to patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available. \n\nForeign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2013. Global sales of PegIntron declined 1% in 2012 to $653 million, including an unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of 4%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales performance reflects volume growth and favorable pricing in the United States and volume growth in certain emerging markets. \n\nGlobal sales of Victrelis , an oral medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, were $428 million in 2013, a decline of 15% compared with 2012 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Sales declines in the United States, Europe and Canada were partially offset by growth across the emerging markets. The Company believes the sales declines in the United States, Europe and Canada are attributable in part to patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available. Sales of Victrelis &#32;were $502 million in 2012 compared with $140 million in 2011, driven by post-launch growth in the United States and internationally, particularly in Europe. Victrelis &#32;was approved by the FDA in May 2011 and by the EC in July 2011. \n\nSales of the Company&#8217;s products indicated for treatment of chronic hepatitis C including Victrelis and PegIntron discussed above, as well as Rebetol , continued to be adversely affected in 2013 by patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available. Sales of Rebetol , a product sold almost entirely in international markets, were particularly adversely affected by this trend given the markets where Rebetol &#32;is sold, as well as from generic competition. Worldwide sales of Rebetol declined 43% in 2013 to $74 million driven by declines in Japan and Europe. Cash flow revisions in the fourth quarter of 2013 indicated that the Rebetol &#32;intangible asset value was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. Utilizing market participant assumptions, the Company concluded that its best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Rebetol &#32;was $94 million at December 31 2013, which resulted in an impairment charge of $156 million &#32;recorded within Materials and production &#32;costs. In the event that the availability of new treatment options adversely affects sales of products currently marketed by the Company for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C to a greater extent than anticipated by the Company, or in the event other circumstances arise that significantly reduce cash flow projections for these products, the Company may record additional intangible asset impairment charges in the future and such charges could be material. The carrying value of the intangible assets related to these products was $1.3 billion &#32;in the aggregate at December 31, 2013. \n\nOncology \n\nSales of Temodar &#32;(marketed as Temodal &#32;outside the United States), a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, declined 23% to $708 million in 2013 compared with 2012. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2013. The sales decline was driven primarily by generic competition in the United States and Europe. As previously disclosed, by agreement, a generic manufacturer launched a generic version of Temodar &#32;in the United States in August 2013. The U.S. patent and exclusivity periods otherwise expired in February 2014. Temodar &#32;lost patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines due to the loss of exclusivity in these markets and the Company expects these declines to continue. Sales of Temodar &#32;decreased 2% in 2012 to $917 million, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Sales declines in Europe from generic competition were offset by price increases in the United States. \n\nGlobal sales of Emend , for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and post-operative nausea and vomiting, were $507 million in 2013, an increase of 4% compared with 2012 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, largely reflecting volume growth in the United States and the emerging markets, partially offset by a decline in Japan. Sales of Emend &#32;were $489 million in 2012, an increase of 17% compared with 2011 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting volume growth in the United States and Japan. \n\nOther \n\nWorldwide sales of ophthalmic products Cosopt &#32;and Trusopt &#32;were $416 million in 2013, a decline of 6% compared with 2012, reflecting a 7% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and lower sales in Europe and Canada due to generic competition, partially offset by volume growth in Japan. The patent for Cosopt &#32;expired in a number of major European markets in March 2013 and the Company is experiencing sales declines in those markets. The patents that provided market exclusivity for Cosopt &#32;and Trusopt &#32;in the United States and for Trusopt &#32;in a number of major European markets had previously expired. Sales of Cosopt &#32;and Trusopt &#32;were $444 million in 2012, a decline of 7% compared with 2011 including a 4% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales decline primarily reflects lower sales in Europe due to generic erosion and price reductions, mitigated in part by higher Cosopt &#32;sales in Japan. \n\nIn November 2013, Merck sold the U.S. rights to ophthalmic products Cosopt , Cosopt PF &#32;and AzaSite to Akorn, Inc. The annual U.S. sales associated with these ophthalmic products were approximately $45 million. \n\nBridion &#32;(sugammadex sodium injection), for the reversal of certain muscle relaxants used during surgery, is approved and has been launched in many countries outside of the United States. Sales of Bridion &#32;were $288 million in 2013, an increase of 10% compared with 2012. The sales growth was driven by volume growth in Europe, the emerging markets and Japan, partially offset by a 13% unfavorable effect of foreign exchange primarily on sales in Japan. Sales of Bridion &#32;grew 30% in 2012 to $261 million driven primarily by higher sales in Japan and the emerging markets. In September 2013, the Company received a CRL from the FDA for the resubmission of the NDA for sugammadex sodium injection (see &#8220;Research and Development&#8221; below). \n\nSaphris &#32;(asenapine), an antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in adults, was previously marketed by the Company in the United States. Merck&#8217;s sales of Saphris &#32;were $158 million in 2013, $166 million in 2012 and $120 million in 2011. Asenapine, sold under the brand name Sycrest , is also approved in the EU for the treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults. Under a commercialization agreement for Sycrest &#32;sublingual tablets (5 mg, 10 mg), H. Lundbeck A/S (&#8220;Lundbeck&#8221;) makes product supply payments in exchange for exclusive commercial rights to Sycrest &#32;in all markets outside the United States, China and Japan. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company reduced cash flow projections for Saphris/Sycrest &#32;as a result of reduced expectations in international markets and in the United States. These revisions to cash flows indicated that the Saphris/Sycrest &#32;intangible asset value was not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. The Company utilized market participant assumptions and considered several different scenarios to determine its best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to Saphris/Sycrest &#32;that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in an impairment charge of $330 million reflected in Materials and production &#32;costs. In January 2014, Merck sold the U.S. rights to Saphris &#32;to Forest Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;Forest&#8221;). Under the terms of the agreement, Forest will make upfront payments of approximately $230 million and will make additional payments to Merck based on defined sales milestones. \n\nOther products contained in Hospital and Specialty include among others, Invanz , for the treatment of certain infections; Noxafil , for the prevention of certain invasive fungal infections; and Integrilin, a treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold by the Company in the United States and Canada. \n\nDiversified Brands \n\nMerck&#8217;s diversified brands include human health pharmaceutical products that are approaching the expiration of their marketing exclusivity or are no longer protected by patents in developed markets, but continue to be a core part of the Company&#8217;s offering in other markets around the world. \n\nGlobal sales of Cozaar &#32;and its companion agent Hyzaar &#32;(a combination of Cozaar &#32;and hydrochlorothiazide), treatments for hypertension, were $1.0 billion in 2013, a decline of 22% compared with 2012 including an 8% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The decline was driven largely by lower sales in Japan, Europe and Canada due to generic competition and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, particularly on sales in Japan. Sales of Cozaar/Hyzaar &#32;decreased 23% in 2012 to $1.3 billion driven by declines in most regions. The patents that provided market exclusivity for Cozaar &#32;and Hyzaar &#32;in the United States and in a number of major international markets have expired. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing significant declines in Cozaar &#32;and Hyzaar &#32;sales and the Company expects the declines to continue. \n\nWorldwide sales of Propecia , a product for the treatment of male pattern hair loss, were $283 million in 2013, a decline of 33% compared with 2012 including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The decline was driven primarily by generic competition in the United States, as well as by lower sales in Japan due largely to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The Company lost U.S. market exclusivity for Propecia &#32;in 2013 and multiple generics have entered the market. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in U.S. sales of Propecia &#32;and expects the decline to continue. Sales of Propecia &#32;declined 5% in 2012 to $424 million compared with 2011 driven by declines in Europe and the United States, partially offset by increases in the Asia Pacific region. \n\nGlobal sales of Clarinex &#32;(marketed as Aerius &#32;in many countries outside the United States), a non-sedating antihistamine, declined 40% in 2013 to $235 million and decreased 37% in 2012 to $393 million driven by lower volumes in the United States and Europe as a result of generic competition. The Company anticipates that sales of Clarinex &#32;will continue to decline. \n\nGlobal sales of Maxalt , a product for the acute treatment of migraine, fell 77% in 2013 to $149 million as compared with 2012 driven primarily by lower volumes in the United States due to generic competition. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Maxalt &#32;expired in December 2012 and the Company experienced a significant and rapid decline in U.S. Maxalt &#32;sales thereafter. In addition, the patents that provided market exclusivity for Maxalt &#32;expired in a number of major European markets in August 2013 and the Company is experiencing sales declines in those markets as well. Sales of Maxalt &#32;were $638 million in 2012, comparable with sales in 2011, reflecting higher sales in the United States driven by favorable pricing, offset by volume declines in Europe and Canada due to generic erosion. \n\nOther products contained in Diversified Brands include among others, Primaxin , an anti-bacterial product; Zocor , a statin for modifying cholesterol; prescription Claritin , a treatment for seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies; Remeron , an antidepressant; and Proscar, &#32;a urology product for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostate enlargement. \n\nVaccines \n\nThe following discussion of vaccines does not include sales of vaccines sold in most major European markets through Sanofi Pasteur MSD (&#8220;SPMSD&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s joint venture with Sanofi Pasteur, the results of which are reflected in Equity income from affiliates &#32;(see &#8220;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#8221; below). Supply sales to SPMSD, however, are included. \n\nMerck&#8217;s sales of Gardasil , a vaccine to help prevent certain diseases caused by four types of HPV, grew 12% to $1.8 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the United States, reflecting continued uptake in both males and females, and volume growth in Latin America, partially offset by lower volumes in Japan. Sales in 2013 and 2012 included $37 million and $44 million, respectively, of purchases for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile. On June 14, 2013, the Japanese Health Ministry issued an advisory to suspend active promotion of HPV vaccines. Accordingly, the Company recorded almost no sales of Gardasil &#32;in Japan in the second half of 2013. Merck&#8217;s sales of Gardasil &#32;rose 35% in 2012 to $1.6 billion compared with 2011 driven primarily by growth in the United States, reflecting continued uptake in males and higher government purchases for the CDC Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile, as well as growth in the emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, and in Japan. The Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements with respect to Gardasil &#32;(including a cross-license and settlement agreement with GlaxoSmithKline). As a result of these agreements, the Company pays royalties on worldwide Gardasil &#32;sales of 21% to 27% which vary by country and are included in Materials and production &#32;costs. \n\nMerck&#8217;s sales of ProQuad , a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, were $314 million in 2013, $61 million in 2012 and $34 million in 2011. Sales of ProQuad &#32;in 2012 and 2011 were affected by supply constraints. ProQuad &#32;became available again in the United States for ordering in October 2012. \n\nMerck&#8217;s sales of Varivax, &#32;a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), were $684 million in 2013, $846 million in 2012 and $831 million in 2011. Merck&#8217;s sales of M-M-R &#32;II, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, were $307 million in 2013, $365 million in 2012 and $337 million in 2011. Sales of Varivax &#32;and M&#8209;M&#8209;R II declined in 2013 due to the availability of ProQuad &#32;discussed above. \n\nMerck&#8217;s sales of Zostavax, &#32;a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster) in adults 50 years of age and older, were $758 million in 2013, $651 million in 2012 and $332 million in 2011. Sales growth in 2013 as compared with 2012 was driven by higher demand in the United States and Canada, as well as by launches within the Asia Pacific region. The Company is continuing to launch Zostavax &#32;outside of the United States. Sales of Zostavax &#32;in 2011 were affected by supply issues. \n\nMerck&#8217;s sales of Pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, grew 13% in 2013 to $653 million compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the emerging markets, as well as volume and price increases in the United States. Merck&#8217;s sales of Pneumovax &#32;23 increased 17% in 2012 to $580 million due primarily to growth in the United States as a result of price increases and higher volumes, partially offset by declines in Japan. \n\nMerck&#8217;s sales of RotaTeq, &#32;a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, grew 6% in 2013 to $636 million compared with 2012 reflecting higher pricing in the United States and volume growth \n\nin Japan. Merck&#8217;s sales of RotaTeq &#32;declined 8% in 2012 to $601 million reflecting favorable public sector inventory fluctuations in 2011, partially offset by volume growth in the emerging markets and Japan in 2012. \n\nOther Segments \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other segments are the Animal Health, Consumer Care and Alliances segments, which are not material for separate reporting. In January 2014, the Company announced that it was evaluating the respective roles of Merck&#8217;s Animal Health and Consumer Care businesses in the Company&#8217;s strategy for long-term value creation. The Company expects to complete the evaluation process and take action, if any, in 2014. The Company could reach different decisions about the two businesses. \n\nAnimal Health \n\nAnimal Health includes pharmaceutical and vaccine products for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major farm and companion animal species. Animal Health sales are affected by competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. Global sales of Animal Health products were $3.4 billion in 2013, a decline of 1% compared with 2012 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales decline reflects lower sales of ruminant products, primarily Zilmax , partially offset by growth in companion animal and poultry products. In August 2013, Merck Animal Health voluntarily suspended sales of Zilmax , a feed supplement for beef cattle, in the United States and Canada. The suspension of Zilmax &#32;unfavorably affected Animal Health sales by 2% in 2013. Sales of Animal Health products were $3.4 billion in 2012, an increase of 4% compared with 2011 including a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, driven by positive performance among ruminant, poultry, companion animal and swine products. \n\nConsumer Care \n\nConsumer Care products include over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products such as Claritin &#32;non-drowsy antihistamines; MiraLAX , for the relief of occasional constipation; Dr. Scholl&#8217;s &#32;foot care products; and Coppertone &#32;sun care products. Consumer Care product sales are affected by competition and consumer spending patterns. Global sales of Consumer Care products were $1.9 billion in 2013, a decline of 3% compared with 2012 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales decline in 2013 resulted from the termination in China of certain Consumer Care distribution arrangements and a reversal of sales previously made to these distributors, together with associated termination costs. Excluding these items, Consumer Care global sales would have increased by 1% in 2013 compared with 2012, including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting higher sales of women&#8217;s health products, partially offset by lower sales of foot care products. In 2013, the Company launched Oxytrol for Women , the first and only over-the-counter treatment for overactive bladder in women. Consumer care product sales grew 6% in 2012, including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, to $2.0 billion reflecting higher sales of Dr. Scholl&#8217;s , Coppertone , MiraLAX &#32;and Claritin , partially offset by lower sales of Marvelon , an oral contraceptive, which is an over-the-counter product in China. \n\nAs discussed above, on December 31, 2013, the Company divested certain products to Aspen. Annual sales of these products reflected within Consumer Care were approximately $40 million. \n\nAlliances \n\nThe alliances segment includes results from the Company&#8217;s relationship with AZLP. Revenue from AZLP, primarily relating to sales of Nexium and Prilosec, was $920 million &#32;in 2013 , $915 million &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $1.2 billion &#32;in 2011 . AstraZeneca has an option to buy Merck&#8217;s interest in a subsidiary, and through it, Merck&#8217;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec, exercisable in 2014, and the Company believes that it is likely that AstraZeneca will exercise that option (see &#8220;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#8221; below). If AstraZeneca exercises its option, the Company will no longer record equity income from AZLP and supply sales to AZLP will terminate. In addition, the Company will recognize a non-cash pretax gain of approximately $700 million. \n\nCosts, Expenses and Other \n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nMaterials and production \n\n$ \n\n16,954 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,446 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,871 \n\nMarketing and administrative \n\n11,911 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n12,776 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n13,733 \n\nResearch and development (1) &#160; \n\n7,503 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n8,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n8,467 \n\nRestructuring costs \n\n1,709 \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,306 \n\nEquity income from affiliates \n\n(404 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(642 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(610 \n\n) \n\nOther (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,116 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n40,713 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n* 100% or greater. \n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nIncludes $279 million , $200 million &#32;and $587 million &#32;of IPR&#38;D impairment charges in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nMaterials and Production \n\nMaterials and production costs were $17.0 billion &#32;in 2013 , $16.4 billion &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $16.9 billion &#32;in 2011 . Costs include expenses for the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions which totaled $4.7 billion in 2013 and $4.9 billion in each of 2012 and 2011. Additionally, expenses in 2011 include $89 million of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to Schering-Plough&#8217;s inventories recognized as a result of the Merger. Costs in 2013 and 2011 include intangible asset impairment charges of $486 million &#32;and $118 million, respectively. The impairment charges in 2013 related to changes in cash flow assumptions for currently marked products Saphris/Sycrest &#32;and Rebetol &#32;(see &#8220;Pharmaceutical Segment&#8221; above). The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to product intangibles that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with mergers and acquisitions and such charges could be material. Additionally, costs in 2013 include a $41 million intangible asset impairment charge related to a licensing agreement. Also included in materials and production were costs associated with restructuring activities which amounted to $446 million , $188 million &#32;and $348 million &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively, including accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. Separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs &#32;as discussed below. \n\nGross margin was 61.5% in 2013 &#32;compared with 65.2% in 2012 &#32;and 64.9% in 2011 . The amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as the restructuring and impairment charges noted above reduced gross margin by 12.8 percentage points in 2013 , 10.7 percentage points in 2012 &#32;and 11.4 percentage points in 2011 . Excluding these impacts, the gross margin decline in 2013 as compared with 2012 was driven in part by the loss of Singulair &#32;sales as result of patent expiries in the United States in August 2012 and in major European markets in February 2013. In addition, generic competition in the United States for Maxalt , Temodar , Clarinex &#32;and Propecia &#32;coupled with changes in product mix and continued pricing pressures in mature markets also negatively affected gross margin in 2013. The gross margin decline in 2012 as compared with 2011 reflects the significant decline in Singulair &#32;sales as a result of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity, partially offset by improvements resulting from other changes in product mix. The Company anticipates that gross margin will continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing impacts of recent patent expiries and additional patent expiries that will occur in 2014. \n\nMarketing and Administrative \n\nMarketing and administrative expenses declined 7% in 2013 to $11.9 billion and decreased 7% in 2012 to $12.8 billion largely due to lower promotional spending and selling costs resulting from restructuring activities, and also reflecting the favorable effect of foreign exchange. Expenses for 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;include restructuring costs of $145 million , $90 million &#32;and $119 million , respectively, related primarily to accelerated depreciation for facilities to be closed or divested. Separation costs associated with sales force reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs &#32;as discussed below. Expenses also include $94 million, $272 million and $278 million of acquisition-related costs in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, consisting of incremental, third-party integration costs related to the Merger, including costs related to legal entity and system integration. Acquisition-related costs for 2011 also consist of severance costs associated with the acquisition of Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which are not part of the Company&#8217;s formal restructuring programs. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nResearch and development expenses were $7.5 billion &#32;in 2013 , $8.2 billion &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $8.5 billion &#32;in 2011 . Research and development expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (&#8220;MRL&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were approximately $4.2 billion in 2013 and $4.5 billion in each of 2012 and 2011. Also included in research and development expenses are costs incurred by other divisions in support of research and development activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, as well as licensing activity, certain costs from operating segments, including the Pharmaceutical, Animal Health and Consumer Care segments, which in the aggregate were $2.9 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decline in research and development costs in 2013 as compared with 2012 was due to targeted reductions and lower clinical development spend as a result of portfolio prioritization, as well as lower payments for licensing activity. Research and development expenses in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were favorably affected by cost savings resulting from restructuring activities. \n\nResearch and development expenses also include in-process research and development (&#8220;IPR&#38;D&#8221;) impairment charges of $279 million , $200 million &#32;and $587 million &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively (see &#8220;Research and Development&#8221; below). The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future for the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with mergers and acquisitions and such charges could be material. Research and development expenses in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;reflect $101 million , $57 million &#32;and $138 million , respectively, of accelerated depreciation and asset abandonment costs associated with restructuring activities. In 2012, the Company recorded an adjustment to accelerated depreciation costs included in research and development expenses revising previously recorded amounts for certain facilities. \n\nRestructuring Costs \n\nRestructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs associated with restructuring activities, were $1.7 billion , $664 million &#32;and $1.3 billion &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. Costs in 2013 include $898 million &#32;of costs related to the 2013 Restructuring Program. Nearly all of the remaining costs recorded in 2013 and the costs recorded in 2012 and 2011 related to the Merger Restructuring Program. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, separation costs of $1.4 billion, $489 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, were incurred associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Merck eliminated approximately 6,070 &#32;positions in 2013 (of which 1,540 &#32;related to the 2013 Restructuring Program, 4,475 &#32;related to the Merger Restructuring Program and 55 &#32;related to the 2008 Restructuring Program), approximately 4,255 positions in 2012 (of which 3,975 related to the Merger Restructuring Program, 155 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program and 125 related to the legacy Schering-Plough program), and approximately 7,590 positions in 2011 (of which 6,880 related to the Merger Restructuring Program, 450 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program and 260 related to the legacy Schering-Plough program). These position eliminations are comprised of actual headcount reductions, and the elimination of contractors and vacant positions. Also included in restructuring costs are curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans, share-based compensation plan costs, as well as contract termination and shutdown costs. For segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses. Additional costs associated with the Company&#8217;s restructuring activities are included in Materials and production , Marketing and administrative &#32;and Research and development &#32;as discussed above. \n\nEquity Income from Affiliates \n\nEquity income from affiliates, which reflects the performance of the Company&#8217;s joint ventures and other equity method affiliates, declined 37% in 2013 to $404 million &#32;compared with 2012 driven primarily by lower equity income from AZLP, partially offset by higher equity income from SPMSD. Equity income from affiliates increased 5% in 2012 to $642 million due primarily to higher equity income from AZLP. During 2011, the Company divested its interest in the Johnson &#38; Johnson&#176;Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Company (&#8220;JJMCP&#8221;) joint venture. (See &#8220;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#8221; below.) \n\nOther (Income) Expense, Net \n\nOther (income) expense, net was $815 million &#32;of expense in 2013 compared with $1.1 billion &#32;of expense in 2012 reflecting a $493 million net charge in 2012 relating to the settlement of certain shareholder litigation (the ENHANCE Litigation&#8221;) (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by higher exchange losses in 2013 driven by $140 million of exchange losses related to a Venezuelan currency devaluation (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as higher interest expense in 2013 resulting in part from issuances of debt in September 2012 and May 2013. Other (income) expense, net was $1.1 billion of expense in 2012 compared with $946 million of expense in 2011 reflecting the $493 million net charge in 2012 relating to the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation and gains recognized in 2011 of $136 million on the disposition of the Company&#8217;s interest in the JJMCP joint venture (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and $127 million on the sale of certain manufacturing facilities and related assets (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by a $500 million charge in 2011 related to the resolution of the arbitration proceeding involving the Company&#8217;s rights to market Remicade &#32;and Simponi &#32;and higher interest income in 2012. \n\n##TABLE_START Segment Profits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPharmaceutical segment profits \n\n$ \n\n22,983 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,852 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,617 \n\nOther non-reportable segment profits \n\n3,094 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,163 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,995 \n\nOther \n\n(20,532 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(20,276 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(21,278 \n\n) \n\nIncome before income taxes \n\n$ \n\n5,545 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,739 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,334 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSegment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, certain operating expenses directly incurred by the segment, components of equity income or loss from affiliates and depreciation and amortization expenses. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate materials and production costs, other than standard costs, the majority of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. Also excluded from the determination of segment profits are the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and other acquisition-related costs, intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring costs, taxes paid at the joint venture level, a portion of equity income, other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. Additionally, segment profits do not reflect the charge related to the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation recorded in 2012, the arbitration settlement charge, the gain on the divestiture of the Company&#8217;s interest in the JJMCP joint venture and a gain on the sale of certain manufacturing facilities and related assets recorded in 2011. All of these unallocated items are reflected in &#8220;Other&#8221; in the above table. Also included in &#8220;Other&#8221; are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing sales, divested products or businesses, and other supply sales. \n\nPharmaceutical segment profits declined 11% in 2013 driven primarily by the effects of the loss of market exclusivity for certain products, particularly Singulair . Pharmaceutical segment profits increased 1% in 2012 driven primarily by lower operating expenses mostly offset by the effects of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for Singulair . \n\nTaxes on Income \n\nThe effective income tax rates of 18.5% in 2013, 27.9% in 2012 and 12.8% in 2011 reflect the impacts of acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs, partially offset by the beneficial impact of foreign earnings. The effective tax rate in 2013 reflects a net benefit of $165 million from the settlements of certain federal income tax issues, net benefits from reductions in tax reserves upon expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, the favorable impact of tax legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2013 that extended the R&#38;D tax credit for both 2012 and 2013, as well as an out-of-period net tax benefit of approximately $160 million associated with the resolution of a previously disclosed legacy Schering-Plough federal income tax issue (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects the favorable impacts of a tax settlement with the Canada Revenue Agency (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), the realization of foreign tax credits and the impact of a favorable ruling on a state tax matter. In addition, the 2012 effective tax rate reflects the unfavorable impact of the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation for which no tax benefit was recorded and does not reflect any impacts for the R&#38;D tax credit, which expired on December 31, 2011. As a result of legislation passed in 2013 that extended the R&#38;D tax credit, both the 2012 and 2013 R&#38;D tax credits were recognized in 2013 as noted above. The effective tax rate for 2011 reflects a net favorable impact of approximately $700 million relating to the settlement of Merck&#8217;s 2002-2005 federal income tax audit, the favorable impact of certain foreign and state tax rate changes that resulted in a net $270 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities on intangibles established in purchase accounting, and the unfavorable impact of a $500 million charge related to the resolution of the arbitration proceeding involving the Company&#8217;s rights to market Remicade &#32;and Simponi . \n\nNet Income and Earnings per Common Share \n\nNet income attributable to Merck &#38; Co., Inc. was $4.4 billion &#32;in 2013 , $6.2 billion &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $6.3 billion &#32;in 2011 . EPS was $1.47 &#32;in 2013 , $2.00 &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $2.02 &#32;in 2011 . The declines in net income and EPS in 2013 as compared with 2012 were due primarily to lower sales reflecting the loss of market exclusivity for certain products, particularly Singulair , as well as higher restructuring costs, intangible asset impairment charges and exchange losses, partially offset by the favorable impact of certain tax items and lower operating expenses. EPS in 2013 benefited from lower average shares outstanding due to the ASR program (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The decreases in net income and EPS in 2012 as compared with 2011 were due primarily to the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation, the effects of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for Singulair &#32;in 2012 and the favorable impact of tax items in 2011, partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses, lower restructuring costs and lower intangible asset impairment charges in 2012 and the arbitration settlement charge recorded in 2011. \n\nNon-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company&#8217;s performance used by management that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors&#8217; understanding of the Company&#8217;s results. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. The excluded items consist of acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. These excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, the information on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, net income and EPS prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). Additionally, since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics. Senior management&#8217;s annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS. \n\nA reconciliation between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions except per share amounts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPretax income as reported under GAAP \n\n$ \n\n5,545 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,739 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,334 \n\nIncrease (decrease) for excluded items: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisition-related costs \n\n5,549 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,344 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,939 \n\nRestructuring costs \n\n2,401 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,911 \n\nOther items: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet charge related to settlement of ENHANCE Litigation \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nArbitration settlement charge \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nGain on disposition of interest in JJMCP joint venture \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(136 \n\n) \n\nGain on sale of manufacturing facilities and related assets \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(127 \n\n) \n\nOther \n\n(13 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13,482 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,575 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,426 \n\nTaxes on income as reported under GAAP \n\n1,028 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,440 \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimated tax benefit on excluded items \n\n1,573 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,261 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,697 \n\nNet tax benefits from settlements of federal income tax issues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nTax benefit from foreign and state tax rate changes \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,926 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,609 \n\nNon-GAAP net income \n\n10,556 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,874 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,817 \n\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Merck &#38; Co., Inc. \n\n$ \n\n10,443 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,743 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,697 \n\nEPS assuming dilution as reported under GAAP \n\n$ \n\n1.47 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.02 \n\nEPS difference (1) \n\n2.02 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.82 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.75 \n\nNon-GAAP EPS assuming dilution \n\n$ \n\n3.49 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.82 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.77 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nRepresents the difference between calculated GAAP EPS and calculated non-GAAP EPS, which may be different than the amount calculated by dividing the impact of the excluded items by the weighted-average shares for the applicable year . \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nAcquisition-Related Costs \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up, as well as intangible asset impairment charges. Also excluded are incremental, third-party integration costs associated with the Merger, such as costs related to legal entity and system integration, as well as other costs associated with mergers and acquisitions, such as severance costs which are not part of the Company&#8217;s formal restructuring programs. These costs are excluded because management believes that these costs are not representative of ongoing normal business activities. \n\nRestructuring Costs \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). These amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the site, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. Restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs. The Company has undertaken restructurings of different types during the covered periods and, therefore, these charges should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS because it believes it is helpful for understanding the performance of the continuing business. \n\nCertain Other Items \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain other items. These items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature and generally represent items that, either as a result of their nature or magnitude, management would not anticipate that they would occur as part of the Company&#8217;s normal business on a regular basis. \n\nCertain other items are comprised of the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation, the arbitration settlement charge, the gain on the disposition of the Company&#8217;s interest in the JJMCP joint venture and the gain associated with the sale of certain manufacturing facilities and related assets. Also excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are tax benefits from the resolution of certain federal income tax issues. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nA chart reflecting the Company&#8217;s current research pipeline as of February 21, 2014 is set forth in Item 1. &#8220;Business &#160;&#8212; &#32;Research and Development&#8221; above. \n\nResearch and Development Update \n\nThe Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the United States or internationally. \n\nMK-5348, vorapaxar, is an investigational anti-thrombotic medicine under review by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (the &#8220;EMA&#8221;). Merck is seeking approval of vorapaxar for the reduction of atherothrombotic events, when added to standard of care, in patients with a history of heart attack and no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. In January 2014, the FDA&#8217;s Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee recommended approval of vorapaxar. The FDA is not bound by the committee&#8217;s guidance, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing investigational medicines. \n\nV503, the Company&#8217;s nine-valent HPV vaccine in development to help protect against certain HPV-related diseases, is under review by the FDA. V503 incorporates antigens against five additional cancer-causing HPV types as compared with Gardasil . The Company anticipates submitting a Marketing Authorization Application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;) to the EMA in the first half of 2014. \n\nMK-8962, corifollitropin alfa injection, is an investigational fertility treatment under review by the FDA for controlled ovarian stimulation in women participating in assisted reproductive technology. If approved, corifollitropin alfa would be the first sustained follicular stimulant for use in a fertility treatment regimen in the United States. Merck&#8217;s corifollitropin alfa is currently approved in more than 50 markets outside the United States, including the EU. \n\nMK-7243, &#32;Grastek , an investigational Timothy grass pollen allergy immunotherapy tablet (&#8220;AIT&#8221;), and MK-3641, Ragwitek , an investigational ragweed pollen AIT, are both under review by the FDA. MK-7243 and MK-3641 are investigational sublingual tablets designed to help treat the underlying cause of allergic rhinitis by generating an immune response to help protect allergic patients against effects triggered by the targeted allergen. Merck has partnered with ALK-Abello to develop its investigational sublingual allergy immunotherapy tablets for Timothy grass pollen, ragweed pollen and house dust mites in North America. In December 2013, the FDA&#8217;s Allergenic Products Advisory Committee had a positive discussion of MK-7243. In January 2014, the same Advisory Committee had a positive discussion of MK-3641. The FDA is not bound by the committee&#8217;s guidance, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing investigational medicines. Merck expects the FDA&#8217;s review for both MK-7243 and MK-3641 to be completed in the first half of 2014. In February 2014, the Company announced that Grastek &#32;received regulatory approval in Canada. \n\nMK-4305, suvorexant, is an investigational insomnia medicine in a new class of medicines called orexin receptor antagonists for use in patients with difficulty falling or staying asleep. In July 2013, the Company announced that it had received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for suvorexant. In the CRL, the FDA advised Merck that: (1) the efficacy of suvorexant has been established at doses of 10 mg to 40 mg in elderly and non-elderly adult patients; (2) 10 mg should be the starting dose for most patients and must be available before suvorexant can be approved; (3) 15 mg and 20 mg doses would be appropriate in patients in whom the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective; and (4), for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, a 5 mg dose would be necessary. In addition, the FDA determined that the safety data do not support the approval of suvorexant 30 mg and 40 mg. In February, 2014, the Company resubmitted its NDA to the FDA. As previously disclosed, both FDA approval and a separate scheduling determination by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are required before Merck can introduce suvorexant in the United States. Insomnia is a condition characterized by difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. The Company has submitted a new drug application for suvorexant to the health authorities in Japan and is continuing with plans to seek approval for suvorexant in other countries around the world. \n\nMK-8616, sugammadex sodium injection, is an investigational agent for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium (neuromuscular blocking agents). Neuromuscular blockade is used in anesthesiology to induce muscle relaxation during surgery. In September 2013, Merck announced that it had received a CRL from the FDA for the resubmission of the NDA for sugammadex sodium injection. The FDA&#8217;s letter raised concerns about operational aspects of a hypersensitivity study that the agency had requested in 2008. To address the CRL, the Company is conducting a hypersensitivity study and anticipates filing an NDA resubmission with the FDA in 2014. Sugammadex sodium injection is approved and has been launched in many countries outside of the United States where it is marketed as Bridion . \n\nMK-8109, vintafolide, is an investigational cancer candidate under review by the EMA. As part of an exclusive license agreement with Endocyte, Inc. (&#8220;Endocyte&#8221;), Merck is responsible for the development and worldwide commercialization of vintafolide in oncology. The EMA accepted the MAA filings for vintafolide and Endocyte&#8217;s investigational companion diagnostic imaging agent, etarfolatide, for the targeted treatment of patients with folate-receptor positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Both vintafolide and etarfolatide have been granted orphan drug status by the EC. Vintafolide is in Phase 3 development in the United States. \n\nMK-7009, vaniprevir, is an investigational, oral twice-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection under review in Japan. \n\nIn addition to the candidates under regulatory review, the Company has 12 drug candidates in Phase 3 development targeting a broad range of diseases. The Company anticipates filing an NDA or a BLA, as applicable, with the FDA with respect to several of these candidates in 2014. \n\nMK-3475, an investigational anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, is currently being evaluated for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma and other tumor types. In January 2014, the Company announced it has started a rolling submission to the FDA of a BLA for MK-3475 for patients with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with ipilimumab. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The Company expects to complete the application in the first half of 2014. In April 2013, Merck announced that MK-3475 received a Breakthrough Therapy designation for advanced melanoma from the FDA. The designation of an investigational drug as a Breakthrough Therapy is intended to expedite the development and review of a candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. \n\nThe MK-3475 clinical development program also includes studies across a broad range of cancer types including: bladder, colorectal, gastric, head and neck, melanoma, non-small cell lung, renal, triple negative breast and hematological malignancies. In addition, the Company has announced four collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to evaluate novel combination regimens with MK-3475. \n\nMK-0822, odanacatib, is an oral, once-weekly investigational treatment for patients with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease that reduces bone density and strength and results in an increased risk of bone fractures. Odanacatib is a cathepsin K inhibitor that selectively inhibits the cathepsin K enzyme. Cathepsin K is known to play a central role in the function of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down existing bone tissue, particularly the protein components of bone. Inhibition of cathepsin K is a novel approach to the treatment of osteoporosis. In July 2012, Merck announced an update on the Phase 3 trial assessing fracture risk reduction with odanacatib. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (the &#8220;DMC&#8221;) for the study completed its first planned interim analysis for efficacy and recommended that the study be closed early due to robust efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile. The DMC noted that safety issues remain in certain selected areas and made recommendations with respect to following up on them. On February 1, 2013, Merck announced that it had recently received and was reviewing safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 trial. As a result of its review of this data, the Company concluded that review of additional data from the previously planned, ongoing extension study was warranted and that filing an application for approval with the FDA should be delayed. As previously announced, the Company is conducting a blinded extension of the trial in approximately 8,200 women, which will provide additional safety and efficacy data. Merck continues to anticipate that it will file applications for approval of odanacatib in 2014 with additional data from the extension trial. The Company continues to believe that odanacatib will have the potential to address unmet medical needs in patients with osteoporosis. \n\nV419 is an investigational hexavalent pediatric combination vaccine, which contains components of current vaccines, designed to help protect against six potentially serious diseases &#8212; diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough ( Bordetella pertussis ), polio (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3), invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae &#32;type b, and hepatitis B &#8212; that is being developed in collaboration with Sanofi-Pasteur. The Company continues to anticipate filing a BLA for V419 with the FDA in 2014. \n\nMK-0859, anacetrapib, is an investigational inhibitor of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (&#8220;CETP&#8221;) that is being investigated in lipid management to raise HDL-C and reduce LDL-C. Anacetrapib is being evaluated in a large, event-driven cardiovascular clinical outcomes trial REVEAL (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification) involving patients with preexisting vascular disease that is predicted to be completed in 2017. \n\nMK-8931 is Merck&#8217;s novel investigational oral &#223;-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme (&#8220;BACE&#8221;) inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease being evaluated in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial (EPOCH) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-8931 versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Based on a positive DMC recommendation made following a planned analysis of interim safety data that included a safety cohort of 200 patients treated with MK-8931 for at least three months, the Company recently began enrolling patients in the Phase 3 portion of the trial, as well as a new Phase 3 trial (APECS) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-8931 versus placebo in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, also known as prodromal Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. \n\nMK-3415A, actoxumab/bezlotoxumab, an investigational candidate for the prevention of Clostridium difficile &#32;infection recurrence, is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies used to treat patients with a single infusion. \n\nMK-3102, omarigliptin, is an investigational once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. \n\nMK-8835, ertugliflozin, is an investigational oral sodium glucose cotransporter (&#8220;SGLT2&#8221;) inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. During 2013, the Company entered into a worldwide (except Japan) collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. (&#8220;Pfizer&#8221;) for the development and commercialization of ertugliflozin as discussed below. \n\nMK-1293 is an insulin glargine candidate for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In February 2014, the Company announced that it had expanded its collaboration with Samsung Bioepis to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-1293. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will collaborate on clinical development, regulatory filings and manufacturing. If approved, Merck will commercialize this candidate. \n\nV212 is an inactivated varicella zoster virus vaccine in development for the prevention of herpes zoster. The Company is conducting two Phase 3 trials, one in autologous hematopoietic cell transplant patients and the other in patients with solid tumor malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and hematological malignancies. \n\nMK-3222, tildrakizumab, is an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody candidate being investigated for the treatment of psoriasis. \n\nMK-5172/MK-8742, an all-oral combination regimen in Phase 2 development consisting of MK-5172, an investigational hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and MK-8742, an investigational hepatitis C virus NS5A replication complex inhibitor, was granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation in October 2013 by the FDA for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. MK-5172 and MK-8742 are being investigated in a broad clinical program that includes studies in patients with multiple hepatitis C virus genotypes who are treatment-na&#239;ve, treatment failures as well as other important hepatitis C virus subpopulations such as patients with cirrhosis and those co-infected with HIV. \n\nMK-8175A, NOMAC/E2, which is being marketed as Zoely &#32;in the EU, is an investigational oral contraceptive for use by women to prevent pregnancy. In November 2011, Merck received a CRL from the FDA for NOMAC/E2. Merck has made the decision to discontinue the Phase 3 clinical trial for NOMAC/E2 being conducted in the United States. This decision is not based on any new safety or efficacy findings. \n\nIn May 2013, the Company provided an update on the clinical program for preladenant, Merck&#8217;s investigational adenosine A2A receptor antagonist for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. An initial review of data \n\nfrom three separate Phase 3 trials did not provide evidence of efficacy for preladenant compared with placebo. Based on these results, Merck has taken steps to discontinue the extension phases of these studies and no longer plans to pursue regulatory filings for preladenant. The decision to discontinue these studies was not based on any safety finding. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $181 million in 2013 related to the discontinuation of the clinical development program for preladenant. \n\nThe Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company&#8217;s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company&#8217;s research and development resources on candidates the Company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. Further, Merck has moved to diversify its portfolio through a collaboration on the development of biosimilars, which have the potential to harness the market opportunity presented by biological medicine patent expiries by delivering high quality biosimilars to enhance access for patients worldwide. The Company is committed to making externally sourced programs a greater component of its pipeline strategy, with a renewed focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies. \n\nThe Company also reviews its pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing. The Company is evaluating certain late-stage clinical development and platform technology assets to determine their out-licensing or sale potential. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, infectious diseases, inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, insomnia, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis, respiratory diseases and women&#8217;s health. \n\nIn-Process Research and Development \n\nIn connection with mergers and acquisitions, the Company has recorded the fair value of incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. At December 31, 2013 , the balance of IPR&#38;D was $1.9 billion . Some of the more significant projects in late-stage development include vorapaxar, the Company&#8217;s BACE inhibitor, sugammadex sodium injection and the AIT programs discussed above. \n\nDuring 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , approximately $346 million , $78 million &#32;and $666 million , respectively, of IPR&#38;D projects received marketing approval in a major market and the Company began amortizing these assets based on their estimated useful lives. \n\nAll of the IPR&#38;D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&#38;D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company&#8217;s failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. Additionally, if certain of the IPR&#38;D programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not realize the future cash flows it has estimated and recorded as IPR&#38;D as of the acquisition date, and the Company may also not recover the research and development expenditures made since the acquisition to further develop such program. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company&#8217;s future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges and such charges could be material. \n\nDuring 2013, the Company recorded $279 million &#32;of IPR&#38;D impairment charges within Research and development &#32;expenses. Of this amount, $181 million &#32;related to the write-off of the intangible asset associated with preladenant as a result of the discontinuation of the clinical development program for this compound. In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges resulting from changes in cash flow assumptions for certain compounds, as well as for pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were subsequently deemed to have no alternative use in the period. During 2012, the Company recorded $200 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges primarily for pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were subsequently deemed to have no alternative use during the period. During 2011, the Company recorded $587 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges primarily for \n\npipeline programs that were abandoned and determined to have no alternative use, as well as for expected delays in the launch timing or changes in the cash flow assumptions for certain compounds. In addition, the impairment charges in 2011 related to pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were either deemed to have no alternative use during the period or were out-licensed to a third party for consideration that was less than the related asset&#8217;s carrying value. \n\nAdditional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for approval. As of December 31, 2013 , the estimated costs to complete projects acquired in connection with mergers and acquisitions in Phase 3 development for human health and the analogous stage of development for animal health were approximately $1.2 billion. \n\nAcquisitions, Divestitures, Research Collaborations and License Agreements \n\nMerck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. During 2013, the Company completed transactions across a broad range of therapeutic categories. Merck is actively monitoring the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company&#8217;s strategic criteria. \n\nIn April 2013, Merck and Pfizer announced that they had entered into a worldwide (except Japan) collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of Pfizer&#8217;s ertugliflozin, an investigational oral sodium glucose cotransporter (&#8220;SGLT2&#8221;) inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Company has initiated Phase 3 clinical trials for ertugliflozin with Pfizer. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck and Pfizer will collaborate on the clinical development and commercialization of ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin-containing fixed-dose combinations with metformin and with Januvia &#32;(sitagliptin) tablets. Merck will continue to retain the rights to its existing portfolio of sitagliptin-containing products. Through the end of 2013, Merck recorded research and development expenses of $125 million for upfront and milestone payments made to Pfizer. Pfizer will be eligible for additional payments associated with the achievement of pre-specified future clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. The companies will share potential revenues and certain costs 60% to Merck and 40% to Pfizer. Each party will have certain manufacturing and supply obligations. The Company and Pfizer each have the right to terminate the agreement due to a material, uncured breach by, or insolvency of, the other party, or in the event of a safety issue. Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement upon 12 months notice at any time following the first anniversary of the first commercial sale of a collaboration product, but must assign all rights to ertugliflozin to Merck. Upon termination of the agreement, depending upon the circumstances, the parties have varying rights and obligations with respect to the continued development and commercialization of ertugliflozin and certain payment obligations. \n\nIn September 2013, Merck and AstraZeneca announced a worldwide out-licensing agreement for Merck&#8217;s oral small molecule inhibitor of WEE1 kinase (MK-1775). MK-1775 is currently being evaluated in Phase 2a clinical studies in combination with standard-of-care therapies for the treatment of patients with certain types of ovarian cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca paid Merck a $50 million upfront fee, which the Company recorded as revenue. In addition, Merck will be eligible to receive future payments tied to development and regulatory milestones, plus sales-related payments and tiered royalties. AstraZeneca will be responsible for all future clinical development, manufacturing and marketing. \n\nIn January 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. subsidiary and related RNAi technology assets to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Alnylam&#8221;). Under the terms of the agreement, the consideration to be paid by Alnylam to Merck will consist of $25 million in cash and 2,520,044 shares of Alnylam common stock (valued at approximately $165 million at the time of the agreement). In addition, Merck is eligible to receive up to $115 million in developmental and sales milestone payments, as well as single-digit royalties associated with certain preclinical candidates. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2014. \n\nSelected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information \n\nTo expand its research base and realize synergies from combining capabilities, opportunities and assets, in previous years Merck has formed a number of joint ventures. \n\nAstraZeneca LP \n\nIn 1982, Merck entered into an agreement with Astra AB (&#8220;Astra&#8221;) to develop and market Astra products under a royalty-bearing license. In 1993, Merck&#8217;s total sales of Astra products reached a level that triggered the first step in the establishment of a joint venture business carried on by Astra Merck Inc. (&#8220;AMI&#8221;), in which Merck and Astra each owned a 50% share. This joint venture, formed in 1994, developed and marketed most of Astra&#8217;s new prescription medicines in the United States including Prilosec, the first of a class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors, which slows the production of acid from the cells of the stomach lining. \n\nIn 1998, Merck and Astra completed the restructuring of the ownership and operations of the joint venture whereby Merck acquired Astra&#8217;s interest in AMI, renamed KBI Inc. (&#8220;KBI&#8221;), and contributed KBI&#8217;s operating assets to a new U.S. limited partnership, Astra Pharmaceuticals L.P. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), in exchange for a 1% limited partner interest. Astra contributed the net assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, Astra USA, Inc., to the Partnership in exchange for a 99% general partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP (&#8220;AZLP&#8221;) upon Astra&#8217;s 1999 merger with Zeneca Group Plc, became the exclusive distributor of the products for which KBI retained rights. \n\nWhile maintaining a 1% limited partner interest in AZLP, Merck has consent and protective rights intended to preserve its business and economic interests, including restrictions on the power of the general partner to make certain distributions or dispositions. Furthermore, in limited events of default, additional rights will be granted to the Company, including powers to direct the actions of, or remove and replace, the Partnership&#8217;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Merck earns ongoing revenue based on sales of KBI products and such revenue was $920 million , $915 million &#32;and 1.2 billion &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively, primarily relating to sales of Nexium, as well as Prilosec. In addition, Merck earns certain Partnership returns which are recorded in Equity income from affiliates. &#32;Such returns include a priority return provided for in the Partnership Agreement, a preferential return representing Merck&#8217;s share of undistributed AZLP GAAP earnings, and a variable return related to the Company&#8217;s 1% limited partner interest. These returns aggregated $352 million , $621 million &#32;and $574 million &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. \n\nIn 2014, AstraZeneca has the option to purchase Merck&#8217;s interest in KBI based in part on the value of Merck&#8217;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec. AstraZeneca&#8217;s option is exercisable between March 1, 2014 and April 30, 2014. If AstraZeneca chooses to exercise this option, the closing date is expected to be June 30, 2014. Under the amended agreement, AstraZeneca will make a payment to Merck upon closing of $327 million, reflecting an estimate of the fair value of Merck&#8217;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec. This portion of the exercise price is subject to a true-up in 2018 based on actual sales from closing in 2014 to June 2018. The exercise price will also include an additional amount equal to a multiple of ten times Merck&#8217;s average 1% annual profit allocation in the partnership for the three years prior to exercise. The Company believes that it is likely that AstraZeneca will exercise its option in 2014. If AstraZeneca exercises its option, the Company will no longer record equity income from AZLP and supply sales to AZLP will terminate. In addition, the Company will recognize a non-cash pretax gain of approximately $700 million. \n\nSanofi Pasteur MSD \n\nIn 1994, Merck and Pasteur M&#233;rieux Connaught (now Sanofi Pasteur S.A.) established an equally-owned joint venture to market vaccines in Europe and to collaborate in the development of combination vaccines for distribution in Europe. \n\nSales of joint venture products were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGardasil \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nInfluenza vaccines \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther viral vaccines \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nZostavax \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nRotaTeq \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHepatitis vaccines \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther vaccines \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,164 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,084 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,110 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nJohnson &#38; Johnson&#176;Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Company \n\nIn 2011, Merck sold its 50% interest in the JJMCP joint venture to J&#38;J. The venture between Merck and J&#38;J was formed in 1989 to develop, manufacture, market and distribute certain over-the-counter consumer products in the United States and Canada. Merck received a one-time payment of $175 million and recognized a pretax gain of $136 million in 2011 reflected in Other (income) expense, net . The partnership assets also included a manufacturing facility. Sales of products marketed by the joint venture were $62 million for the period from January 1, 2011 until the September 29, 2011 divestiture date. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nCapital expenditures were $1.5 billion &#32;in 2013 , $2.0 billion &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $1.7 billion &#32;in 2011 . Expenditures in the United States were $902 million in 2013, $1.3 billion in 2012 and $1.2 billion in 2011. \n\nDepreciation expense was $2.2 billion in 2013 , $2.0 billion in 2012 &#32;and $2.4 billion in 2011 &#32;of which $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, applied to locations in the United States. Total depreciation expense in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;included accelerated depreciation of $577 million , $235 million &#32;and $589 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). \n\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nMerck&#8217;s strong financial profile enables it to fully fund research and development, focus on external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders. \n\n##TABLE_START Selected Data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWorking capital \n\n$ \n\n17,817 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,936 \n\nTotal debt to total liabilities and equity \n\n23.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n19.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n16.7 \n\n% \n\nCash provided by operations to total debt \n\n0.5:1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5:1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7:1 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $11.7 billion &#32;in 2013 , $10.0 billion &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $12.4 billion &#32;in 2011 . Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 includes a payment made by the Company of $480 million in connection with the previously disclosed settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects higher contributions to its defined benefit plans as compared with 2013 and 2011. Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 also includes a payment of $960 million related to the resolution of certain litigation related to Vioxx . Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 includes a $500 million payment made to J&#38;J as a result of the arbitration settlement, as well as net payments of approximately $465 million to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of the conclusion of its examination of certain of Merck&#8217;s federal income tax returns. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the Company&#8217;s primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders. Global economic conditions and ongoing sovereign debt issues, among other factors, have adversely affected foreign receivables in certain European countries (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company received significant collections during 2013 and 2012, and has been successful in completing factoring arrangements for a portion of these receivables. Additionally, the Company continues to expand in the emerging markets where payment terms tend to be longer. The conditions in the EU and the emerging markets have resulted in an increase \n\nin the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding thereby adversely affecting cash provided by operating activities. \n\nCash used in investing activities was $3.1 billion in 2013 compared with $6.8 billion in 2012 primarily reflecting higher proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher purchases of securities and other investments. Cash used in investing activities was $6.8 billion in 2012 compared with $2.9 billion in 2011 primarily reflecting higher purchases of securities and other investments, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments. \n\nCash used in financing activities was $6.0 billion in 2013 compared with $3.3 billion in 2012. The higher use of cash in financing activities was driven primarily by higher purchases of treasury stock (largely under an ASR agreement as discussed below), as well as higher payments on debt and a decrease in short-term borrowings, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of debt. Cash used in financing activities in 2012 was $3.3 billion compared with $6.9 billion in 2011. The lower use of cash in financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of debt, lower payments on debt and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by increased purchases of treasury stock, a decrease in short-term borrowings and higher dividends paid to stockholders. \n\nAt December 31, 2013 , the total of worldwide cash and investments was $27.3 billion , including $17.5 billion &#32;of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $9.8 billion &#32;of long-term investments. Generally 80%-90% of these cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to significant tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated in the form of dividends. The Company records U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States, no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided. The amount of cash and investments held by U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates due to a variety of factors including the timing and receipt of payments in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the United States continues to be the Company&#8217;s primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, a portion of treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 &#32;are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n($ in millions) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2015&#8212;2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017&#8212;2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\nPurchase obligations (1) \n\n$ \n\n2,948 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nLoans payable and current portion of long-term debt \n\n4,492 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,492 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLong-term debt \n\n20,086 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,374 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,043 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,669 \n\nInterest related to debt obligations \n\n10,052 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,342 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,690 \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOperating leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,535 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,413 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,847 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,839 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,436 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nIncludes future bulk supply purchases the Company has committed to in connection with certain divestitures, including the disposition of its API manufacturing business in 2013 discussed above. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties of $4.2 billion, including $59 million &#32;reflected as a current liability. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement for years beyond 2014 &#32;cannot be made. \n\n##TABLE_END Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. Amounts reflected for research and development obligations do not include contingent milestone payments. Also excluded from research and development obligations are potential future funding commitments of up to approximately $100 million for investments in research venture capital funds. Loans payable and current portion of long-term debt reflects $370 million &#32;of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders. Required funding obligations for 2014 &#32;relating to the Company&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. However, the Company currently anticipates contributing approximately $250 million &#32;and $75 million , respectively, to its pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans during 2014 . \n\nThe Company has a $4.0 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in May 2017. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company&#8217;s commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility. \n\nIn May 2013, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $6.5 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.70% notes due in 2016, $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2016, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.30% notes due in 2018, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in 2018, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.80% notes due in 2023 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.15% notes due in 2043. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. The notes of each series are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the Company&#8217;s option at varying redemption prices. A substantial portion of the net proceeds from the notes were used to repurchase the Company&#8217;s common stock pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement in May 2013 as discussed below. \n\nIn December 2012, the Company filed a securities registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) under the automatic shelf registration process available to &#8220;well-known seasoned issuers&#8221; which is effective for three years. \n\nEffective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp. (&#8220;MSD&#8221;) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s are A1 with a stable outlook and AA with a stable outlook, respectively. These ratings continue to allow access to the capital markets and flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. The Company continues to maintain a conservative financial profile. The Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Despite this strong financial profile, certain contingent events, if realized, which are discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s liquidity and capital resources. The Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the Company to unrecorded financial obligations. \n\nIn November 2013, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share on the Company&#8217;s common stock payable in January 2014. \n\nOn May 1, 2013, the Company announced that its board of directors authorized additional purchases of up to $15 billion of Merck&#8217;s common stock for its treasury. The Company expects to repurchase approximately $7.5 billion of common stock within 12 months following the date of the announcement, financed through a combination of debt issuance and operating cash flows, with the remainder to be repurchased over time with no time limit. Purchases may be made in open-market transactions, block transactions, on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company purchased $6.5 billion &#32;of its common stock ( 139 million &#32;shares) for its treasury during 2013, which includes shares under an ASR agreement discussed below. The Company has approximately $10.4 billion remaining under the May share repurchase program. The Company purchased $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion of its common stock during 2012 and 2011, respectively, under previously authorized share repurchase programs. \n\nOn May 20, 2013, Merck entered into an ASR agreement with Goldman Sachs. Under the ASR, Merck agreed to purchase $5.0 billion of Merck&#8217;s common stock, in total, with an initial delivery of approximately 99.5 million shares of Merck&#8217;s common stock, based on current market price, made by Goldman Sachs to Merck, and payment of $5.0 billion made by Merck to Goldman Sachs, on May 21, 2013. Upon settlement of the ASR on October 31, 2013, Merck received an additional 5.5 million shares as determined by the average daily volume weighted-average price of Merck&#8217;s common stock during the term of the ASR program bringing the total shares received by Merck under this program to 105 million. The ASR was entered into pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on May 1, 2013. \n\nFinancial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures \n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments. \n\nA significant portion of the Company&#8217;s revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives and accounting related to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below. \n\nForeign Currency Risk Management \n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates. \n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the potential for longer-term unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates to decrease the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than three years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales. The portion of sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The hedged anticipated sales are a specified component of a portfolio of similarly denominated foreign currency-based sales transactions, each of which responds to the hedged currency risk in the same manner. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, which provide the Company with a right, but not an obligation, to sell foreign currencies in the future at a predetermined price. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, total changes in the options&#8217; cash flows offset the decline in the expected future U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the options&#8217; value reduces to zero, but the Company benefits from the increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows. \n\nIn connection with the Company&#8217;s revenue hedging program, a purchased collar option strategy may be utilized. With a purchased collar option strategy, the Company writes a local currency call option and purchases a local currency put option. As compared to a purchased put option strategy alone, a purchased collar strategy reduces the upfront costs associated with purchasing puts through the collection of premium by writing call options. If the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the purchased put option value of the collar strategy reduces to zero and the Company benefits from the increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its anticipated foreign currency cash flows, however this benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the written call option value of the collar strategy reduces to zero and the changes in the purchased put cash flows of the collar strategy would offset the decline in the expected future U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. \n\nThe Company may also utilize forward contracts in its revenue hedging program. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the increase in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the decrease in the expected future U.S. dollar cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the increase in the value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows. While a weaker U.S. dollar would result in a net benefit, the market value of Merck&#8217;s hedges would have declined by an estimated $547 million and $453 million at December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 , respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Because Merck principally uses purchased local currency put options, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these options. The sensitivity measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck&#8217;s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nThe primary objective of the balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets of foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. In these instances, Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts, which enable the Company to buy and sell foreign currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates and economically offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange from the monetary assets. Merck routinely enters into contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. For exposures in developing country currencies, the Company will enter into forward contracts to partially offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The Company will also minimize the effect of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities by managing operating activities and net asset positions at the local level. \n\nA sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2013, Income before taxes &#32;would have declined by approximately $109 million in 2013. Because the Company was in a net long position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform strengthening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. At December 31, 2012, the Company was in a net short position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, therefore a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced Income before taxes &#32;by approximately $20 million. This measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck&#8217;s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nIn February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency (Bol&#237;var Fuertes) from 4.30 VEF per U.S. dollar to 6.30 VEF per U.S. dollar. The Company recognized losses due to exchange of approximately $140 million in 2013 resulting from the remeasurement of the local monetary assets and liabilities at the new rate. Since January 2010, Venezuela has been designated hyperinflationary and, as a result, local foreign operations are remeasured in U.S. dollars with the impact recorded in results of operations. \n\nIn March 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the creation of a new foreign exchange mechanism called the &#8220;Complimentary System of Foreign Currency Acquirement&#8221; (known as SICAD) that operates similar to an auction system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for U.S. dollars to be used for specified import transactions. In December 2013, the regulation that created the SICAD auction mechanism was amended to require the Central Bank of Venezuela to include on its website the weekly average exchange rate implied by transactions settled via the SICAD auction mechanism, which for the week of December 30, 2013, was 11.3 BsF per U.S. dollar. The Company has not used the SICAD auction mechanism to settle any transactions. While the SICAD mechanism is described as an auction, it has several attributes that are inconsistent with a free market auction. Accordingly, the Company does not believe it is appropriate to use the SICAD rate for remeasurement under U.S. GAAP. The Company will continue to monitor the SICAD auction mechanism. It is possible that circumstances may change such that the SICAD mechanism takes on the attributes of a true free market auction and the SICAD rate can be utilized for remeasurement purposes. If this occurs, or if a devaluation of the official rate occurs, it could result in a material charge to the Company&#8217;s future results of operations. \n\nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The Company hedges a portion of the net investment in certain of its foreign operations and measures ineffectiveness based upon changes in spot foreign exchange rates. The effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within Other Comprehensive &#32; Income &#32;(&#8220; OCI &#8221;), and remains in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income &#32;(&#8220; AOCI&#8221;) &#32;until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. The Company&#8217;s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment \n\nin a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI . \n\nInterest Rate Risk Management \n\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk. \n\nDuring 2013, the Company entered into 15 pay-floating, received-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes. There are four swaps maturing in 2016 with notional amounts of $250 million each that effectively convert the Company&#8217;s 0.70% fixed-rate notes due in 2016 to floating-rate instruments; four swaps maturing in 2018 with notional amounts of $250 million each that effectively convert the Company&#8217;s 1.30% fixed-rate notes due in 2018 to floating-rate instruments; four swaps maturing in 2017, one with a notional amount of $200 million, two with notional amounts of $250 million each, and one with a notional amount of $300 million, that effectively convert the Company&#8217;s 6.00% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 to floating-rate instruments; and three swaps maturing in 2019, two with notional amounts of $200 million each, and one with a notional amount of $150 million, that effectively convert a portion of the Company&#8217;s 5.00% notes due in 2019 to floating rate instruments. The interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the LIBOR are recorded in interest expense and offset by the fair value changes in the swap contracts. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nThere were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2012. During 2011, the Company terminated pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes. These swaps effectively converted certain of its fixed-rate notes to floating-rate instruments. The interest rate swap contracts were designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark LIBOR swap rate. As a result of the swap terminations, the Company received $288 million in cash, which included $43 million in accrued interest. The corresponding $245 million basis adjustment of the debt associated with the terminated interest rate swap contracts was deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the respective term of the notes. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company&#8217;s medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company&#8217;s fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of Merck&#8217;s investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The fair value of Merck&#8217;s debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of Merck&#8217;s investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nThe Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities, primarily IPR&#38;D and other intangible assets, as well as subsequent fair value measurement. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent \n\nin such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements. \n\nMergers and Acquisitions \n\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the merger or acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. If the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company&#8217;s intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements after the date of the merger or acquisition. If the Company determines the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&#38;D, are determined utilizing information available near the merger or acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&#38;D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project, Merck will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset and begin amortization. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an &#8220;income approach&#8221; through which fair value is estimated based on each asset&#8217;s discounted projected net cash flows. The Company&#8217;s estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the Company&#8217;s competitors; and the life of each asset&#8217;s underlying patent, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate. \n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&#38;D are determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset&#8217;s probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenues from sales of products are recognized at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss passes to the customer. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds and completion of all performance obligations. Domestically, sales discounts are issued to customers as direct discounts at the point-of-sale or indirectly through an intermediary wholesaler, known as chargebacks, or indirectly in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, revenues are \n\nrecorded net of time value of money discounts for customers for which collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year. \n\nThe provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases directly through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product at its contracted price plus a mark-up from the wholesaler. The wholesaler, in turn, charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company&#8217;s wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. The provision is based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage and contract performance by the benefit provider customers. \n\nThe Company uses historical customer segment mix, adjusted for other known events, in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate indirect customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other customers to the amounts accrued. Adjustments are recorded when trends or significant events indicate that a change in the estimated provision is appropriate. \n\nThe Company continually monitors its provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts. There were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate indirect customer discount provision in 2013 , 2012 &#32;or 2011 . \n\nSummarized information about changes in the aggregate indirect customer discount accrual is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance January 1 \n\n$ \n\n1,873 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,824 \n\nCurrent provision \n\n5,451 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,694 \n\nAdjustments to prior years \n\n(70 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments \n\n(5,566 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,734 \n\n) \n\nBalance December 31 \n\n$ \n\n1,688 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,873 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAccruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued balances relative to these provisions included in Accounts receivable &#32;and Accrued and other current liabilities &#32;were $87 million &#32;and $1.6 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2013 &#32;and were $120 million &#32;and $1.8 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2012 . \n\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns provision for U.S. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of U.S. net pharmaceutical sales was 1.5% in 2013 , 1.4% in 2012 &#32;and 1.3% in 2011 . \n\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns. \n\nWholesalers generally provide only the above mentioned data to the Company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. Given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the Company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns. \n\nInventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches \n\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in Phase 3 clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. The Company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the Company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;were $177 million &#32;and $196 million , respectively. \n\nContingencies and Environmental Liabilities \n\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as additional matters such as antitrust actions (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.) The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. \n\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company&#8217;s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;of approximately $160 million &#32;and $260 million , respectively, represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined. \n\nThe Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and providing for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually. \n\nThe Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Expenditures for remediation and \n\nenvironmental liabilities were $20 million in 2013 , and are estimated at $117 million in the aggregate for the years 2014 &#32;through 2018 . In management&#8217;s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $213 million &#32;and $145 million &#32;at December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 , respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $84 million &#32;in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. Total pretax share-based compensation expense was $276 million &#32;in 2013 , $335 million &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $369 million &#32;in 2011 . At December 31, 2013 , there was $374 million &#32;of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. For segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses. \n\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nNet periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $716 million &#32;in 2013 , $509 million &#32;in 2012 &#32;and $665 million &#32;in 2011 . Pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. \n\nThe Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. At December 31, 2013 , the discount rates for the Company&#8217;s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 3.60% to 5.20% compared with a range of 3.00% to 4.20% at December 31, 2012 . \n\nThe expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data as well as actual returns on the Company&#8217;s plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. As a result of this analysis, for 2014 , the Company&#8217;s expected rate of return will range from 7.30% &#32;to 8.75% &#32;compared to a range of 6.00% &#32;to 8.75% &#32;in 2013 &#32;for its U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans. \n\nThe Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company&#8217;s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated 40% &#32;to 60% &#32;in U.S. equities, 20% &#32;to 40% &#32;in international equities, 15% &#32;to 25% &#32;in fixed-income investments, and up to 5% &#32;in cash and other investments. The portfolio&#8217;s equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans&#8217; benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 13% , reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines. \n\nActuarial assumptions are based upon management&#8217;s best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $87 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on its net periodic benefit cost. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $39 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on its net periodic benefit cost. Required funding obligations for 2014 &#32;relating to the Company&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. The preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the Company&#8217;s funding requirements. \n\nNet loss amounts, which reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of AOCI . Expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the Company&#8217;s expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Also, net loss amounts in AOCI &#32;in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. \n\nRestructuring Costs \n\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring programs designed to reduce the cost structure, increase efficiency and enhance competitiveness. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. When accruing these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. In connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. Severance and other related costs are reflected within Restructuring costs . Asset-related charges are reflected within Materials and production &#32;costs, Marketing and administrative &#32;expenses and Research and development &#32;expenses depending upon the nature of the asset. \n\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets \n\nThe Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company&#8217;s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nThe Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset&#8217;s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach. \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company&#8217;s share price. Additionally, the Company evaluates the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the last date a valuation was performed. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. \n\nOther acquired intangibles (excluding IPR&#38;D) are recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or circumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that \n\nthe carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows. \n\nIPR&#38;D represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects that the Company acquires through business combinations which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the project. The Company tests IPR&#38;D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&#38;D intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&#38;D intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. For impairment testing purposes, the Company may combine separately recorded IPR&#38;D intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the Company will combine IPR&#38;D intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized within the Company&#8217;s operating results. \n\nImpairments of Investments \n\nThe Company reviews its investments for impairments based on the determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The Company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investments, including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost and, for equity securities, the Company&#8217;s ability and intent to hold the investments. For debt securities, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. The remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in OCI . \n\nTaxes on Income \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company&#8217;s quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company&#8217;s quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company&#8217;s tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management&#8217;s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.) \n\nTax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements. At December 31, 2013 , foreign earnings of $57.1 billion &#32;have been retained indefinitely by subsidiary companies for reinvestment; therefore, no provision has been made for income \n\ntaxes that would be payable upon the distribution of such earnings and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability. \n\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results \n\nThis report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called &#8220;forward-looking statements,&#8221; all of which are based on management&#8217;s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects&#8221; and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company&#8217;s growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product potential and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company&#8217;s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. \n\nThe Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the Company&#8217;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on this Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and 8-K. In Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this annual report on Form 10-K the Company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 376, "Negative": 668, "Polarity": -0.27969348632213265, "Subjectivity": 0.0732785849601124}, "similarity_score": 0.9478664313049496, "nlp_result": 0}
