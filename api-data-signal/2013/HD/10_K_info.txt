Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nExecutive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data \n\nFor the fiscal year ended February 2, 2014 &#32;(\"fiscal 2013 \"), we reported Net Earnings of $ 5.4 billion &#32;and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 3.76 &#32;compared to Net Earnings of $ 4.5 billion &#32;and Diluted Earnings per Share of $ 3.00 &#32;for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2013 &#32;(\"fiscal 2012 \"). The results for fiscal 2012 included a total charge of $145 million, net of tax, related to the closing of our remaining seven big box stores in China (\"China store closings\") in fiscal 2012, which had a negative impact of $0.10 to Diluted Earnings per Share. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Net Earnings were $4.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. \n\nNet Sales increased 5.4% &#32;to $ 78.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;from $ 74.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Our comparable store sales increased 6.8% &#32;in fiscal 2013 , driven by increased comparable store customer transactions and comparable store average ticket. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 7.5% in fiscal 2013 . \n\nFiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks for fiscal 2012. The 53 rd &#32;week added approximately $1.2 billion in Net Sales and increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. \n\nIn fiscal 2013 , we continued to focus on the following key initiatives: \n\nCustomer Service &#32;&#8211; Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. In fiscal 2013 , we met our goal of dedicating 60% of store labor hours to customer-facing activity, and we enhanced our Customer FIRST training for associates to incorporate the interconnected retail experience. We also expanded our FIRST phones' functionality to process Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (\"BOPIS\") and Buy Online, Ship to Store (\"BOSS\") orders, allowing our associates to close these types of transactions immediately from wherever they are in the store. Also in fiscal 2013, we introduced Pro Xtra, a new loyalty program that provides our professional customers with discounts on useful business services, exclusive product offers and streamlined payment and receipt tracking tools. \n\nProduct Authority &#32;&#8211; Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering product innovation, assortment and value. As part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for our professional, do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments. Also in fiscal 2013, we continued our appliance showroom resets and expanded our assortment of appliances available online, resulting in double digit growth for appliances for fiscal 2013. \n\nDisciplined Capital Allocation, Productivity and Efficiency &#32;&#8211; Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal 2013 , we continued to make improvements to our forecasting and replenishment systems, helping our business to react to and recover from sales spikes while keeping inventory under control. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.6 times at the end of fiscal 2013 compared to 4.5 times at the end of fiscal 2012. \n\nWe repurchased a total of 111 million &#32;shares for $8.5 billion &#32;through Accelerated Share Repurchase agreements and the open market during fiscal 2013 . In addition, in February 2014, we announced a 21% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.47 per share. \n\nInterconnected Retail &#32;&#8211; Our focus on interconnected retail, which connects our other three key initiatives, is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. In fiscal 2013, we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience resulting in improved customer satisfaction scores and online sales conversion rates. Sales from our online channels increased over 50% for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and now represent approximately 3.5% of our total Net Sales. We have also begun the development of three new direct fulfillment centers, the first of which opened in February 2014. Each facility will have the capacity to hold approximately 100,000 product offerings available to be shipped directly to customers, along with the capability to ship most orders the same day they are received. \n\nIn January 2014, we acquired Blinds.com, an online seller of window coverings. We believe that this acquisition will allow us to offer customers a compelling shopping, sales and service experience for online window coverings purchases and help us to develop best-in-class capabilities for selling customizable and configurable products online. \n\nIn fiscal 2013 , we opened eight &#32;new stores, including six &#32;new stores in Mexico and two &#32;new stores in the U.S., and closed one store in the U.S., for a total store count of 2,263 &#32;at the end of fiscal 2013 . As of the end of fiscal 2013 , a total of 286 &#32;of our stores, or 12.6% , were located in Canada and Mexico. \n\n&#32;17 \n\nWe generated $7.6 billion &#32;of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 . This cash flow, along with $4.0 billion of incremental long-term debt issued in fiscal 2013 and cash on hand, was used to fund $8.5 billion &#32;of share repurchases, pay $2.2 billion &#32;of dividends and fund $1.4 billion &#32;in capital expenditures. \n\nOur return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 20.9% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to 17.0% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . \n\n&#32;18 \n\nWe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n% of Net Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n% Increase (Decrease) \n\nIn Dollar Amounts \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 vs. 2011 \n\nNET SALES \n\n100.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\nGROSS PROFIT \n\n34.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n34.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n34.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n6.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n6.5 \n\nOperating Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\n21.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n22.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n22.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\nDepreciation and Amortization \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\nTotal Operating Expenses \n\n23.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n24.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n25.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\nOPERATING INCOME \n\n11.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n9.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n18.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n16.6 \n\nInterest and Other (Income) Expense: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and Investment Income \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(40.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n53.8 \n\nInterest Expense \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\nOther \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(100.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n28.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(8.1 \n\n) \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION \n\nFOR INCOME TAXES \n\n10.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n9.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n17.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n19.0 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n3.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n22.9 \n\nNET EARNINGS \n\n6.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n18.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n16.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\nSELECTED SALES DATA \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2) \n\n1,390.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,364.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,317.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nAverage Ticket (2) \n\n$ \n\n56.78 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n54.89 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n53.28 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\nSales per Square Foot (2) \n\n$ \n\n334.35 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n318.63 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n299.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\nComparable Store Sales Increase (%) (3) \n\n6.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\nOnline Sales (% of Net Sales) (4) \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n52.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n39.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNote: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. &#160; \n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nFiscal years 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;refer to the fiscal years ended February 2, 2014 , February 3, 2013 &#32;and January 29, 2012 , respectively.

Net Sales for fiscal 2013 &#32; increased &#32; 5.4% &#32;to $78.8 billion &#32;from $74.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The increase &#32;in Net Sales for fiscal 2013 &#32;reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013, partially offset by $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 6.8% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to an increase of 4.6% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . \n\nThe positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 &#32;reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our core categories and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2013 . Comparable store sales for our Kitchen, Electrical, Lumber, Plumbing, Lighting, Bath and Indoor Garden product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2013 . Comparable store sales for our Tools, Paint, Flooring, D&#233;cor, Hardware, Outdoor Garden, Millwork and Building Materials product categories were positive for fiscal 2013 . Further, our comparable store customer transactions increased approximately 3.4% for fiscal 2013 and comparable store average ticket increased approximately 3.3% for fiscal 2013 &#32;due in part to strong sales in our appliance business and continued recovery in sales to our professional customers. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross Profit increased &#32; 6.0% &#32;to $27.4 billion &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;from $25.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the China store closings. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.8% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to 34.6% &#32;for fiscal 2012 , an increase &#32;of 18 basis points. The increase &#32;in gross profit margin in fiscal 2013 &#32;was driven primarily by businesses we acquired in fiscal 2012, which are gross margin accretive, higher productivity in our supply chain and improved shrink performance, partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses (\"SG&#38;A\") increased &#32; 0.5% &#32;to $16.6 billion &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;from $16.5 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . SG&#38;A for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#38;A was 21.1% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to 22.1% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The decrease &#32;in SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2013 &#32;reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion &#32;for both fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 . Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% &#32;for both fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 . \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating Income increased &#32; 18.0% &#32;to $9.2 billion &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;from $7.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 11.6% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to 10.4% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nIn fiscal 2013 , we recognized $699 million &#32;of Interest and Other, net, compared to $545 million &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to 0.7% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The increase &#32;in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2013 reflects increased interest expense associated with the issuance of $4.0 billion of incremental long-term debt in fiscal 2013. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to 37.2% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2013 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million charge related to the China store closings for fiscal 2012. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. \n\n&#32;20 \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share were $3.76 &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to $3.00 &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012 . The 53 rd &#32;week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. \n\nNon-GAAP Measures \n\nTo provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting to exclude from some GAAP measures certain items that we do not consider to be representative of our actual operating performance. These financial calculations are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined in SEC rules. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. \n\nThe results for fiscal 2012 included a $145 million charge, net of tax, related to the China store closings as described more fully in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no adjustments for fiscal 2013 or 2011 for events of unusual nature or frequency. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2012 (amounts in millions, except per share data): &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nAs \n\nReported \n\n&#160; \n\nAdjustments \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-GAAP \n\nMeasures \n\n&#160; \n\n% of \n\nNet Sales \n\nGross Profit \n\n$ \n\n25,842 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,852 \n\n&#160; \n\n34.6 \n\n% \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\n16,508 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16,373 \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\nOperating Income \n\n7,766 \n\n&#160; \n\n(145 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n7,911 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.6 \n\nNet Earnings \n\n4,535 \n\n&#160; \n\n(145 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n4,680 \n\n&#160; \n\n6.3 \n\n% \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share \n\n$ \n\n3.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.10 \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2012 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nNet Sales \n\nFiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2011. Net Sales for fiscal 2012 increased 6.2% to $74.8 billion from $70.4 billion for fiscal 2011. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and $1.2 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2012. Total comparable store sales increased 4.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 3.4% for fiscal 2011. \n\nThe positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved U.S. housing market. All of our departments except for one posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2012, and comparable store average ticket increased 2.9% for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Tools, Bath, Electrical, Lighting, Indoor Garden and D&#233;cor product categories were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Hardware, Plumbing, Outdoor Garden, Kitchen and Millwork product categories were positive for fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales for our Building Materials product category were negative for fiscal 2012, reflecting the impact of weather and difficult year-over-year comparisons in roofing due to storm and repair activity that drove sales in fiscal 2011. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross Profit increased 6.5% to $25.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $24.3 billion for fiscal 2011. Gross Profit for fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the China store closings. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 34.5% for fiscal 2011, an increase of 10 basis points. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by a change in mix of products sold and benefits from our supply chain transformation in the U.S. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nSG&#38;A increased 3.0% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2012 from $16.0 billion for fiscal 2011. SG&#38;A for fiscal 2012 included a $135 million charge related to the China store closings. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#38;A was 22.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 22.8% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales was 21.9% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage \n\n&#32;21 \n\nresulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls, and lower credit card expense and casualty reserves, offset by the charge related to the China store closings. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization was $1.6 billion for both fiscal 2012 and 2011. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.1% for fiscal 2012 compared to 2.2% for fiscal 2011. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating Income increased 16.6% to $7.8 billion for fiscal 2012 from $6.7 billion for fiscal 2011. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 10.4% for fiscal 2012 compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Operating Income increased 18.8% to $7.9 billion for fiscal 2012. \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nIn fiscal 2012, we recognized $545 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $593 million for fiscal 2011. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.7% for fiscal 2012 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2011. Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate was 37.2% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was higher than fiscal 2011 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $145 million charge related to the China store closings. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2012. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements. \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share were $3.00 for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.47 for fiscal 2011. Excluding the charge related to the China store closings, Diluted Earnings per Share were $3.10 for fiscal 2012. The 53 rd &#32;week increased Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.07 for fiscal 2012. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2013 , Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $ 7.6 billion &#32;compared to $ 7.0 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . This increase &#32;is primarily due to an $850 million &#32; increase &#32;in Net Earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. \n\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2013 &#32;was $ 1.5 billion &#32;compared to $ 1.4 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . This change was primarily due to a $77 million increase in Capital Expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. \n\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2013 &#32;was $ 6.7 billion &#32;compared to $ 5.0 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The year-over-year increase of approximately $1.7 billion reflects a $4.6 billion increase in share repurchases, a $500 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders and $543 million less in proceeds from the sale of common stock, offset for the most part by $4.0 billion, net of repayments, of proceeds from long-term borrowings in fiscal 2013. \n\nIn February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a new $17.0 billion share repurchase program, under which we have repurchased 111 million &#32;shares of our common stock for a total of $8.5 billion &#32;as of the end of fiscal 2013 . We entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase $6.2 billion &#32;of our common stock in fiscal 2013 . Under the agreements, we paid $6.2 billion &#32;to the financial institutions and received a total of 81 million &#32;shares. Also in fiscal 2013 , we repurchased 30 million &#32;additional shares of our common stock for $2.3 billion &#32;through the open market. \n\nIn September 2013, we issued $1.15 billion &#32;of 2.25% &#32;senior notes due September 10, 2018 &#32;(the \"2018 notes&#8221;) at a discount of $1 million , $1.1 billion &#32;of 3.75% &#32;senior notes due February 15, 2024 &#32;(the \"2024 notes&#8221;) at a discount of $6 million &#32;and $1.0 billion &#32;of 4.875% &#32;senior notes due February 15, 2044 &#32;(the \"2044 notes&#8221;) at a discount of $15 million &#32;(together, the \"September 2013 issuance\"). Interest on the 2018 notes is due semi-annually on March 10 and September 10 &#32;of each year, beginning March 10, 2014. Interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 &#32;of each year, beginning February 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the September 2013 issuance were used for general corporate \n\n&#32;22 \n\npurposes, including repayment of our $1.25 billion &#32; 5.25% &#32;senior notes that matured December 16, 2013 &#32;and repurchases of shares of our common stock. \n\nIn April 2013, we issued $1.0 billion &#32;of 2.70% &#32;senior notes due April 1, 2023 &#32;at a discount of $2 million &#32;and $1.0 billion &#32;of 4.20% &#32;senior notes due April 1, 2043 &#32;at a discount of $4 million &#32;(together, the \"April 2013 issuance\"). Interest on these senior notes is due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 &#32;of each year, beginning October 1, 2013. The net proceeds of the April 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. \n\nIn November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 10, 2018 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on the 2018 notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 88 basis points. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of $1 million , which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreement. \n\nAlso in November 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on September 15, 2020 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 3.95% &#32;senior notes due September 15, 2020 &#32;for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 183 basis points. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $2 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. \n\nAt February 2, 2014, we had an outstanding interest rate swap that expires on March 1, 2016 , with a notional amount of $500 million , accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 5.40% &#32;senior notes due March 1, 2016 &#32;for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. At February 2, 2014, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $28 million , which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. \n\nWe have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion . The credit facility expires in July 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. At February 2, 2014 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. As of February 2, 2014 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility. \n\nWe use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nIn connection with the sale of HD Supply on August 30, 2007, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. In March 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. In April 2012, the term loan guarantee was terminated. As a result, we reversed the $67 million liability related to the guarantee, resulting in a $67 million pretax benefit to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2012. \n\nAs of February 2, 2014 , we had $ 1.9 billion &#32;in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. \n\nIn March 2014, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million &#32;of our common stock. Under the agreement, we paid $950 million &#32;to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million &#32;shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\n&#32;23 \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 2, 2014 &#32;(amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2015-2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017-2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\nTotal Debt (1) \n\n$ \n\n14,255 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,150 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,100 \n\nInterest Payments on Debt (2) \n\n10,795 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,021 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,891 \n\nCapital Lease Obligations (3) \n\n1,180 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Leases \n\n8,196 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,597 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,248 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,456 \n\nPurchase Obligations (4) \n\n1,238 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n35,746 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,933 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,592 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,170 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nExcludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nInterest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nIncludes $ 681 million &#32;of imputed interest. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) \n\nPurchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) \n\nExcludes $708 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At February 2, 2014 , after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 89% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 11% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nAs of February 2, 2014 &#32;we had, net of discounts, $ 14.2 billion &#32;of senior notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of February 2, 2014 &#32;was approximately $ 15.6 billion . \n\nAlthough we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nImpact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices \n\nWe have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. \n\nRevenues \n\nWe recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated \n\n&#32;24 \n\nBalance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. \n\nMerchandise Inventories \n\nOur Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 74% &#32;valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2013 &#32;or 2012 . \n\nIndependent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, \"swell\") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2013 , 2012 &#32;or 2011 . \n\nSelf-Insurance \n\nWe have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers&#8217; compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. We do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. Our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2013 , 2012 &#32;or 2011 . \n\nVendor Allowances \n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors&#8217; products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. \n\nVolume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors&#8217; products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SG&#38;A. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, management&#8217;s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. \n\n&#32;25 \n\nThe assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes management&#8217;s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&#38;A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SG&#38;A the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. \n\nWe make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, as well as for the China store closings in fiscal 2012, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2013 , 2012 &#32;or 2011 . \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. In fiscal 2013 , we elected to estimate the fair values of our identified reporting units using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units would not result in an impairment. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also not result in an impairment. \n\nThe reporting units assessed for impairment during fiscal 2013 were U.S., Canada and Mexico. During fiscal 2013 , we determined that our goodwill balances for each of these reporting units were not impaired, as we determined the fair value for each of these reporting units was substantially above its carrying value. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a charge of $97 million &#32;to impair all of the goodwill associated with our former China reporting unit. There were no impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill for fiscal 2013 , 2012 &#32;or 2011 . \n\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. There were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2013 , 2012 &#32;or 2011 . \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 75, "Negative": 62, "Polarity": 0.09489051025627365, "Subjectivity": 0.046598639439932435}, "similarity_score": 0.9841699167568332, "nlp_result": 0.12221501462838867}
