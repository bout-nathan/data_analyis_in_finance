Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS \n\nThe Company franchises and operates McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. Of the 35,429 &#32;restaurants in 119 &#32;countries at year-end 2013 , 28,691 &#32;were franchised (including 20,355 &#32;franchised to conventional franchisees, 4,747 &#32;licensed to developmental licensees and 3,589 &#32;licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")&#8212;primarily Japan) and 6,738 &#32;were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&#233;cor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. \n\nWe view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to both delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. \n\nThe business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (\"APMEA\"). In addition, throughout this report we present &#8220;Other Countries &#38; Corporate&#8221; that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 31% , 40% &#32;and 23% &#32;of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France, Russia and Germany, collectively, account for 67% &#32;of Europe&#8217;s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 54% &#32;of APMEA&#8217;s revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as &#8220;major markets&#8221; throughout this report and comprise 75% &#32;of total revenues. \n\nIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance \n\n&#160;\n\nand financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company&#8217;s underlying business trends. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company&#8217;s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. \n\n##TABLE_END McDonald&#8217;s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company&#8217;s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nReturn on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. \n\n##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\nThe strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's success. By leveraging our System, we are able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, our business model \n\n10 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report \n\nenables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. \n\nMcDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (\"Plan\") provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation. We continue to focus on our three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to Brand McDonald's within the framework of our Plan. Our initiatives support these priorities, and are executed with a focus on the Plan's five pillars - People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion - to enhance our customers' experience and build shareholder value over the long term. We believe these priorities align with our customers' evolving needs, and - combined with our competitive advantages of convenience, menu variety, geographic diversification and System alignment - will drive long-term sustainable growth. \n\nTo measure our performance as we strive to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSystemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nOperating income growth of 6% to 7%; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nROIIC in the high teens. \n\n##TABLE_END In 2013, Systemwide sales growth was 1% (3% in constant currencies), operating income growth was 2% (3% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was 11.4% &#32;and three-year ROIIC was 20.2% &#32;(see reconciliation on page 23). Our operating income growth and returns fell below our long-term financial targets, reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance. In our heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns. \n\nIn 2013, our comparable sales increased 0.2%, reflecting higher average check and negative comparable guest counts of 1.9%. Challenging conditions, including a flat or contracting informal eating out (&#8220;IEO&#8221;) segment in most major markets, heightened competitive activity and consumer price sensitivity, continued to pressure performance. Furthermore, McDonald&#8217;s customer-facing initiatives did not generate the comparable sales lift or customer visits necessary to overcome these headwinds. \n\nIn 2014, we do not expect significant changes in market dynamics given modest growth projections for the IEO segment. However, we continue to believe that our targets remain achievable over the long term. \n\nThe following is a summary of our 2013 sales performance and our initiatives within the three global growth priorities by major segment. \n\nU.S. \n\nIn the U.S., comparable sales declined 0.2% and comparable guest counts declined 1.6%. Guest visits were down as initiatives did not resonate as strongly as expected with customers amid a sluggish IEO segment and heightened competitive activity. \n\nThe U.S. introduced a number of significant new products (such as Premium McWraps, Egg White Delight McMuffins and an extended line-up of Quarter Pounder Burgers) and featured new limited-time food and beverage options to enhance the relevance of its product offerings. \n\nModernizing the customer experience continued through our reimaging program. During 2013, we completed about 700 restaurant reimages, of which the majority added drive-thru capacity. Currently, 45% of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe broadened accessibility by opening 225 new restaurants, extending hours in more restaurants, and improving the efficiency of our drive-thru service with side-by-side or tandem ordering, and hand-held order taking. More than half of our restaurants now use one of these multiple order points to maximize drive-thru capacity. In addition, the U.S. evolved its value proposition with the recent introduction of Dollar Menu &#38; More, which is intended to offer value and variety to our customers at various price points. \n\nEurope \n\nIn Europe, comparable sales were flat, while comparable guest counts declined 1.5%, as persistently low consumer confidence continued to negatively affect the IEO segment. Comparable sales results reflected positive performance in the U.K. and Russia, which were mostly offset by weak performance in Germany, where we are working on rebuilding brand relevance to address the current negative guest count trend. \n\nIn 2013, we remained focused on growing the business by emphasizing value menu enhancements, premium menu additions, limited-time offers and expansion of the breakfast daypart. We also successfully launched blended ice beverages in the U.K., which positively contributed to results. \n\nIn order to continue providing a relevant, contemporary customer experience, Europe completed about 470 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2013, nearly 100% of restaurant interiors and 80% of exteriors were modernized. \n\nWe increased our accessibility and convenience by opening 312 new restaurants, extending operating hours and optimizing our drive-thrus. We enhanced our value offerings in certain markets with multiple pricing tiers across our menu to appeal to a broad range of customers. For example, in France we launched the Casse-Cro&#251;te, a two-item meal for 4.50 Euro, which positively contributed to recent results in that market. \n\nAPMEA \n\nIn APMEA, comparable sales declined 1.9% and comparable guest counts declined 3.8%. Our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales, with Japan having the most significant impact. Though the challenges differ across the segment, overall performance was pressured amid slower economic growth, a highly competitive environment focused primarily on value, and issues such as Avian influenza in a few markets. In addition, softer than expected performance of new products and promotions did not overcome negative guest count trends. \n\nThroughout the segment, we focused on accelerating growth across all dayparts, with particular emphasis on dinner and the expansion of breakfast. APMEA held a National Breakfast Day, during which five thousand restaurants gave away five million Egg McMuffins to promote breakfast in the segment. We were also committed to enhancing local relevance with consumers, by balancing our global core menu with locally-relevant food and beverage choices, which included new flavor profiles designed to match local tastes. \n\nWe continued to make progress in our reimaging program, completing about 240 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2013, over 65% of restaurant interiors and over 55% of exteriors were modernized. \n\nWe opened 731 new restaurants, including 275 in China. We deployed our convenience initiatives to more restaurants, including dessert kiosks, delivery service, drive-thrus and extended hours. In addition, we continued to evolve our everyday value platform by including more affordable menu options and promotional offers across dayparts and price points. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 11 \n\nConsolidated Operating Results \n\nGlobally, our approach to offering variety and value across the menu to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies, and leveraging our scale and supply chain infrastructure to manage costs. In 2013, we maintained a full-year combined operating margin of 31.2%, as we grew revenues 2% and managed our expenses. \n\nWe continued our long-standing commitment to fiscal discipline and maintained a strong financial foundation. Cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are important to McDonald's being not just a global brand, but also a locally-relevant one. \n\nIn 2013, cash from operations was $7.1 billion. &#32; Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion were invested in our business, of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,438 restaurants were opened and over 1,500 existing locations were reimaged. \n\nWe continued to return all free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders, and in 2013 returned $4.9 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.1 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in share repurchases. \n\nRESULTS FROM THE YEAR: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nGlobal comparable sales increased 0.2% and comparable guest counts declined 1.9%. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConsolidated revenues increased 2% (2% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConsolidated operating income increased 2% (3% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nDiluted earnings per share was $5.55, an increase of 4% (4% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCash provided by operations was $7.1 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nOne-year ROIIC was 11.4% &#32; and three-year ROIIC was 20.2% &#32; for the period ended December 31, 2013. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.81 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.24 per share. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n\n##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2014 &#32; \n\nWe are focused on delivering great-tasting, high-quality, affordable food and beverages and an exceptional experience for our customers. By leveraging our competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to pursue the long-term opportunities that exist in the over $1 trillion IEO segment. \n\nWe do not expect significant changes in market dynamics in 2014 given modest growth projections for the IEO segment. We will remain focused on matters within our control, with the customer as our first priority. We plan to strengthen our relationship with the customer through better restaurant execution and by further leveraging consumer insights in our efforts to optimize current initiatives for greater relevance and broader consumer reach. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe remain committed to adapting to keep pace with evolving customer needs and investing today to meet future demand. In addition, we are prioritizing our near-term efforts on improving performance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results. These include Germany, Japan and the U.S., which have experienced weak or negative performance. \n\nWe will continue to execute against our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to Brand McDonald&#8217;s. \n\nOur focus will be on our core classics, as well as menu items in the beef, chicken, breakfast and beverages categories, where we believe there is the most growth opportunity relative to other categories in the industry. In addition, we plan to introduce new ingredients and greater choice to broaden the appeal of our menu. \n\nWe will enhance the customer experience by continuing to reimage our building interiors and exteriors, expand our service offerings and develop our digital strategies. At the same time, we remain committed to Quality, Service and Cleanliness, which is foundational to everything we do in the restaurants. \n\nTo broaden our accessibility, we plan to expand through geographically diversified new restaurant development, extend hours in more restaurants, improve the efficiency of our drive-thrus and provide more delivery service and dessert kiosks. In addition, we will continue to evolve our value platform, offering more choices at every price tier. \n\nFurthermore, McDonald&#8217;s is committed to growing our business sustainably and making a positive difference in society. Our key areas of focus include improving customer perceptions of our food, sustainable sourcing, providing job opportunities and training for our people, developing environmentally efficient restaurants and having a positive impact in the communities we serve. \n\nU.S. \n\nIn 2014, the U.S. will make adjustments designed to regain momentum, including providing greater customer relevance and better restaurant execution. Our 2014 menu strategies better balance affordability, core products, new choices and limited-time offers. We will also adjust the pace of product introductions to improve restaurant operations and marketing execution in order to provide a better customer experience. These initiatives are complemented by a consistent focus on core equities, such as breakfast. We will enhance the breakfast experience by emphasizing coffee through high-quality McCaf&#233; products paired with delicious foods - both existing and new. Bold new flavor extensions will be introduced to build upon our core and lay the groundwork for future innovations. We plan to open about 250 new restaurants and to continue our reimaging program by updating &#32; approximately 300 existing restaurants in 2014, a slightly slower pace as we prioritize other kitchen investments. \n\nEurope \n\nIn Europe, we plan to optimize the menu through value menu enhancements, premium menu additions and limited-time offers, and will continue to expand the breakfast daypart by leveraging our strong foundation in coffee. In addition, following the U.K.&#8217;s successful rollout of McCaf&#233; smoothies and frapp&#233;s, we anticipate about 4,500 restaurants in Europe will have the blended-ice platform by the end of 2014. \n\nTo modernize the way we interact with our customers, we plan to leverage the use of technology, such as self-order kiosks and mobile and web ordering. We will focus on broadening accessibility by continuing to extend operating hours, optimizing drive-thrus, and expanding everyday value platforms. We plan to open over 300 &#32; new restaurants and reimage approximately 400 existing restaurants in 2014. \n\n12 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report \n\nAPMEA \n\nIn 2014, APMEA&#8217;s growth opportunities include menu variety, convenience, value evolution and restaurant expansion. We will balance core and limited-time offers and execute a series of exciting food events. APMEA will shift existing value platforms toward more compelling offers that resonate with customers and generate incremental visits, including &#8220;mid-tier&#8221; options to fill the gap between entry-level options and Extra Value Meals. Our efforts around reimaging will continue as we expect to modernize approximately 400 existing restaurants. Our plan is to open around 800 new restaurants, with about 300 expected in China. In addition, we will evolve our franchising strategy to include more conventional franchisees and developmental licensees, enabling an increased pace of development and enhanced profitability. \n\nConsolidated \n\nIn making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable long-term growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate strong returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. \n\nMcDonald's does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nChanges in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2.5 percentage points to 2014 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 949 net restaurants (1,098 net traditional openings less 149 net satellite closings) added in 2013. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nWith about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2014, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.0-2.0% in the U.S. and Europe. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects full-year 2014 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 8% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. The increase is primarily due to the impact of below target 2013 incentive-based compensation, expenses associated with our Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games, and costs related to other initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nBased on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2014 to increase approximately 5-7% compared with 2013. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nA significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2014 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects capital expenditures for 2014 to be between $2.9 - $3.0 billion. Over half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,500 - 1,600 restaurants including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 1,000 - 1,100 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, in part through reimaging. Over 1,000 restaurants worldwide are expected to be reimaged, including locations in affiliated and developmental licensee markets that require no capital investment from the Company. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects to return approximately $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2014. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 13 \n\nConsolidated Operating Results \n\n##TABLE_START Operating results \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars and shares in millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,875 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,603 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,293 \n\nRevenues from franchised restaurants \n\n&#160; \n\n9,231 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,964 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,713 \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n28,106 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27,567 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27,006 \n\nOperating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany-operated restaurant expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n15,579 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14,838 \n\nFranchised restaurants-occupancy expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n1,624 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,481 \n\nSelling, general &#38; administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n2,386 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,455 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,394 \n\nOther operating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n(247 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(244 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(237 \n\n) \n\nTotal operating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n19,342 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18,962 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18,476 \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n8,764 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,605 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,530 \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNonoperating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nn/m \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(64 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome before provision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n8,204 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,012 \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n2,618 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,509 \n\nNet income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,586 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,465 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,503 \n\nEarnings per common share&#8212;diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.55 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.36 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.27 \n\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding&#8212; \n\ndiluted \n\n&#160; \n\n1,006.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,020.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,044.9 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nn/m Not meaningful \n\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS \n\nWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald&#8217;s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. \n\nIn 2013, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and many other foreign currencies, partly offset by the stronger Euro.

Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses.

The decrease in 2012 was primarily due to Australia. \n\nThe franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries &#38; Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCompany-operated margins \n\n##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. &#32; Company-operated margin dollars decreased $83 million or 2% (2% in constant currencies) in 2013, and decreased $76 million or 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2012. \n\nIn 2013, Company-operated margin dollars reflected weak comparable sales in many markets, which impacted our ability to overcome cost pressures.

Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. \n\n##TABLE_START Cash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\nCash provided by operations totaled $7.1 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.3 billion in 2013, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.9 billion in 2012. In 2013, cash provided by operations increased $155 million or 2% compared with 2012 primarily due to increased operating results. In 2012, cash provided by operations decreased $184 million or 3% compared with 2011 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\nCash used for investing activities totaled $2.7 billion in 2013, a decrease of $493 million compared with 2012. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits. Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $596 million compared with 2011. The increase primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, an increase in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits, and lower proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. \n\nCash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2013, an increase of $193 million compared with 2012, primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividend payments, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.8 billion in 2012, a decrease of $683 million compared with 2011, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases and higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher dividend payments. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash and equivalents balance was $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion at year end 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company made a debt repayment of $535 million in January 2014. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. \n\nRESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n\nIn 2013, the Company opened 1,393 traditional restaurants and 45 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 295 traditional restaurants and 194 satellite restaurants. In 2012, the Company opened 1,404 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants and closed 269 traditional restaurants and 200 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure. \n\nSystemwide restaurants at year end (1) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n14,278 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,157 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,098 \n\nEurope \n\n7,602 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,368 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,156 \n\nAPMEA \n\n9,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,454 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,865 \n\nOther Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n3,631 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,501 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,391 \n\nTotal \n\n35,429 \n\n&#160; \n\n34,480 \n\n&#160; \n\n33,510 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nIncludes satellite units at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, as follows: U.S.&#8212;973, 997, 1,084; Europe&#8212;261, 246, 240; APMEA (primarily Japan)&#8212;733, 871, 949; Other Countries &#38; Corporate&#8212;451, 453, 459. \n\n##TABLE_END Approximately 70% of Company-operated restaurants and 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2013. Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2013 were franchised. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 19 \n\nCapital expenditures decreased $224 million or 7% in 2013, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures increased $319 million or 12% in 2012, primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. In 2013, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer planned reimages. In both years, the increase related to new restaurants reflected our commitment to broaden accessibility to our brand. \n\nCapital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. \n\nCapital expenditures &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START In millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNew restaurants \n\n$ \n\n1,473 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,340 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,193 \n\nExisting restaurants \n\n1,244 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,615 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,432 \n\nOther (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal capital expenditures \n\n$ \n\n2,825 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,049 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,730 \n\nTotal assets \n\n$ \n\n36,626 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,386 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n32,990 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nPrimarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures. \n\n##TABLE_END New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald&#8217;s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.0 million in 2013. \n\nThe Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2013 and 2012. \n\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS \n\nFor the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. \n\nShares repurchased and dividends &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of shares repurchased \n\n18.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n28.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n41.9 \n\nShares outstanding at year end \n\n&#160; \n\n1,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,021 \n\nDividends declared per share \n\n$ \n\n3.12 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.87 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.53 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTreasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) \n\n$ \n\n1,810 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,605 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,373 \n\nDividends paid \n\n3,115 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,897 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,610 \n\nTotal returned to shareholders \n\n$ \n\n4,925 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,502 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,983 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, effective August 1, 2012, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2013, approximately 18.7 million shares were repurchased for $1.8 billion , bringing the total purchases under the program to $2.6 billion. \n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 38 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2013 full year dividend of $ 3.12 &#32;per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.77 per share, with an increase to $0.81 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.24 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company&#8217;s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\n##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS \n\nTotal assets increased $1.2 billion or 4% in 2013. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.5 billion in 2013. Approximately 80% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2013. Net property and equipment increased $1.1 billion in 2013, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation, and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. \n\nOperating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. \n\nReturns on assets and equity \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReturn on average assets \n\n24.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n25.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n26.0 \n\n% \n\nReturn on average common \n\nequity \n\n35.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n37.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n37.7 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2013, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower growth in operating results. In 2012, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily on operating income and net income. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. \n\n20 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report \n\nFINANCING AND MARKET RISK \n\nThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2013 totaled $14.1 billion, compared with $13.6 billion at December 31, 2012. The net increase in 2013 was primarily due to net issuances of $535 million. \n\nDebt highlights (1) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed-rate debt as a percent of total \n\ndebt (2,3) \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWeighted-average annual interest \n\nrate of total debt (3) \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\nForeign currency-denominated debt \n\nas a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal debt as a percent of total \n\ncapitalization (total debt and total \n\nShareholders' equity) (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations as a \n\npercent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nAll percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nBased on debt obligations before the effect of fair value hedging adjustments.

There are no provisions in the Company&#8217;s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#8217;s business. Under existing authorization from the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2013, the Company had $3.6 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2014 is approximately $530 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2014, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2013, the Company's subsidiaries also had $610 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. \n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders&#8217; equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.8 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company&#8217;s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. \n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2013, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company&#8217;s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company&#8217;s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: \n\nForeign currency net asset exposures \n\n##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nEuro \n\n$ \n\n7,302 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,692 \n\nAustralian Dollars \n\n1,933 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,450 \n\nBritish Pounds Sterling \n\n1,479 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,117 \n\nCanadian Dollars \n\n1,412 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,319 \n\nRussian Ruble \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company&#8217;s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2013 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2013 levels would materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. \n\nLIQUIDITY \n\nThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 21 \n\nand will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. \n\nConsistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. \n\nWhile the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2013 .

At December 31, 2013, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $531 million . \n\nIn addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $513 million &#32;at December 31, 2013. \n\nThere are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company&#8217;s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START Other Matters \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nManagement&#8217;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. \n\nThe Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nProperty and equipment \n\n##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management&#8217;s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nShare-based compensation \n\n##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. \n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock over the expected \n\n22 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report \n\nlife and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLong-lived assets impairment review \n\n##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company&#8217;s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company&#8217;s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLitigation accruals \n\n##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after \n\ncareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nIncome taxes \n\n##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. \n\nThe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2014. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments (\"NOPAs\") in 2014 and expects to receive additional NOPAs within the next 12 months from the IRS related to certain transfer pricing matters. It is reasonably possible that the receipt of these future NOPAs will provide new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification. \n\nDeferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.1 billion &#32;related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. \n\nEFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES&#8212;INFLATION \n\nThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. \n\nRECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL \n\nROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company&#8217;s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. \n\nThe denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter&#8217;s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2013 &#32;investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2013 &#32;investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2012 &#32;is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2013 &#32;operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2012 &#32;investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. \n\nThe reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: \n\n&#160;
