Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, as well as through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to as our &#8220;Direct to Consumer&#8221; or \"DTC\" operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, &#8220;must have&#8221; products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. \n\nIn addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nExpanding gross margin by: \n\n##TABLE_END - Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price-to-value proposition; \n\n- &#32;Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design, and innovation; and \n\n- &#32;Making our supply chain a competitive advantage. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nImproving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nImproving working capital efficiency; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeploying capital effectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigh single-digit revenue growth, \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMid-teens earnings per share growth, \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nConsistent return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSteady results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. \n\n##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 9% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 22% to 25% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 190 basis points. \n\nOn November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. \n\nOur fiscal 2014 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings, and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2014. Our revenues grew 10% to $27.8 billion, net income from continuing operations increased 10% to $2.7 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per common share of $2.97, an 11% increase from fiscal 2013. \n\nEarnings before interest and income taxes (\"EBIT\") from continuing operations increased 10% for fiscal 2014, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across nearly all NIKE &#160; Brand geographies, key categories, and product types. This growth was primarily fueled by: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInnovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE AIR, Lunar, Shox, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, FlyKnit, NIKE+, and NIKE Fuel; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes and teams, high-impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the World Cup, Olympics, and NFL Super Bowl) and digital marketing; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStrong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. \n\n##TABLE_END We also delivered strong results for Converse, with revenue and EBIT growth of 16% and 17%, respectively. \n\nOur gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices and contribution from our higher margin DTC business, partially offset by higher product input costs, due primarily to labor cost inflation in our product costs, and foreign currency headwinds. \n\nFor fiscal 2014, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate. In addition, diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases. \n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of $107 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of $231 million, net of tax. As of May 31, 2013, the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses. Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company's continuing operations; refer to our &#8220;Discontinued Operations\" section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations. \n\nWhile macroeconomic uncertainties in the global economy are likely to persist, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. \n\n##TABLE_START Results of Operations \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company&#8217;s continuing operations. \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions, except per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,799 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,313 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,331 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n15,353 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,279 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13,183 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGross profit \n\n&#160; \n\n12,446 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,034 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10,148 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGross margin % \n\n&#160; \n\n44.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n43.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n43.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nDemand creation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n3,031 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,607 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOperating overhead expense \n\n&#160; \n\n5,735 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4,472 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal selling and administrative expense \n\n&#160; \n\n8,766 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,796 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n7,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n% of Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n31.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n30.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n30.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense (income), net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther expense (income), net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nIncome before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n3,544 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,011 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nIncome tax expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n25.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income from continuing operations \n\n&#160; \n\n2,693 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,451 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,257 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(46 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nNet income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,693 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,472 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,211 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nDiluted earnings per share - continuing operations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.97 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.68 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.40 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nDiluted earnings per share - discontinued operations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.02 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.05 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nPrior year amounts have been revised to correctly expense internally developed patent and trademark costs as incurred.

These changes had no impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders' equity. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nResults have been restated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends by excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions revenues primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) \n\nCorporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency revenue-related hedge gains and losses generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) \n\nReferences to NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers, and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) \n\nOthers include all unisex products, equipment, and other products not allocated to Men's, Women's, and Young Athletes', as well as certain adjustments that are not allocated to products designated by gender or age. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) \n\nOthers include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2014, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe and Emerging Markets each contributed 2 percentage points and Central &#38; Eastern Europe and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 4% during fiscal 2014. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our Basketball, Sportswear, Running, and Football (Soccer) categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles; Running models with NIKE Free, Air Max, Lunar, and FlyKnit technologies; and performance Football (Soccer) products. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 5%, driven nearly equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. \n\nFor NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably our Football (Soccer), Running, and Women's Training categories. In fiscal 2014, unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 4%, driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher priced products. \n\nWhile wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2014, DTC revenues represented approximately 20% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 18% in fiscal 2013. On a currency neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 22% for fiscal 2014, as comparable store sales grew 10% and we continued to open new stores and expand our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 42% in fiscal 2014. Online sales represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 12% for fiscal 2013. \n\nOn a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% mainly as a result of strong growth in our Basketball, Football (Soccer), Running, and Sportswear categories. Women's revenues increased 12% in large part due to increases in our Running, Sportswear, and Women's Training categories. The 16% increase in the Young Athletes' business was driven by increases in the Basketball and Football (Soccer) categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues from our NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2013, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography except Greater China delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013. North America contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Emerging Markets contributed 2 percentage points and Western and Central &#38; Eastern Europe each contributed 1 percentage point. Greater China ' s results reduced NIKE, Inc. revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues for Converse contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth. \n\nExcluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 11% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 17% during fiscal 2013. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including Running models with NIKE Free and Lunar technologies, NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles, and performance Football (Soccer) products. In fiscal 2013, unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4%, driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. \n\nFor NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men ' s Training category (which includes the NFL licensed business), in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products, such as performance Running, Basketball, and NFL licensed apparel; and to a lesser extent, higher selling prices . \n\nFor fiscal 2013, DTC channels represented approximately 18% of overall NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2012. On a currency neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 24% for fiscal 2013, as comparable store sales grew 14% and we continued to expand our store network and e-commerce businesses. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 32% in fiscal 2013 and represented approximately 12% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2013. \n\nOn a wholesale equivalent and currency neutral basis, fiscal 2013 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% due primarily to growth in our Running, Men's Training, and Basketball categories. Women's revenues increased 9% driven primarily by an increase in Running and Women's Training. The 11% increase in the Young Athletes' business was due primarily to increases in Basketball. \n\nFutures Orders \n\nFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2014 were 11% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. &#160; Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. &#160; Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 4 percentage points of growth, respectively. \n\nBy geography, futures orders growth was as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReported Futures \n\nOrders Growth \n\n&#160; \n\nFutures Orders \n\nExcluding Currency Changes (1) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGreater China \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nJapan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal NIKE Brand futures orders \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nGrowth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts, and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, NIKE Brand equipment, DTC operation sales, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf, and Hurley. \n\nGross Margin \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nGross profit \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,446 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,034 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,148 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margin % \n\n&#160; \n\n44.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n43.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n&#160; \n\n43.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2014, our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2013, primarily driven by higher NIKE Brand average selling prices (increasing gross margin approximately 160 basis points), attributable to both price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. Gross margin was also positively impacted by growth in our higher margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points) and improved margins due to cleaner closeout inventories (increasing margin approximately 20 basis points). These increases in gross margin were partially offset by higher product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points), primarily due to a shift in mix to higher cost products, as well as product labor input cost inflation. Gross margins were also negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points). \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2013, our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher average selling prices (approximately 160 basis points) that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix. The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs (approximately 110 basis points), primarily due to higher factory labor costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (approximately 40 basis points). \n\nIn addition, in fiscal 2013 we experienced significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivered incremental revenue and profits, it had a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin. \n\nTotal Selling and Administrative Expense \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nDemand creation expense (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,031 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,607 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating overhead expense (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n5,735 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4,472 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal selling and administrative expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,766 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,796 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% of Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n31.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n30.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n&#160; \n\n30.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nFiscal 2013 and 2012 amounts have been revised to correctly expense internally developed patent and trademark costs as incurred.

For fiscal 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense. \n\nCompared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 14%, primarily attributable to growth in our DTC business driven by new store openings, higher personnel costs, and e-commerce launches, as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nDemand creation expense increased 5% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE FuelBand and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Demand creation expense increased 8%. \n\nCompared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 13%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our DTC operations, higher personnel costs, and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business.

This change was primarily driven by a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses as well as the recognition of a $24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand ' s Western Europe operations in fiscal 2012. These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from non-operating items. \n\nWe estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $56 million for fiscal 2013. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(70) bps \n\n&#160; \n\n25.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(30) bps \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 &#32; \n\nThe 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, we reached a resolution with the IRS on an Advanced Pricing Agreement. This agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 9 &#8212; Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nThe 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the U.S. legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nDuring fiscal 2013, we divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse, and Hurley brands. The results of the divestiture are presented as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 15 &#8212; Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Segments \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur reportable operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization, which changed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The NIKE Brand segments continue to be defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity, which now includes the results of NIKE Golf and Hurley. Previously, NIKE Golf and Hurley were combined with Converse and reported as \"Other Businesses.\" \n\nEach NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. The Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central &#38; Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. The Company&#8217;s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing, and selling of casual sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to fiscal 2014 presentation. \n\nAs part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity&#8217;s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. \n\nThe breakdown of revenues is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,299 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,158 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,538 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n4,979 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4,212 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n1,387 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,229 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,146 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nGreater China \n\n&#160; \n\n2,602 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,478 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,561 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nJapan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n3,949 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,832 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,523 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTotal NIKE Brand Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n26,112 \n\n&#160; \n\n23,881 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n22,011 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nConverse \n\n&#160; \n\n1,684 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,449 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,324 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nCorporate (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories fueled the revenue growth in fiscal 2014. DTC revenue growth in North America for fiscal 2014 was driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 16 net new stores, and strong online sales growth. \n\nFootwear revenues growth in North America was driven by higher demand in nearly all key categories, led by our Basketball, Running, and Sportswear categories. For fiscal 2014, unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 4%. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven by price increases and shift in mix toward higher priced products in nearly equal amounts. \n\nNorth America apparel revenues growth was fueled by higher demand in all key categories, most notably our Men ' s Training, Women's Training, and Sportswear categories. Both unit sales and average selling price per unit increased, with unit sales increasing 6% and average selling price per unit increasing 4%. The increase in average selling price per unit was primarily driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, a change in mix to higher priced products. \n\nNorth America EBIT increased at a faster rate than revenues due to gross margin expansion and slight selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 120 basis points for fiscal 2014, reflecting pricing initiatives as well as lower product costs as a result of favorable changes in product mix. These gross margin benefits were partially offset by higher off-price mix. Selling and administrative expenses grew in line with revenues as a result of higher operating overhead costs to support DTC growth and higher demand creation expense in support of the World Cup and key product and brand initiatives. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOur category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections, and compelling retail experiences to consumers in North America, driving increased demand for NIKE Brand products across all key categories except Action Sports. Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories drove the revenue growth in fiscal 2013. North America ' s DTC revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales as well as the addition of new stores and rapid growth in online sales. \n\nNorth America footwear revenues growth was driven by higher demand in all key categories, most notably Basketball, Running, and Sportswear. Both unit sales and average selling price per pair increased 7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven approximately equally by price increases and a favorable mix of higher priced products. \n\nApparel revenues growth in North America was driven by higher demand in our Men ' s Training category, reflecting the addition of the NFL licensed business, as well as Basketball, Women ' s Training, and Running. Unit sales increased 9% while average selling price per unit increased 11%, largely driven by a favorable mix of higher priced products. \n\nNorth America EBIT increased faster than revenues due to gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2013, reflecting the favorable impact of selling price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, an unfavorable mix of lower margin products, and royalties for the NFL business. Selling and administrative expenses increased versus fiscal 2012, though at a rate slower than revenues; the growth was largely driven by higher demand creation expense for the Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as well as key product initiatives, including the NFL launch, and higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business. \n\nWestern Europe \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,299 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,538 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n1,427 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,289 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,407 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,979 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,212 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales to Wholesale Customers \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,481 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,623 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nSales Direct to Consumer \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,979 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,212 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 &#32; \n\nThe ongoing implementation of the category offense in Western Europe yielded successful results in fiscal 2014.

Revenues for the U.K. &#160; &#38; Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), our largest territories in Western Europe, increased 20% and 23%, respectively. On a category basis, revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was fueled by our Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth in DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by 17% growth in comparable store sales, rapid growth in online sales, and the addition of 19 net new stores. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenues growth in Western Europe reflected increases in every key category, most notably our Sportswear, Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball categories. Unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased 11% and average selling price per pair increased 9%. The increase in average price per pair was primarily the result of price increases, a shift in mix to higher priced products, and lower discounts. \n\nThe constant currency increase in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to increases in Football (Soccer), Running, and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 3% while average selling price per unit increased 4%, driven primarily by lower discounts on off-price closeout sales compared to the prior year. \n\nOn a reported basis, Western Europe EBIT for fiscal 2014 grew at a faster rate than revenues as a result of a 150 basis point increase in gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. The gross margin increase was fueled by higher average selling prices, growth in our higher margin DTC business, lower discounts, and lower off-price mix, which more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product input costs. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percentage of revenue despite higher operating overhead costs to support growth in our DTC business and higher demand creation spending for sports marketing to support key events such as the World Cup. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, most territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2013, which more than offset revenues declines of 17% and 18% in Italy and Iberia, respectively, reflecting poor economic conditions in southern Europe. Revenues for the U.K. &#160; &#38; Ireland and AGS territories increased 8% and 12%, respectively. The growth in DTC revenues reflected 17% growth in comparable store sales, the addition of 19 net new stores and strong growth in online sales. On a category basis, Western Europe ' s revenues growth was largely driven by growth in our Running and Basketball categories. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenues growth in Western Europe was primarily driven by growth in Running, Sportswear, and Basketball. Unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 3%, the latter primarily the result of price increases. \n\nThe constant currency decrease in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to a decline in Sportswear, partially offset by growth in Running, Men ' s Training, and Basketball. Unit sales in fiscal 2013 decreased 1% while average selling price per unit decreased 3%, as higher discounts on closeout sales more than offset selling price increases. \n\nThe EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates; higher net average selling prices were mostly offset by higher product costs. The increase in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as higher sports marketing expense. Additionally, operating overhead costs increased to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2013 EBIT growth for Western Europe was also increased by a $24 million, one-time restructuring charge that was recorded in Other expense (income), net, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,387 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,229 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,146 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, Central &#160; &#38; Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth across nearly all territories, particularly Russia, our largest territory, which grew 14%, and Turkey, which grew 17%.

The growth in DTC revenues reflected a 20% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 30 net new stores, as well as online sales growth. The increase in DTC revenues more than offset a 4% decrease in sales in our wholesale business as we continued to manage the amount of product sold into the market and worked with our wholesale partners to optimize product mix for the consumer. On a category basis, higher revenues in our Basketball, Sportswear, and Running categories more than offset declines in Men's Training, Action Sports, and Women's Training. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenues growth for Greater China in fiscal 2014 was driven by increased sales in our Basketball and Sportswear categories, partially offset by declines in our Men's Training, Running, and Action Sports categories. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 were flat compared to the prior year while average selling price per pair increased 5%, driven by favorable revenue mix resulting from a higher percentage of sales from our higher price DTC business, as well as a shift in mix to higher priced product. \n\nConstant currency apparel revenues growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by increases in the Running, Sportswear, and Basketball categories, partially offset by decreases in Men's Training and Women's Training. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2014 were 1% higher while average selling price per unit was flat. \n\nFiscal 2014 reported EBIT for Greater China was flat compared to the prior year as reported revenue and gross margin increases were offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Gross margin increased150 basis points as higher average selling prices, growth in our higher margin DTC business, and improved margins on closeout sales more than offset higher product input costs and unfavorable product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs driven by increased investments to support DTC growth and our new Greater China headquarters in Shanghai, as well as higher demand creation spending. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, Greater China revenues decreased in fiscal 2013, driven by lower futures orders as well as increased discounts, product returns and proactive cancellation of orders to manage inventory levels at retail. These downsides were partially offset by 33% growth in our DTC business driven by comparable store sales growth of 13% and the addition of 29 net new stores. Fiscal 2013 revenues for most key categories were lower than in fiscal 2012. \n\nFor fiscal 2013, constant currency footwear revenues for Greater China declined, driven by lower sales across most key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men ' s Training, and Women ' s Training; and increased reserves for product discounts and returns. Unit sales decreased 1%, while average selling price per pair decreased 2%, reflecting a higher mix of closeout sales and higher discounts. \n\nThe decrease in constant currency apparel revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by lower revenues in Sportswear, Men ' s Training, and Women ' s Training, partially offset by higher revenues in Basketball. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 were 3% lower than the prior year while average selling price per unit was down 5%, reflecting a higher mix of closeout sales and higher discounts. \n\nFiscal 2013 EBIT for Greater China decreased at a faster rate than revenues, driven by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Fiscal 2013 gross margin decreased 50 basis points due to a lower average selling price per unit driven by higher discounts and closeout mix partially offset by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates.

Our largest territory, Brazil, grew 19%, while our SOCO territory (which includes Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile) grew 25%. Mexico revenues decreased 3% as a result of shipping delays caused by issues with a distribution center transition in the first half of fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in nearly every category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, and Sportswear. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenues growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, led by Running, Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Action Sports. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 increased 4% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories, and to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher priced product. \n\nConstant currency apparel revenues increased driven by growth in every key category, most notably Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales increased 11% and average selling price per unit increased 10%, primarily due to price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories. \n\nFiscal 2014 reported EBIT for Emerging Markets decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin, higher selling and administrative expense, and weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. Gross margin decreased 30 basis points due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher product costs, higher warehousing costs related to distribution center transition challenges in Mexico, and higher discounts, which more than offset higher average selling prices and a favorable shift to higher priced products. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and infrastructure investments to support growth, as well as increases in demand creation spending to support the World Cup and key product launches. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2013, constant currency revenues growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in every key category and territory, led by SOCO, Brazil, and Mexico. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenues growth for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in most key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Women ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 9% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by selling price increases. \n\nFiscal 2013 constant currency apparel revenues were driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, Sportswear, and Men ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 10% and average selling price per unit increased 9%, largely attributable to price increases. \n\nFiscal 2013 Emerging Markets EBIT grew faster than revenue primarily driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. Gross margin increased 260 basis points due largely to the favorable impact of price increases, the anniversary of a one-time customs duty charge in fiscal 2012, and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher product costs. As a percent of revenue, selling and administrative expense was higher due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business. \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,021 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,746 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,479 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nGlobal Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation, operating overhead, and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.

Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. \n\nFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 &#32; \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 15% for fiscal 2014. Revenue growth in direct distribution markets, which represent approximately 84% of Converse revenues, contributed 16 percentage points to the total increase for fiscal 2014, while licensing revenues decreased overall revenue by 1 percentage point. Revenues from our direct distribution markets grew 19% for fiscal 2014 driven by growth in \"comparable\" direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years), primarily the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Comparable direct distribution markets revenues increased 13%, contributing 12 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenues growth for fiscal 2014, while conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 7 percentage points. Comparable direct distribution markets unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit increased 1% for fiscal 2014. The increase in average selling price per unit resulted primarily from a favorable mix of higher priced product. Due to market conversions and business declines in Latin America, licensing revenues decreased 3% for fiscal 2014. \n\nOn a reported basis, EBIT at Converse grew 17% for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 80 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well as higher demand creation spending. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nConstant currency revenues for Converse increased 10% for fiscal 2013. Revenue growth in direct distribution markets, which represented approximately 81% of Converse revenues, contributed 11 percentage points to the total increase for fiscal 2013, while licensing revenues decreased overall revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues from our direct distribution markets grew 15% for fiscal 2013 driven by growth in comparable direct distribution markets, primarily the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Comparable direct distribution markets revenues increased 11%, contributing 10 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenues growth for fiscal 2013; conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 5 percentage points. Comparable direct distribution markets unit sales increased 6% and average selling price per unit increased 5% for fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per unit resulted primarily from a higher mix of higher priced product. Due to market conversions and business declines in Latin America, licensing revenues decreased 7% for fiscal 2013. \n\nOn a reported basis, EBIT for Converse grew 8% for fiscal 2013 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 120 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. \n\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nTransactional exposures \n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProduct Costs &#8212; NIKE&#8217;s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. \n\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. \n\nSome NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. \n\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. \n\n##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. \n\n##TABLE_START 2. \n\nFactory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories&#8217; foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (&#8220;factory currency exposure index&#8221;) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (&#8220;factory input costs&#8221;) are denominated. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net . Refer to Note 17 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. \n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE&#8217;s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales &#8212; A portion of our Western Europe and Central &#38; Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther Costs &#8212; Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities &#8212; Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net &#32;within our consolidated results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures \n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales, and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below. \n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net &#32;and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#8212; Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 &#8211; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. \n\nTranslational exposures \n\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results, and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries&#8217; non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders&#8217; Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $288 million and $605 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $49 million and $104 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nManaging translational exposures \n\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#8212; Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. \n\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net &#32;had an unfavorable impact of approximately $139 million and $56 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nNet investments in foreign subsidiaries \n\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of Other expense (income), net . The impact of ineffective hedges was immaterial for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in Other comprehensive income. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2014 and 2013. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013. \n\n##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCash Flow Activity \n\nCash provided by operations was $3,003 million &#32;for fiscal 2014 &#32;compared to $2,968 million &#32;for fiscal 2013 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2014 &#32;was net income of $2,693 million . Our fiscal 2014 &#32;change in working capital was a net cash outflow &#32;of $488 million &#32;as compared to a net cash outflow &#32;of $78 million &#32;for fiscal 2013 . Our investments in working capital increased due to higher inventory levels to support higher reported futures orders, growth in accounts receivable reflecting the increase in sales, and higher prepaid marketing expenses in advance of the World Cup. These increases in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. \n\nCash used by investing activities was $1,207 million &#32;during fiscal 2014 , compared to a $940 million &#32;use of cash for fiscal 2013 . A major driver of the change was a $282 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment from $598 million in fiscal 2013 to $880 million in fiscal 2014, reflective of investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, as well as digital capabilities. In fiscal 2014, we made $328 million in net purchases of short-term investments (net of sales/maturities) compared to $1,140 million &#32;in net purchases (net of sales/maturities) in fiscal 2013. Cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2013 was partially offset by $786 million in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan. \n\nCash used by financing activities was $2,914 million &#32;for fiscal 2014 &#32;compared to $1,045 million &#32;for fiscal 2013 , an increase of $1,869 million. The increase was primarily due to a $954 million increase in share repurchases to $2,628 million, a $ 986 million &#32;decrease in net proceeds from long term debt issuance (reflecting the issuance of 10- and 30-year notes in April 2013), and a $96 million increase in dividends, partially offset by a year-on-year increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. \n\nIn fiscal 2014 , we purchased 36.6 million &#32;shares of NIKE&#8217;s Class B Common Stock for $2,628 million , an average price of $ 71.80 . During fiscal 2013, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2014 , we had repurchased 51.9 million &#32;shares at an average price of $65.83 &#32;for a total cost of $3,417 million &#32;under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nOn April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2016. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. \n\nOn November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. Following an extension agreement on September 17, 2013 between the Company and the syndicate of banks, the facility matures November 1, 2017, with a one-year extension option exercisable through October 31, 2014. No &#32;amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2014 &#32;or 2013 . \n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2014 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. \n\nLiquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2014 , we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2014 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. \n\nAs of May 31, 2014 , we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $5.1 billion , of which $2.5 billion &#32;was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2014 &#32;the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days. \n\nTo date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. \n\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2014 &#32;and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Description of Commitment \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, \n\n(In millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nOperating Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,050 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,804 \n\nCapital Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term Debt (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,851 \n\nEndorsement Contracts (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,381 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,704 \n\nProduct Purchase Obligations (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n3,688 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,688 \n\nOther (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTOTAL \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,497 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,474 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,196 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,931 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,638 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nThe cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2014 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nThe amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. \n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nWe generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2014 . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) \n\nOther amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2014 . \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe total liability for uncertain tax positions was $506 million , excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2014 . We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. \n\nWe also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2014 . Refer to Note 7 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) \n\nOutstanding as of May 31, 2014 \n\nNotes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand \n\n$ \n\nPayable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAs of May 31, 2014 , letters of credit of $135 million &#32;were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company&#8217;s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. \n\n##TABLE_START Recently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard is effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity&#8217;s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Recently Issued Accounting Standards \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \n\nWe believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. \n\nWithin the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. \n\nIn some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. \n\nIn certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. \n\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts, and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts, and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts, and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts, and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. \n\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable \n\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made. \n\nInventory Reserves \n\nWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales. &#160; \n\nContingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts \n\nA significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. \n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. \n\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in Demand creation expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser&#8217;s performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be reported in a future period. \n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset&#8217;s net book value to its salvage value. \n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group&#8217;s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets &#32; \n\nWe perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. \n\nWe generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk, and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. \n\nIn the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities, and money market funds. \n\nLevel 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \n\nA majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. \n\nHedge Accounting for Derivatives \n\nWe use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of forward and option contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net &#32;during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. \n\nWe have used and may in the future use, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders&#8217; equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other expense (income), net &#32;during the period in which changes occur. \n\nStock-based Compensation \n\nWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. \n\nIn addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. \n\nWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. \n\nOn an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. \n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues, and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as Other expense (income), net &#32;during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding, or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 156, "Negative": 254, "Polarity": -0.23902438966091613, "Subjectivity": 0.04488723450351574}, "similarity_score": 0.9888829814194646, "nlp_result": 0}
