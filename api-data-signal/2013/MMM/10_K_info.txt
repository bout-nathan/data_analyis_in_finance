Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M&#146;s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M&#146;s MD&#38;A is presented in eight sections: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#183; &#160; Overview \n\n&#183; &#160; Results of Operations \n\n&#183; &#160; Performance by Business Segment \n\n&#183; &#160; Performance by Geographic Area \n\n&#183; &#160; Critical Accounting Estimates \n\n&#183; &#160; New Accounting Pronouncements \n\n&#183; &#160; Financial Condition and Liquidity \n\n&#183; &#160; Financial Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2013, the Company completed a realignment of its business segments to better serve global markets and customers. In addition, during the first quarter of 2013, as described in Note 16, 3M realigned its geographic area structure to include Puerto Rico in the United States rather than in the Latin America/Canada region. Segment and geographic area information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2013 net income attributable to 3M was $1.103 billion, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to $991 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2012. Fourth-quarter 2013 sales totaled $7.6 billion, an increase of 2.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012. 3M achieved organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in all five of its business segments, led by Industrial. Industrial organic local-currency sales increased 5.8 percent, led by advanced materials, automotive OEM, 3M Purification Inc. (filtration products), aerospace, and automotive aftermarket. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.8 percent in Safety and Graphics, led by roofing granules, personal safety, commercial graphics, and architectural markets. Organic local-currency sales grew 3.6 percent in the Health Care business segment, with the strongest sales growth in health information systems, food safety, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention; organic local-currency sales declined in drug delivery systems. Organic local-currency sales increased 1.3 percent in the Consumer business segment, led by the consumer health care and home care businesses. Electronics and Energy organic local-currency sales growth was 0.4 percent, with increases in energy-related sales led by renewable energy and electrical markets. Electronic-related sales declined, with growth in optical systems and electronic solutions more than offset by declines in other businesses. For the Company in total, organic-local currency sales grew 3.4 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing 2.0 percent and selling price increases contributing 1.4 percent. Acquisitions added 0.7 percent to sales, which related to the late November 2012 acquisition of Ceradyne, Inc. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.7 percent year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 2013 organic local-currency sales growth was 4.5 percent in the United States, 3.4 percent in EMEA, 3.3 percent in Asia Pacific, and 2.2 percent in Latin America/Canada. In the U.S., EMEA, and Asia Pacific, all five business segments generated positive organic local-currency sales growth. Organic local-currency sales growth in the United States was led by Industrial, and Safety and Graphics. Organic local-currency sales growth in EMEA was led by Industrial. West Europe grew organically by 3 percent year-on-year, continuing the positive trends 3M has seen in recent quarters. Organic local-currency sales growth in Asia Pacific was led by Consumer, Safety and Graphics, and Health Care. Sales in Japan grew 4 percent organically. China/Hong Kong grew organically by 1 percent, impacted by a strong prior-year comparison of 16 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and weakness in electronics. Organic local-currency sales growth in Latin America/Canada was positive across most countries, but below recent trend levels for a few reasons. First, slowing in government tenders for infrastructure projects in certain countries impacted sales in Electronics and Energy. Consumer was also soft in the fourth quarter due to weak retail demand and challenging year-on-year comparisons. And lastly, sales in Venezuela declined year-on-year due to the economic and political situation there. Venezuela diluted fourth-quarter organic sales growth in Latin America/Canada by 1.5 percentage points, as 3M continues to work towards minimizing its Bolivar exposure and any associated costs. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2013, net income attributable to 3M was $4.659 billion, or $6.72 per diluted share, compared to $4.444 billion, or $6.32 per diluted share, in 2012, an increase of 6.3 percent on a per diluted share basis. Sales totaled $30.9 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent from 2012. From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales growth was 5.0 percent in Health Care, 4.6 percent in Industrial, 4.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, 3.0 percent in Consumer, and was flat in Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2013 organic local-currency sales growth was 7.1 percent in Latin America/Canada, 3.6 percent in Asia Pacific, 3.1 percent in the United States, and 2.1 percent in EMEA. For the Company in total, organic local-currency sales grew 3.4 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing 2.5 percent and selling price increases contributing 0.9 percent. Acquisitions added 1.4 percent to sales, driven by the November 2012 acquisition of Ceradyne, Inc. (Industrial), the September 2012 purchase of the net assets that comprised the business of Federal Signal Technologies Group (Safety and Graphics), and the April 2012 acquisition of CodeRyte, Inc. (Health Care). Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.6 percent year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2013 was 21.6 percent of sales, compared to 21.7 percent of sales in 2012, a decline of 0.1 percentage points. Items that reduced operating income margins included lower factory utilization/productivity, strategic investments (including business transformation, enabled by 3M&#146;s global ERP implementation), the impact of 2012 acquisitions, and other factors. These factors were largely offset by the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, in addition to lower pension/postretirement benefit costs. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Results of Operations&#148; for further discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe income tax rate was 28.1 percent in 2013, down 0.9 percentage points versus 2012, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 9 cents. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2013 declined 1.4 percent year-on-year to 693.6 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 9 cents. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 11 cents. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2012 net income attributable to 3M was $991 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, compared to $954 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth-quarter 2012 sales totaled $7.4 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011. Organic local-currency sales grew 4.3 percent, acquisitions added 0.9 percent to sales, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.0 percent year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, Consumer led with organic local-currency sales growth of 8.8 percent, driven by consumer health care, construction and home improvement markets, and stationery and office supplies. Health Care organic local-currency sales grew 5.9 percent, with positive growth in all businesses, led by food safety, health information systems, critical and chronic care, and oral care. Electronics and Energy organic local-currency sales growth was 4.4 percent, led by optical systems, with sales also increasing in infrastructure protection, electrical, and telecommunication markets, partially offset by declines in renewable energy and electronics markets materials. Industrial organic local-currency sales grew 4.4 percent, led by 3M Purification Inc. (filtration products), aerospace, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and automotive OEM partially offset by declines in advanced materials. Organic local-currency sales declined 0.3 percent in Safety and Graphics, as sales growth in personal safety, architectural markets, commercial graphics, and roofing granules was offset by a year-on-year decline in traffic safety and security systems. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 2012 organic local-currency sales growth was 9.9 percent in Latin America/Canada, 5.8 percent in Asia Pacific, and 5.2 percent in the United States. EMEA organic local-currency sales declined 1.0 percent, impacted by a weak economy in Western Europe. Latin America/Canada sales growth was broad-based, with all five business segments generating positive organic local-currency sales growth, led by Health Care; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. Organic local-currency sales growth increased 11 percent in Brazil, in the face of a still-recovering economy, and Mexico grew nearly 10 percent. In Asia Pacific, Japan declined year-on-year, reflecting continued challenging economic conditions. Organic local-currency sales in the rest of Asia Pacific grew nearly 10 percent, with China up over 16 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth in the United States was led by Consumer. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2012, net income attributable to 3M was $4.444 billion, or $6.32 per diluted share, compared to $4.283 billion, or $5.96 per diluted share, in 2011, an increase of 6.0 percent on a per diluted share basis. Sales totaled $29.9 billion, an increase of 1.0 percent from 2011. Organic local-currency sales grew 2.6 percent, acquisitions added 0.8 percent to sales and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2.4 percent year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales growth was 5.2 percent in Industrial, 4.7 percent in Health Care, 3.6 percent in Consumer, and 2.4 percent in Safety and Graphics. Organic local-currency sales declined 3.7 percent in Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2012 organic local-currency sales growth was 11.1 percent in Latin America/Canada, 4.2 percent in the United States, and 0.1 percent in Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific was impacted by a soft global consumer electronics industry. EMEA organic local-currency sales declined 0.6 percent, impacted by a weak economy in Western Europe. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2012 was 21.7 percent of sales, compared to 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, an improvement of 0.8 percentage points. The primary benefit (as discussed in the Results of Operations section) related to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. Currency effects reduced diluted earnings per share by an estimated 15 cents. Net insurance recoveries in 2012 related to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan increased earnings by approximately 4 cents per diluted share. In 2011, the impact of natural disasters, net of insurance recoveries, reduced earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share. Early retirement/restructuring costs for 2012 totaled approximately 8 cents per diluted share, which included the first quarter 2012 charge of approximately 3 cents per diluted share related to a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe most significant non-operating items that impacted earnings in 2012 when compared to 2011 were diluted shares outstanding and income taxes. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2.2 percent in 2012 to 703.3 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 14 cents when compared to 2011. The income tax rate for 2012 was 29.0 percent compared to 27.8 percent in 2011, which decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 11 cents. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. In addition to the discussion below, refer to the section entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; and &#147;Performance by Geographic Area&#148; later in MD&#38;A for a more detailed discussion of the sales and income results of the Company and its respective business segments (including Corporate and Unallocated).

Four of 3M&#146;s five business segments posted operating income margins in excess of 21 percent in 2013. Worldwide operating income margins for 2013 were 21.6 percent, compared to 21.7 percent for 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in 2012 increased 1.0 percent, led by Consumer at 3.7 percent, Industrial at 3.3 percent and Health Care at 2.5 percent. Sales increased 0.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, and declined 4.8 percent in Electronics and Energy.

Four of 3M&#146;s five business segments posted operating income margins in excess of 21 percent in 2012. Worldwide operating income margins for 2012 were 21.7 percent, compared to 20.9 percent for 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M generated $5.817 billion of operating cash flow in 2013, an increase of $517 million when compared to 2012. This followed an increase of $16 million when comparing 2012 to 2011. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#148; later in MD&#38;A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2014, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $12 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company&#146;s February 2013 repurchase program. This new program has no pre-established end date. In 2013, the Company purchased $5.212 billion of stock, up significantly from $2.204 billion in 2012 and $2.701 billion in 2011. The Company expects to purchase $3 billion to $5 billion of stock in 2014. In December 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2014 dividend of $0.855 per share, an increase of 34.6 percent. This marked the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M&#146;s debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 25 percent at \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 3M has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. The Company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital markets to meet its funding needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2013, the Company experienced stable to declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel. This was driven by year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M&#146;s pension and postretirement plans were 94 percent funded at year-end 2013. The primary U.S. qualified plan, which is approximately 66 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 103 percent funded and the international pension plans were 91 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2013 for the primary U.S. qualified plan was 6.02%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status, which improved to 103 percent funded at year-end 2013, compared to 96 percent funded at year-end 2012. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2014 is 7.75%, a decrease of 0.25 percentage points from 2013. The primary U.S. qualified plan year-end 2013 discount rate was 4.98%, up 0.84 percentage points from the year-end 2012 discount rate of 4.14%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a lower valuation of the projected benefit obligation, which improved the plans&#146; funded status. The changes in 3M&#146;s defined benefit plans&#146; funded status significantly impacted several balance sheet amounts. In the fourth-quarter of 2013, these required annual measurements increased stockholders&#146; equity by $0.9 billion, decreased pension and postretirement benefits&#146; long-term liabilities by $0.8 billion, increased prepaid pension benefits&#146; assets by $0.5 billion, and decreased deferred taxes within other assets by $0.4 billion. Other pension and postretirement changes during the year, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet amounts. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2014. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2014. 3M expects defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2014 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2013. The change in both defined benefit and defined contribution plan expenses would increase earnings per share in 2014 by approximately 15 cents per share when compared to 2013, or approximately 17 cents per share including the impact of defined benefit plan expenses only. Refer to &#147;Critical Accounting Estimates&#148; within MD&#38;A and Note 10 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M&#146;s pension and post-retirement plans. In addition, 3M currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2014 will be approximately 28.0 to 29.0 percent, compared to 28.1 percent for 2013. \n\n&#160; \n\nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled &#147;Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results&#148; in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,151 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,720 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,871 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,571 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,333 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,904 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n36.1 \n\n% \n\n63.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n35.3 \n\n% \n\n64.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n% \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n2.5 \n\n% \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n0.8 \n\n% \n\n1.2 \n\n% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5 \n\n) \n\n(1.6 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.6 \n\n) \n\n(2.4 \n\n) \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n% \n\n2.0 \n\n% \n\n3.2 \n\n% \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n(1.1 \n\n)% \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn 2013, organic local-currency sales grew 3.4 percent, with increases of 7.1 percent in Latin America/Canada, 3.6 percent in Asia Pacific, 3.1 percent in the United States, and 2.1 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Worldwide organic local-currency sales grew 5.0 percent in Health Care, 4.6 percent in Industrial, 4.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, 3.0 percent in Consumer, and were flat in Electronics and Energy. Acquisitions added 1.4 percent to worldwide growth and foreign currency translation reduced worldwide sales growth by 1.6 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide selling prices rose 0.9 percent in 2013 and 1.4 percent in 2012. Selling price increases were driven by two primary factors in both 2013 and 2012. First, investment in research and development continues to support a strong price/value equation in many of the markets that 3M serves. Second, 3M adjusts selling prices to offset currency devaluations in certain developing countries. These increases have more than offset selling price declines in 3M&#146;s optical systems business, where prices typically decline each year, which is common for the electronics industry. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2012, organic local-currency sales increased 2.6 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth was led by Latin America/Canada and the United States, while Asia Pacific was flat, and EMEA was down slightly. Worldwide or ganic local-currency sales grew 5.2 percent in Industrial, 4.7 percent in Health Care, 3.6 percent in Consumer, and 2.4 percent in Safety and Graphics. Organic local-currency sales declined 3.7 percent in Electronics and Energy. Acquisitions added 0.8 percent to worldwide growth and foreign currency translation reduced 2012 worldwide sales growth by 2.4 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to the sections entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; and &#147;Performance by Geographic Area&#148; later in MD&#38;A for additional discussion of sales change. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Percent of net sales) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2013 Versus 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 Versus 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n52.1 \n\n% \n\n52.4 \n\n% \n\n53.0 \n\n% \n\n(0.3 \n\n)% \n\n(0.6 \n\n)% \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n20.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n20.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n20.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4 \n\n) \n\nResearch, development and related expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n5.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n21.6 \n\n% \n\n21.7 \n\n% \n\n20.9 \n\n% \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\n0.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPension and postretirement expense decreased $97 million in 2013 compared to 2012, compared to an increase of $95 million for 2012 compared to 2011. 2012 includes a $26 million charge related to the first-quarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program (discussed in Note 10). Pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A); and research, development and related expenses (R&#38;D). Refer to Note 10 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 52.1 percent in 2013, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from 2012. Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices rose 0.9 percent and raw material cost deflation was approximately 2 percent favorable year-on-year. In addition, lower pension and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales), in addition to organic volume increases, decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of 2012 acquisitions and lower factory utilization. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 52.4 percent in 2012, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points from 2011. The net impact of selling price/raw material cost changes was the primary factor that decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales, as selling prices increased 1.4 percent and raw material costs decreased approximately 2 percent. This benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A) increased $282 million, or 4.6 percent, in 2013 when compared to 2012. In 2013, SG&#38;A included strategic investments in business transformation, enabled by 3M&#146;s global enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation, in addition to increases from acquired businesses that were largely not in 3M&#146;s 2012 spending (Ceradyne, Inc. and Federal Signal Technologies), which were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense. SG&#38;A, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.3 percentage points to 20.7 percent in 2013, compared to 20.4 percent in 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nSG&#38;A decreased $68 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2012 when compared to 2011. In addition to cost-control and other productivity efforts, 3M experienced some savings from its first-quarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program and other restructuring actions. These benefits more than offset increases related to acquisitions, higher year-on-year pension and postretirement expense, and restructuring expenses. SG&#38;A in 2012 included increases from acquired businesses which were not in 3M&#146;s full-year 2011 base spending, primarily related to the 2011 acquisitions of Winterthur Technologie AG and the do-it-yourself and professional business of GPI Group, in addition to SG&#38;A spending related to the 2012 acquisitions of Ceradyne, Inc., Federal Signal Technologies Group, and CodeRyte, Inc. SG&#38;A, measured as a percent of sales, was 20.4 percent in 2012, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points when compared to 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&#38;D) increased 4.9 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 4.1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011, as 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives, including more R&#38;D aimed at disruptive innovation. In 2013, increases from acquired businesses that were largely not in 3M&#146;s 2012 spending (primarily Ceradyne, Inc. and Federal Signal Technologies) were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense. In \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012, investments to support key growth initiatives, along with higher pension and postretirement expense, were partially offset by cost-control efforts and savings from 3M&#146;s first-quarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program. R&#38;D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.6 percent in 2013, compared to 5.5 percent in 2012 and 5.3 percent in 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income margins were 21.6 percent in 2013, compared to 21.7 in 2012, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points. Items that reduced operating income margins included a 0.5 percentage point impact from lower factory utilization/productivity, along with a 0.4 percentage point impact from the combination of business transformation, enabled by 3M&#146;s global ERP implementation, along with more R&#38;D aimed at disruptive innovation. The recently enacted medical device excise tax in the U.S., foreign currency effects, acquisition impacts, and other net impacts reduced operating income margins by 0.7 percentage points. These factors were largely offset by items that increased operating income margins, which included a 1.2 percentage point benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. Finally, lower pension/postretirement benefit costs increased operating income margins by 0.3 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income was 21.7 percent of sales in 2012, compared to 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, an improvement of 0.8 percentage points. The improvement was driven by a 1.6 percentage point benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. This was partially offset by increased pension/postretirement benefit costs and acquisition impacts, each of which reduced margins by 0.3 percentage points, and other net impacts, which decreased margins by 0.2 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Expense and Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n(41 \n\n) \n\n(39 \n\n) \n\n(39 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInterest Expense : Interest expense decreased in both 2013 and 2012. The 2013 decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. The 2012 decrease was driven by lower average international debt balances and lower interest rates on U.S. debt. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Income: Interest income was up $2 million when comparing 2013 to 2012, as higher average international cash balances were largely offset by lower average U.S. balances and lower U.S. and international interest rates. In 2012, lower U.S. cash balances and lower interest rates internationally were offset by higher international cash balances and higher interest rates in the U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for Income Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Percent of pre-tax income) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n28.1 \n\n% \n\n29.0 \n\n% \n\n27.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2013 was 28.1 percent, compared to 29.0 percent in 2012, a decrease of 0.9 percentage points, impacted by many factors. Factors that decreased the Company&#146;s effective tax rate included international taxes as a result of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes, the reinstatement of the U.S. research and development credit in 2013, an increase in the domestic manufacturer&#146;s deduction benefit, the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation deductions were previously limited, and other items. Combined, these factors decreased the Company&#146;s effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points. This benefit was partially offset by factors that increased the effective tax rate by 3.1 percentage points, which largely related to adjustments to 3M&#146;s income tax reserves for 2013 when compared to 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2012 was 29.0 percent, compared to 27.8 percent in 2011, an increase of 1.2 percentage points, impacted by many factors. The primary factors that increased the Company&#146;s effective tax rate year-on-year include international taxes, specifically with respect to the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary (which benefited 2011), state income taxes, lower domestic manufacturer&#146;s deduction, and the lapse of the U.S. research and development credit. These and other factors, when compared to 2011, increased the 2012 effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points. Factors that decreased the Company&#146;s effective tax rate year-on-year include international taxes as a \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nresult of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and adjustments to its income tax reserves. These factors, when compared to 2011, decreased the effective tax rate 0.9 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2014 will be approximately 28.0 to 29.0 percent. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 7 for further discussion of income taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which is 3M&#146;s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As of December 31, 2013, 3M&#146;s effective ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited is 75 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $74 million and $103 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $12 million in 2013 and increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $49 million in 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDisclosures relating to 3M&#146;s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 15, effective in the first quarter of 2013, the Company completed a realignment of its business segments to better serve global markets and customers. Segment information presented herein reflects the impacts of these changes for all periods presented. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer. Information related to 3M&#146;s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Organic local-currency sales include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts. Acquisition impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months of the acquisition. The divestiture impacts, if any, foreign currency translation impacts and total sales change are also provided for each business segment. Any references to EMEA relate to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and Unallocated: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to these five operating business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to &#147;Corporate and Unallocated,&#148; which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 15. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $149 million in 2013 when compared to 2012. Of the $149 million decrease in 2013, approximately $127 million was due to lower pension and postretirement benefit expense. The primary items driving the $51 million increase in Corporate and Unallocated in 2012 when compared to 2011 were pension and postretirement expense, as a portion of the 2012 increase in these expenses were not allocated directly to the five operating business segments ($63 million), partially offset by an increase in other environmental insurance receivables, which benefited 2012 by $15 million (as discussed in Note 13). \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Business Segments: \n\n&#160; \n\nAll five business segments, when comparing 2013 to 2012, were impacted by investments in business transformation, which are enabled by 3M&#146;s global ERP implementation, and by higher allocated pension and postretirement benefit expenses. T he implementation of 3M&#146;s ERP system has increased spending in total, and the transition of 3M&#146;s ERP system from the development stage into deployment has also resulted in more ERP costs being borne by the five operating business segments rather than Corporate and Unallocated. This negatively impacted each business segment&#146;s annual 2013 operating income margins by approximately 0.30 percentage points when compared to 2012. 3M&#146;s pension and postretirement benefit expenses declined $97 million when comparing 2013 to 2012; however, $127 million of this reduction was allocated to Corporate and Unallocated, resulting in $30 million of additional expense being absorbed by the five operating business segments in 2013, or a negative year-on-year impact of approximately 0.10 percentage points. Thus, while operating income margins have declined when comparing 2013 to 2012 for all five business segments, on average approximately 0.40 percentage points of this decline relates to the impact of higher ERP implementation expenses and higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses. When comparing 2012 to 2011, operating business segment results reflect $32 million in higher year-on-year pension and postretirement benefit expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following discusses total year results for 2013 compared to 2012, and also discusses 2012 compared to 2011, for each business segment. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial Business (34.3% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,584 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,943 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,629 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n9.0 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n6.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n) \n\n(3.0 \n\n) \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n6.5 \n\n% \n\n3.3 \n\n% \n\n18.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,296 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,236 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,983 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n12.8 \n\n% \n\n15.3 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.7 \n\n% \n\n22.5 \n\n% \n\n20.6 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Industrial segment serves a broad range of markets, such as automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and automotive aftermarket (auto body shops and retail), electronics, appliance, paper and printing, packaging, food and beverage, and construction.

(filtration products), closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2013 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Industrial totaled $10.6 billion, up 6.5 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.6 percent, acquisitions added 3.6 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.7 percent. On an organic local-currency basis, all of Industrial&#146;s businesses experienced positive sales growth in 2013, led by aerospace, automotive OEM, 3M Purification Inc. (filtration products), and industrial adhesives and tapes. Acquisition growth related to the 2012 acquisition of Ceradyne, Inc. (Ceradyne). As disclosed in Note 2, in November 2012, 3M acquired Ceradyne, which is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California. Ceradyne is involved in the development and production of advanced technical ceramics for demanding applications in the automotive, oil and gas, solar, industrial, electronics and defense industries. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeographically, organic local-currency sales increased 8 percent in Latin America/Canada, 5 percent in the United States, 4 percent in EMEA, and 3 percent in Asia Pacific. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income was $2.3 billion in 2013, up 2.7 percent year-on-year. Operating income margins decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 21.7 percent. This decline in margins largely related to the Ceradyne acquisition, which reduced 2013 operating income margins by 0.7 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Industrial totaled $9.9 billion, up 3.3 percent in U.S. dollars.

Acquisitions growth was primarily driven by Winterthur Technologie AG (Winterthur) in the abrasives market, Ceradyne, Inc. (Ceradyne) in the advanced technical ceramics market, and Alpha Beta Enterprise Co. Ltd. (Alpha Beta) in industrial tapes, all of which are discussed further below. On an organic local-currency basis, sales growth was strongest in automotive OEM, aerospace, abrasives and 3M Purification Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeographically, organic local-currency sales increased 8 percent in the United States, 7 percent in Latin America/Canada, 5 percent in Asia Pacific, and 1 percent in EMEA. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income was $2.2 billion in 2012, 12.8 percent higher than 2011, with the primary benefit related to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. Operating income growth was led by the United States. Operating income margins increased by 1.9 percentage points to 22.5 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M continued to invest in its Industrial business. In November 2012, 3M acquired Ceradyne. In March 2011, 3M acquired a controlling interest in Winterthur via completion of a public tender offer. Winterthur, based in Zug, Switzerland, is a leading global supplier of precision grinding technology serving customers in the area of hard-to-grind precision applications in industrial, automotive, aircraft, and cutting tools. In addition, in February 2011, 3M completed its acquisition \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nof the tape-related assets of Alpha Beta, a leading manufacturer of box sealing tape and masking tape headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2005, 3M&#146;s automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of TI&#38;M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&#38;M) for approximately $55 million. TI&#38;M is the parent company of I&#38;T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&#38;T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed I&#38;T&#146;s flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&#38;T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&#38;M, the Company was granted a put option that gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&#38;M to the other investors from whom the Company acquired its 19 percent interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&#38;M investors from whom the Company purchased its shares filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria in January 2007. Through the Austrian bankruptcy process and pursuit of recovery from the bank that held the 3M purchase price paid to the two bankrupt investors, 3M recovered all but an immaterial amount of the remaining investment through October 2013 at which point 3M resolved its remaining claims. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety and Graphics Business (18.3% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,471 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,458 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n% \n\n2.4 \n\n% \n\n5.1 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.1 \n\n) \n\n(2.8 \n\n) \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n% \n\n0.2 \n\n% \n\n12.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,239 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,217 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,237 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n% \n\n(1.6 \n\n)% \n\n8.7 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\n22.3 \n\n% \n\n22.7 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Safety and Graphics segment serves a broad range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of people, facilities and systems.

Organic local-currency sales increased slightly in stationary and office supplies, impacted by continued consolidation trends in the office retail and wholesale market. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales increased 7 percent in Asia Pacific and 3 percent in both Latin America/Canada and the United States. Organic local-currency sales declined 1 percent in EMEA. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer operating income was $945 million, up 0.2 percent from 2012. Operating income margins were 21.3 percent, down slightly from 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 2, in June 2013, 3M completed the sale of the Scientific Anglers and Ross Reels businesses to The Orvis Company, Inc. based in Manchester, Vermont. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Consumer totaled $4.4 billion, up 3.7 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 3.6 percent, acquisitions added 2.0 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.9 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth was led by the consumer health care and construction and home improvement businesses. Organic local-currency sales increased slightly in stationery and office supplies, impacted by continued softness in the office wholesale and retail markets. Acquisition growth was largely due to the October 2011 acquisition of the do-it-yourself and professional business of GPI Group. GPI is a manufacturer and marketer of home improvement products such as tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products and accessories. The addition of GPI&#146;s products expands 3M&#146;s product portfolio in core and complementary categories in the construction and home improvement markets. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales increased 10 percent in Latin America/Canada, and 4 percent in both Asia Pacific and the United States. EMEA organic local-currency sales decreased 2 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer operating income increased 10.3 percent to $943 million. Operating income margins were 21.5 percent, compared to 20.2 percent in 2011, as all businesses and major geographic areas posted operating income increases. Consumer benefited from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, in addition to cost-control efforts. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M&#146;s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M&#146;s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 16. As discussed in Note 16, during the first quarter of 2013, 3M realigned its geographic area structure to include Puerto Rico in the United States rather than in the Latin America/Canada region. Geographic area information presented herein reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of key information and discussion related to 3M&#146;s geographic areas follow: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America/ Canada \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Unallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,151 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,047 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,085 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,611 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n30,871 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n36.1 \n\n% \n\n29.3 \n\n% \n\n22.9 \n\n% \n\n11.7 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n% \n\n4.3 \n\n% \n\n1.5 \n\n% \n\n1.5 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.7 \n\n) \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n7.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.3 \n\n) \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.6 \n\n) \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n% \n\n(0.5 \n\n)% \n\n5.3 \n\n% \n\n2.3 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,210 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,386 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(6 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n6,666 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n14.0 \n\n% \n\n(2.6 \n\n)% \n\n0.4 \n\n% \n\n(3.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor total year 2013, as shown in the preceding table, sales rose 3.2 percent, with organic volume increases of 2.5 percent and selling price increases of 0.9 percent.

Acquisitions increased employment by approximately 2,500 full-time equivalents for 2012. In addition, the other primary factor that increased employment in both years was additions in developing economies to support growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending was $1.665 billion in 2013, compared to $1.484 billion in 2012 and $1.379 billion in 2011. The Company expects 2014 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, as 3M continues to invest in its businesses. In 2013, 3M continued its expansion of manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, including investments in the U.S., China, Germany, and Brazil. This included significant investments across 3M&#146;s many businesses, such as abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, advanced materials, electronics-related, infection prevention, and other businesses. 3M continued its investments in IT systems and infrastructure, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis over the next several years. In addition, 3M is sustaining existing facilities through general maintenance, cost reduction, and compliance efforts. In 2012, 3M expanded manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, particularly with respect to international and emerging market countries. This included investments in China, Turkey and Poland, in addition to investments in Singapore and the U.S. 3M also increased investments in IT systems and infrastructure and made strategic investments in research/development infrastructure and manufacturing sites to lay the foundation for future growth. In 2011, a large portion of the capital investment was used to address supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. In addition, certain 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is striving to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capacity in developing economies in order to more closely align its production capability with its sales in major geographic regions. The initiative is expected to help improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements. 3M will continue to make investments in critical emerging markets, such as China, Brazil, Poland and India, including plans to establish and begin production in a new wholly-owned manufacturing entity in India to serve as a source of supply to 3M&#146;s business in India and in other countries. \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company&#146;s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLegal Proceedings: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled &#147;Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings&#148; (contained in &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; in Note 13) for additional information about such estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation &#151; Retirement Benefits , in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders&#146; equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant&#146;s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. See Note 10 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.98% for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan and 4.83% for U.S. postretirement plans to be appropriate as of December 31, 2013, which represents an increase from the 4.14% and 4.00% rates, respectively, used as of December 31, 2012. The weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of December 31, 2013 was 4.02%, an increase from the 3.78% rate used as of December 31, 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nA significant element in determining the Company&#146;s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2014 is 7.75%, a 0.25% decrease from 2013. Refer to Note 10 for information on how the 2014 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.83% for 2014, compared to 5.87% for 2013. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $553 million, down from $650 million in 2012. Defined benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to decrease to $393 million in 2014, a decrease of $160 million compared to 2013. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease/increase 2014 pension expense by approximately $34 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $14 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2014 pension expense by approximately $41 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $21 million for international pension plans. In addition, a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2014 pension expense by approximately $42 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $24 million for international pension plans. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsset Impairments: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.7 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. 3M&#146;s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. \n\n&#160; \n\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Notes 3 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2013, 3M completed a realignment of its business segments. Concurrent with this business segment realignment, certain products were also moved between business segments. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2013 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2013, 3M had 34 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 80 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M Purification Inc., Personal Safety, Optical Systems, Traffic Safety and Security Systems, Infection Prevention, 3M ESPE, Advanced Materials, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Communication Markets, and Health Information Systems. The fair values for all significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by 50 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $300 million of goodwill, where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2013, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management&#146;s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. \n\n&#160; \n\nBased on fourth-quarter 2013 testing, 3M&#146;s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately $94 billion, implying a control premium of 17 percent when compared to 3M&#146;s market value of approximately $80 billion at September 30, 2013. The control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3M&#146;s total Company estimated fair value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total Company. 3M&#146;s market value at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $18 billion. 3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M&#146;s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M&#146;s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M&#146;s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2013, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. \n\n&#160; \n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2013, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nthe Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2014 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe extent of 3M&#146;s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 7 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company&#146;s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company&#146;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. \n\n&#160; \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand, U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. 3M resumed commercial paper funding in July 2013 for the first time since late 2008. 3M expects to maintain a consistent presence in the market and believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M&#146;s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At both of December 31, 2013 and 2012, 3M&#146;s outstanding commercial paper balance was zero. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has sufficient liquidity and generates significant ongoing cash flow, which have been used, in part, to repurchase shares and to pay dividends on 3M common stock. In addition, 3M&#146;s liquidity and cash flow enable it to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including funds for capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. As discussed in Note 2, in 2012 3M acquired Ceradyne, Inc. and other acquisitions for approximately $1.0 billion. In 2011, 3M acquired Winterthur Technologie AG and other acquisitions for approximately $700 million (including purchases of noncontrolling interest). 3M was able to complete these acquisitions while maintaining a strong net debt position, as shown in the table below. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31 (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,009 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,001 \n\n&#160; \n\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; \n\n4,790 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,693 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,219 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations. This measure is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2013, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries and in the United States totaled approximately $4.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. The United States balance and 62 percent of cash and securities held by the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. denominated cash or cash equivalents or U.S. denominated investments in money market funds, asset-backed securities, agency securities, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ncorporate medium-term note securities and other investment-grade fixed income securities, which aggregated to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2012, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries and the United States totaled approximately $3.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The Company&#146;s total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $0.9 billion lower at December 31, 2013 when compared to December 31, 2012. 3M is able to manage the business with lower cash levels, particularly in the U.S., due to continued business growth and consistently strong cash flow generation. In addition, rising interest rates are positively impacting 3M&#146;s already well-funded pension status, thereby enabling the Company to reduce the amount of discretionary contributions to the plans. 3M is planning for added leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion in 2014 as it continues to improve the efficiency of its capital structure. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s net debt at December 31, 2013 was $1.219 billion, compared to net debt of $308 million at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, 3M had $4.790 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $6.009 billion of debt. Debt included $4.326 billion of long-term debt and $1.683 billion related to the current portion of long-term debt and other borrowings. The current portion of long-term debt includes a Eurobond due in July 2014 totaling 1.025 billion Euros ($1.424 billion carrying value at December 31, 2013). In August 2013, 3M repaid $850 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. In November 2013, 3M issued an eight-year Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros (approximately $815 million carrying value at December 31, 2013). The designated use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes. The strength of 3M&#146;s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3M reliable access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company&#146;s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn September 2012, 3M entered into a $1.5 billion, five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, which amended the existing agreement that was entered into in August 2011. This amended agreement extended the expiration date from August 2016 to September 2017. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $500 million, bringing the total facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders&#146; discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2013. In August 2013, 3M entered into a $150 million, one-year committed letter of credit facility with HSBC Bank USA, which replaced the one-year $150 million committed credit facility that was entered into in August 2012. As of December 31, 2013, 3M letters of credit issued under this $150 million committed facility totaled $120 million. In December 2012, 3M entered into a three-year 66 million British Pound (approximately $106 million based on agreement date exchange rates) committed credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, which is fully drawn as of December 31, 2013. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $51 million in stand-alone letters of credit was also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2013. The Company also utilized $1 million in international committed lines of credit and $10 million in U.S. committed lines of credit with other banking partners as of December 31, 2013. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities. Under both the $1.5 billion and $150 million credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2013, this ratio was approximately 55 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has a &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; shelf registration statement, effective August 5, 2011, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. This replaced 3M&#146;s previous shelf registration dated February 17, 2009. In September 2011, in connection with the August 5, 2011 shelf registration statement, 3M established a $3 billion medium-term notes program (Series F), from which 3M issued a five-year $1.0 billion fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 1.375%. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment in November 2011 of $800 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. In June 2012, 3M issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2017 with a coupon rate of 1.000% and $600 million aggregate principal amount of ten-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2.000%, which were both issued from this $3 billion medium-term notes program (Series F). The designated use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes. \n\n&#160; \n\nSources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and 3M&#146;s reliable access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, in addition to funding U.S. acquisitions, U.S. capital spending, U.S. pension/other postemployment benefit contributions, and other items as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate them. Refer to Note 7 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2014, the Company plans to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its pension and postretirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2014. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. qualified plans&#146; funded status as of the 2014 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.730 billion in 2013, and has a long history of dividend increases. In December 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors declared a dividend of 85.5 cents per share for the first-quarter of 2014, an increase of 34.6 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.42 per share and marked the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. In February 2014, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $12 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company&#146;s February 2013 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $2.5 billion remained available under the February 2013 repurchase authorization. \n\n&#160; \n\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $5.235 billion at December 31, 2013, compared with $7.430 billion at December 31, 2012, a decrease of approximately $2.2 billion. Factors which reduced working capital on a combined basis by $2.4 billion included decreases in cash, cash equivalents, and current marketable securities, along with increases in the current portion of long term debt (which is a component of short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt) and increases in other current liabilities, largely related to the dividend declared in December 2013 that will not be paid until March 2014 (discussed in Note 5). This was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of approximately $0.2 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales &#151; fourth quarter at year-end &#151; multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 4.8 at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Receivables increased $192 million, or 4.7 percent, compared with December 31, 2012, driven by a year-on-year increase in December sales, partially offset by currency translation, which decreased accounts receivable by $135 million. Inventories increased $27 million, or 1 percent, compared with December 31, 2012, with the increases primarily attributable to an increase in demand in the fourth-quarter of 2013, partially offset by currency translation, which decreased inventories by $75 million. Accounts payable increased $37 million compared with December 31, 2012, primarily related to changes in business activity, which were partially offset by a $29 million decrease due to currency translation. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income including noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,721 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,511 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,357 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n1,371 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,288 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,236 \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany pension contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(476 \n\n) \n\n(1,079 \n\n) \n\n(517 \n\n) \n\nCompany postretirement contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n) \n\n(67 \n\n) \n\n(65 \n\n) \n\nCompany pension expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany postretirement expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n(92 \n\n) \n\n(62 \n\n) \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\nAccounts receivable \n\n&#160; \n\n(337 \n\n) \n\n(133 \n\n) \n\n(205 \n\n) \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n(86 \n\n) \n\n(251 \n\n) \n\n(196 \n\n) \n\nAccounts payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(83 \n\n) \n\nProduct and other insurance receivables and claims \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOther &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n(167 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(139 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,817 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,284 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2013, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $517 million compared to 2012. Operating cash flows benefited year-on-year from $664 million of lower pension and postretirement plans contributions and increases in net income including noncontrolling interest, which were partially offset by higher year-on-year working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $407 million in 2013, compared to increases of $312 million in 2012, primarily driven by year-on-year increases in working capital requirements due to increasing sales. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the &#147;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#148; section. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2012, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $16 million compared to 2011. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. 3M was able to achieve this growth in operating cash flow despite contributing an additional $564 million in its pension and postretirement plans when compared to 2011. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $312 million in 2012, compared to increases of $484 million in 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure): \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Capital spending was $1.665 billion in 2013, compared to $1.484 billion in 2012 and $1.379 billion in 2011. The Company expects 2014 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, as 3M continues to invest in its businesses. In 2013, 3M continued its expansion of manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, including investments in the U.S., China, Germany, and Brazil. This included significant investments across 3M&#146;s many businesses, such as abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, advanced materials, electronics-related, infection prevention, and other businesses. 3M continued its investments in IT systems and infrastructure, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis over the next several years. In addition, 3M is sustaining existing facilities through general maintenance, cost reduction, and compliance efforts. In 2012, 3M expanded manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, particularly with respect to international and emerging market countries. This included investments in China, Turkey and Poland, in addition to investments in Singapore and the U.S. 3M also increased investments in IT systems and infrastructure and made strategic investments in research/development infrastructure and manufacturing sites to lay the foundation for future growth. In 2011, a large portion of the capital investment was used to address supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. In addition, certain 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is striving to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capacity, particularly in developing economies, in order to more closely align its production capability with its sales in major geographic regions. The initiative is expected to help improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements. 3M will continue to make investments in critical emerging markets, such as China, Brazil, Poland and India, including plans to establish and begin production in a new wholly-owned manufacturing entity in India to serve as a source of supply to 3M&#146;s business in India and in other countries. \n\n&#160; \n\nProceeds from sale of PP&#38;E and other assets totaled $128 million in 2013 compared to $41 million in 2012. Apart from the normal periodic sales of PP&#38;E, 2013 included proceeds of $79 million related to non-production equipment, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $7 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. The coupon interest rates for asset-backed securities are either fixed rate or floating. Floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly LIBOR rate. Each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective LIBOR rate +/- an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. Terms of the reset are unique to individual securities. Fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond. The spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. Refer to Note 8 for more details about 3M&#146;s diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $2.209 billion as of December 31, 2013. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus cost method and equity investments. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in short-term debt &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nRepayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) \n\n&#160; \n\n(859 \n\n) \n\n(612 \n\n) \n\n(1,429 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,370 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,111 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal cash change in debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(37 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(307 \n\n) \n\nPurchases of treasury stock \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,212 \n\n) \n\n(2,204 \n\n) \n\n(2,701 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from issuances of treasury stock pursuant to stock option and benefit plans \n\n&#160; \n\n1,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,012 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDividends paid to stockholders \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,730 \n\n) \n\n(1,635 \n\n) \n\n(1,555 \n\n) \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n(67 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(5,246 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,058 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(3,675 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nTotal debt was $6.0 billion at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, compared to $5.2 billion at year-end 2011. Total debt was 25 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2013, 2012 and 2011. In 2013, repayment of debt related to the August 2013 repayment of $850 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. Proceeds from debt in 2013 related to the November 2013 issuance of an eight-year Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros (approximately $815 million carrying value at December 31, 2013). In 2012, repayment of debt included $500 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes and repayment of debt acquired, primarily Ceradyne, Inc. Proceeds from debt in 2012 related to the June 2012 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2017 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of ten-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2022, in addition to 66 million GBP (approximately $106 million) in UK borrowings (refer to Note 9 for further detail on these items). In 2011, major items in repayment of debt included redemption of $800 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes in November 2011, redemption of Convertible Notes, repayment of debt related to the 11.6 billion Japanese Yen note (installments paid in March and September 2011), repayment of the remainder of the Canadian Dollar loan, and repayment of a portion of debt that was acquired, primarily related to the Winterthur acquisition. In 2011, proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) primarily related to the issuance of a $1 billion medium term note and an amendment to a Canada loan agreement which increased the principal amount of the loan by 100.5 million Canadian Dollars. \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company&#146;s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2014, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $12 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company&#146;s February 2013 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2013, the Company purchased $5.212 billion of stock, up significantly from $2.204 billion in 2012 and $2.701 billion in 2011. The Company expects full-year 2014 gross share repurchases will be in the range of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion. 3M is increasing share purchases, which is enabled by its continued business growth and consistently strong cash flow, the well-funded status of its pension plans, and the strength of the Company&#146;s capital structure. For more information, refer to the table titled &#147;Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148; in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company&#146;s stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $1.730 billion ($2.54 per share) in 2013, $1.635 billion ($2.36 per share) in 2012 and $1.555 billion ($2.20 per share) in 2011. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In December 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2014 dividend of $0.855 per share, an increase of 34.6 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.42 per share and marked the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to the items described below, other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2011, as discussed in Note 5, subsequent to acquiring a controlling interest in Winterthur, 3M purchased additional outstanding shares of its Winterthur subsidiary for $57 million, increasing 3M&#146;s ownership interest from approximately 86 percent to 100 percent as of December 31, 2011. These additional purchases are reflected as other financing activities in the statement of cash flows. In addition, during 2011, 3M sold a noncontrolling interest in a newly formed subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Warranties/Guarantees&#148; in Note 13 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M&#146;s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of the Company&#146;s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments due by year \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt, including current portion (Note 9) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,912 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,586 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,501 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest on long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n1,615 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,063 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases (Note 13) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital leases (Note 13) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations and other \n\n&#160; \n\n1,428 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual cash obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,882 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,988 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,327 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,837 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nLong-term debt payments due in 2014 and 2017 include floating rate notes totaling $156 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt) and $71 million (included in other borrowings in the long-term debt table), respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company&#146;s expected capital spending in 2014 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M&#146;s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled &#147;Unconditional purchase obligations and other,&#148; include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $179 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 7 for further details. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 10, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2014 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Item 7A, &#147;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#148;, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 210, "Negative": 192, "Polarity": 0.04477611929160169, "Subjectivity": 0.0476642162618373}, "similarity_score": 0.9931131536871275, "nlp_result": 0.010699961395537267}
