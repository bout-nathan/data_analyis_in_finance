" ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") is intended to help the reader understand The Coca-Cola Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to &#8212; and should be read in conjunction with &#8212; our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&#38;A, which includes the following sections: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOur Business &#8212; a general description of our business and the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#8212; a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperations Review &#8212; an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. Except to the extent that differences among our operating segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion in the MD&#38;A on a consolidated basis. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; an analysis of cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations; foreign exchange; the impact of inflation and changing prices; and an overview of financial position. \n\n##TABLE_END &#32;29 \n\nOur Business \n\nGeneral \n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. \n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers &#8212; the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 1.9 billion of the approximately 57 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day. \n\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. \n\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets &#8212; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#8212; to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. \n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nbeverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate business\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfinished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product operations\"). \n\n##TABLE_END Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. \n\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers &#8212; such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles &#8212; bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\nOur finished product operations consist primarily of Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, including CCR. Our Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, other than CCR, are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. CCR is included in our North America operating segment. Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. \n\n&#32;30 \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n2012 \n\nConcentrate operations 1 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nFinished product operations 2 \n\n62 \n\nNet operating revenues \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n2012 \n\nConcentrate operations 1 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nFinished product operations 2 \n\n30 \n\nTotal worldwide unit case volume \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe Nonalcoholic Beverage Segment of the Commercial Beverage Industry \n\nWe operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. \n\nOur Objective \n\nOur objective is to use our formidable assets &#8212; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#8212; to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPeople: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPortfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people's desires and needs. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPartners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPlanet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProfit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProductivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. \n\n##TABLE_END &#32;31 \n\nStrategic Priorities \n\nWe have the following five strategic priorities designed to create long-term sustainable growth for our Company and the \n\nCoca-Cola system and value for our shareowners: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAccelerate sparkling growth, led by brand Coca-Cola \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStrategically expand our profitable still portfolio \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncrease media investments by maximizing productivity \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWin at the point of sale by unlocking the power of the Coca-Cola system \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInvest in our next generation of leaders \n\n##TABLE_END To enable the entire Coca-Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; franchise leadership; and bottling and distribution operations. \n\nCore Capabilities \n\nConsumer Marketing \n\nMarketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of, and increase consumer preference for, our brands. Successful marketing investments produce long-term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions. \n\nWe have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs, but generally at a slower rate than gross profit growth. \n\nWe are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment. \n\nCommercial Leadership \n\nThe Coca-Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customer's business and needs &#8212; whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. \n\nFranchise Leadership \n\nWe must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Company's success. We work with our bottling partners to identify processes that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca-Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. \n\n&#32;32 \n\nBottling and Distribution Operations \n\nMost of our Company beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independent bottling partners. However, we often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. \n\nOur Company has a long history of providing world-class customer service, demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce. In addition, we have an experienced bottler management team. All of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations. \n\nThe Company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business. This includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers. As we further transform the way we go to market, the Company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient. \n\nChallenges and Risks \n\nBeing global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our Company. Of these, six key challenges and risks are discussed below. \n\nObesity, Poor Diets and Inactive Lifestyles \n\nThe rates of obesity affecting communities, cultures and countries worldwide continue to be too high. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity, which results from poor diets that are too high in calories combined with inactive lifestyles. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand and recognize that obesity is a complex public health challenge and are committed to being a part of the solution. \n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers&#8217; lifestyles and dietary choices. All of our products can be part of an active, healthy lifestyle that includes a sensible and balanced diet, proper hydration and regular physical activity. However, when it comes to weight management, all calories count, whatever food or beverage they come from, including calories from our beverages. \n\nThe following four global initiatives will guide our efforts to address obesity and bring people together to pursue solutions: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOffer low- or no-calorie beverage options \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProvide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of all of our packages \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHelp get people moving by supporting physical activity programs \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMarket responsibly, including no advertising to children under 12 \n\n##TABLE_END We recognize the health of our business is interwoven with the well-being of our consumers, our employees and the communities we serve, and we are working in cooperation with governments, educators and consumers. \n\nWater Quality and Quantity \n\nWater quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Company&#8217;s attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to our manufacturing processes and is needed to produce the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Today, water is a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, flourishing food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. \n\nOur Company has a robust water stewardship and management program and continues to work to improve water use efficiency, treat wastewater prior to discharge and to achieve our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We regularly assess the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are actively collaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world. We are working with our global partners to develop and implement sustainability-related water projects. We are encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system. Through these integrated programs, we believe that our Company is in an excellent position to leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve &#8212; through source water availability assessments, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and partners \n\n&#32;33 \n\nin addressing water and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial to the successful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource. \n\nEvolving Consumer Preferences \n\nConsumers want more choices. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands and throughout our portfolio with a focus on low- and no-calorie products, innovative packaging, and ingredient and packaging material education efforts. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs, desires and lifestyles. \n\nIncreased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace \n\nOur Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we strategically expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. \n\nProduct Safety and Quality \n\nAs the world's largest beverage company, we strive to meet the highest of standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. Our system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with the world. We have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences. Across the Coca-Cola system, we take great care in an effort to ensure that every one of our beverages meets the highest standards for safety and quality. \n\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management system also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace. \n\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries where our products are sold. We consistently reassess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain. \n\nFood Security \n\nIncreased demand for commodities and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. We are dedicated to implementing our sustainable sourcing commitment, which is founded on principles that protect the environment, uphold workplace rights and help build more sustainable communities. To support this commitment, our programs focus on economic opportunity, with an emphasis on female farmers, and environmental sustainability designed to help address these agricultural challenges. Through joint efforts with farmers, communities, bottlers, suppliers and key partners, as well as our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, we can together help make a positive strategic impact on food security. \n\nAll of these challenges and risks &#8212; obesity, poor diets and inactive lifestyles; water quality and quantity; evolving consumer preferences; increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace; product safety and quality; and food security &#8212; have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. \n\nSee also ''Item 1A. Risk Factors'' in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. \n\n&#32;34 \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRecoverability of Noncurrent Assets \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n##TABLE_END Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 2,171 million &#32;and $ 1,776 million &#32;as of December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 , respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 284 million &#32;and $ 234 million &#32;as of December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 , respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. \n\n&#32;35 \n\nRecoverability of Noncurrent Assets \n\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. \n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statements of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. \n\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. Certain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. \n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging markets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#8212; Challenges and Risks\" above and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. \n\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities \n\nThe carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are carried at fair value if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. \n\n&#32;36 \n\nThe following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2013 \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage \n\nof Total \n\nAssets 1 \n\nEquity method investments \n\n$ \n\n10,393 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSecurities classified as available-for-sale \n\n4,842 \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurities classified as trading \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nCost method investments \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n15,769 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nAccounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. \n\n##TABLE_END 1 The total percentage does not add due to rounding. \n\nInvestments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. \n\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nIn 2013, four of the Company's Japanese bottling partners merged as Coca-Cola East Japan Bottling Company, Ltd. (\"CCEJ\"), a publicly traded entity, through a share exchange. The terms of the agreement included the issuance of new shares of one of the publicly traded bottlers in exchange for 100 percent &#32;of the outstanding shares of the remaining three bottlers according to an agreed-upon share exchange ratio. As a result, the Company recorded a net charge of $114 million &#32;for those investments in which the Company's carrying value was less than the fair value of the shares received. These charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below as well as Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2012, the Company recognized impairment charges of $16 million as a result of the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values of certain cost method investments. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below as well as Note 16 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2011, the Company recognized impairment charges of $17 million as a result of the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values of certain available-for-sale securities. In addition, the Company recognized charges of $41 million during 2011 related to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below as well as Note 16 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#32;37 \n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2013 \n\nFair \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nDifference \n\nCoca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. \n\n$ \n\n7,098 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,247 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,851 \n\nCoca-Cola Amatil Limited \n\n2,459 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,605 \n\nCoca-Cola HBC AG \n\n2,429 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,467 \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola &#304;&#231;ecek A.&#350;. \n\n1,324 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,091 \n\nCoca-Cola East Japan Bottling Company, Ltd. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmbotelladora Andina S.A. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co.

Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers for distribution rights as well as to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets (or asset groups) may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was $ 14,967 million , or 17 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment review is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. \n\n&#32;38 \n\nThe following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2013 \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage \n\nof Total \n\nAssets 1 \n\nGoodwill \n\n$ \n\n12,312 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives \n\n7,415 \n\n&#160; \n\nTrademarks with indefinite lives \n\n6,744 \n\n&#160; \n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, net \n\n&#160; \n\nOther intangible assets not subject to amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n27,611 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nAccounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. \n\n##TABLE_END 1 The total percentage does not add due to rounding. \n\nWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group), we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \n\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, prior to completing the impairment test described above. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment. During 2013 , the Company performed qualitative assessments on less than 10 percent &#32;of our indefinite-lived intangible assets balance. \n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as \"business units.\" These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. \n\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to completing the two-step process described above to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step process. Otherwise, the Company will forego the two-step process and does not need to perform any further testing. \n\n&#32;39 \n\nDuring 2013 , the Company performed qualitative assessments on approximately 11 percent &#32;of our consolidated goodwill balance. \n\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. \n\nDuring 2013, the Company recorded charges of $195 million &#32;related to certain intangible assets. These charges included $113 million related to the impairment of trademarks recorded in our Bottling Investments and Pacific operating segments. These impairments were primarily due to a strategic decision to phase out certain local-market brands, which resulted in a change in the expected useful life of the intangible assets, and were determined by comparing the fair value of the trademarks, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to the current carrying value. Additionally, the remaining charge of $82 million related to goodwill recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was primarily the result of management's revised outlook on market conditions and volume performance. The total impairment charges of $195 million &#32;were recorded in our Corporate operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income. \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , we did not have any reporting unit with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that it will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. However, if macroeconomic conditions worsen, it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets, which would require us to recognize impairment charges. On June 7, 2007, our Company acquired Energy Brands Inc., also known as glac&#233;au, for approximately $4.1 billion. The Company allocated $3.3 billion of the purchase price to various trademarks acquired in this business combination. While the combined fair value of the various trademarks acquired in this transaction significantly exceeds their combined carrying values as of December 31, 2013, the fair value of one trademark within the portfolio only slightly exceeds its carrying value. If the future operating results of this trademark do not achieve the current near-term financial projections or if macroeconomic conditions change causing the cost of capital and/or discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an impairment charge related to this trademark. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods. \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\nOur Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. \n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation. \n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 , the weighted-average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was 4.75 percent &#32;and 4.00 percent , respectively. \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long-term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our pension expense was 8.25 percent &#32;in 2013 and 2012. \n\n&#32;40 \n\nIn 2013 , the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $197 million . In 2014, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $32 million. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligation, favorable asset performance during 2013 and the approximately $175 million of contributions the Company expects to make in 2014 to its international plans. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2014 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $37 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on our 2014 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $31 million. \n\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company's primary U.S. plan represented 57 percent &#32;and 63 percent &#32;of the Company's consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. \n\nOur customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $ 6.9 billion , $ 6.1 billion &#32;and $ 5.8 billion &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Income Taxes\" below and Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. \n\nTax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create \n\n&#32;41 \n\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. \n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $ 586 million &#32;and primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. As of December 31, 2013 , undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $ 30.6 billion . Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 percent in 2014. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2014. \n\nOperations Review \n\nOur organizational structure as of December 31, 2013 , consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as \"operating groups\" or \"groups\": Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements \n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance. \n\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\nOur Bottling Investments operating segment and our other finished product operations, including the finished product operations in our North America operating segment, typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In \n\n&#32;42 \n\naddition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these consolidated finished product operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations, and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\n\"Structural changes\" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling, distribution or canning entities for accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. \n\nThe Company acquired Great Plains Coca-Cola Bottling Company (\"Great Plains\") in December 2011, bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia in February 2012, bottling operations in Guatemala in June 2012, and a majority interest in bottling operations in Myanmar in June 2013. In January 2013, the Company sold a majority interest in our previously consolidated bottling operations in the Philippines (\"Philippine bottling operations\"), and in July 2013 the Company deconsolidated our bottling operations in Brazil (\"Brazilian bottling operations\") as a result of their combination with an independent bottling partner. Accordingly, the impact to net operating revenues related to these acquisitions and dispositions was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nIn January 2012, the Company announced that BPW, our joint venture with Nestl&#233; in the ready-to-drink tea category, refocused its geographic scope primarily on Europe and Canada. The joint venture was phased out in all other territories by the end of 2012, and the Company's agreement to distribute products in the United States under a sublicense from a subsidiary of Nestl&#233; terminated at the end of 2012. The impact to net operating revenues for North America related to the termination of our license agreement has been included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. In addition, we have eliminated the BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed unit case volume and associated concentrate sales for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , in those countries impacted by these structural changes. We have also eliminated the BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed unit case volume and associated concentrate sales from the base year, where applicable, when calculating 2012 versus 2011 volume growth rates. Refer to the headings \"Beverage Volume\" and \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nThe Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for the unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit and the associated concentrate sales volume related to these transactions until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. \n\n\"Acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. \n\nIn 2012, the Company invested in the existing beverage business of Aujan, one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East. The Company now owns 50 percent of the Aujan entity that holds the rights to Aujan-owned brands in certain territories and 49 percent of Aujan's bottling and distribution operations in certain territories. Accordingly, the volume associated with the Aujan transaction, subsequent to our initial equity investment during the second quarter of 2012, is considered to be from acquired brands. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\n&#32;43 \n\n\"License agreements\" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. \n\nBeverage Volume \n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. \n\nInformation about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPercent Change &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2013 vs. 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 vs. 2011 \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\nUnit Cases 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\nConcentrate \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nUnit Cases 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\nConcentrate \n\nSales \n\nWorldwide \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\nLatin America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottling Investments \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nBottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nGeographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nUnit Case Volume \n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 28.2 billion, 27.7 billion and 26.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. The number of unit cases sold in 2012 does not include BPW unit case volume for those countries in which BPW was phased out during 2012, nor does it include unit case volume of products distributed in the United States under a sublicense from a subsidiary of Nestl&#233; which terminated at the end of 2012. In addition, the Company eliminated BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed unit case volume from the base year, where applicable, when calculating 2012 versus 2011 volume growth rates below. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above. \n\n&#32;44 \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 &#32; \n\nIn Eurasia and Africa unit case volume increased 7 percent, which consisted of 6 percent growth in sparkling and 13 percent growth in still beverages. The group's sparkling beverage growth was led by 6 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 5 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 3 percent growth in Trademark Fanta. This growth reflects a continued focus on driving exceptional capabilities in the marketplace, integrated marketing campaigns and greater consumer choice in package and price options. Growth in still beverages was led by packaged water, juices and juice drinks, and teas. Russia reported unit case growth of 3 percent, driven by growth of 11 percent in brand Coca-Cola . Still beverage growth in Russia included growth of 7 percent and 24 percent in our juice brands Dobriy and Rich, respectively. Unit case growth in Russia was favorably impacted by the Company's marketing activities related to the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and Olympic Torch Relay. Eurasia and Africa also benefited from unit case volume growth of 14 percent in the Company's Middle East and North Africa business uni t, including a 5 percent benefit primarily related to our Aujan partnership, and 8 percent growth in the Company's Central, East and West Africa business unit. &#32; \n\nUnit case volume in Europe declined 1 percent, which consisted of a 1 percent decline in sparkling beverages and a 5 percent decline in still beverages, primarily packaged water and teas. These declines reflect the impact of particularly poor weather across many countries during the second quarter of 2013, including severe flooding in parts of Germany and Central Europe, competitive pricing, and ongoing weakness in consumer confidence and spending across the region. In spite of these challenges, our Germany business unit reported growth of 2 percent and our Northwest Europe and Nordics business unit reported growth of 1 percent. This growth was driven by the Company's strong commercial campaigns such as \"Share a Coke,\" \"Coke with Meals,\" and the Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour. These increases were offset by a decline in unit case volume of 4 percent in the Central and Southern Europe business unit and a volume decline of 3 percent in the Iberia business unit which continue to manage through very tough macroeconomic conditions. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 1 percent, which primarily reflects 8 percent growth in still beverages while volume in sparkling beverages was even. The group reported growth of 6 percent in the Latin Center business unit and growth of 4 percent in the South Latin business unit, driven by strong activation of brand and category advertising as well as investments in cold-drink equipment and continued segmentation across multiple price points and package sizes. The group's still beverage growth reflects increases in the tea, packaged water, and juice and juice drink categories of 16 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Argentina reported unit case growth of 7 percent, led by strong growth in Trademark Bonaqua and 5 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola. The growth in the Mexico business unit was even due to a slower economy and the significant disruption caused by hurricanes Manuel and Ingrid in September 2013. Volume in Brazil declined 2 percent, which reflects some consumer uncertainty given the economic slowdown in the country. Effective January 1, 2014, the Mexican government implemented a new tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. We believe that this tax will have a negative impact on our 2014 volume. \n\nUnit case volume in North America was even reflecting overall category softness, unseasonably cold and wet weather during the second quarter of 2013 and weak consumer confidence, which negatively impacted consumer spending. Sparkling beverages declined 2 percent, whereas still beverages grew 5 percent during the period. Still beverage growth in North America was led by strong performance in teas, juices and juice drinks and packaged water. The group continued to implement a multi-brand strategy around teas and reported 15 percent volume growth, primarily due to increases in Gold Peak, Honest Tea and Fuze. Volume growth in juices and juice drinks was 4 percent, led by 7 percent growth in Trademark Simply, and packaged water volume benefited from strong growth in Dasani and smartwater. \n\nIn Pacific, unit case volume increased 3 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 4 percent growth in still beverages. Sparkling beverage growth was led by 5 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola and 4 percent growth in Trademark Fanta. India reported 4 percent unit case volume growth, led by growth of 18 percent in brand Coca-Cola and 5 percent growth in Trademark Sprite. India's growth reflects the impact of strong integrated marketing campaigns and continued expansion of packaging choices to consumers. Japan's unit case growth was 1 percent during the period, including 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages. China reported unit case volume growth of 3 percent, including volume growth of 4 percent in sparkling beverages and 3 percent in still beverages. The group's volume results also benefited from 25 percent growth in Vietnam and 9 percent growth in Thailand, partially offset by declines of 3 percent in the Philippines and 4 percent in Australia. \n\n&#32;45 \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 17 percent. This decrease primarily reflects the sale of a majority ownership interest in our previously consolidated bottling operations in the Philippines to Coca-Cola FEMSA in January 2013, as well as the deconsolidation of our bottling operations in Brazil during July 2013 as a result of their combination with an independent bottling partner. The unfavorable impact of these transactions on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in other key markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations, including unit case volume growth of 3 percent in China, 4 percent in India and 2 percent in Germany. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 35 percent, 65 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and Germany, respectively. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 &#32; \n\nIn Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 10 percent, which consisted of 8 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 19 percent growth in still beverages. The group's sparkling beverage growth was led by 9 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 7 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 6 percent growth in Trademark Fanta. Growth in still beverages was primarily due to juices and juice drinks and included a 10 percentage point benefit attributable to acquired volume, primarily related to our investments in Aujan. Russia reported unit case volume growth of 8 percent, driven by growth of 20 percent in brand Coca-Cola. Still beverage growth in Russia included growth of 13 percent and 23 percent in our juice brands Dobriy and Rich, respectively. Eurasia and Africa also benefited from unit case volume growth of 21 percent in the Company's Middle East and North Africa business unit, including a 9 percentage point benefit attributable to acquired volume, primarily related to our investments in Aujan. South Africa had unit case volume growth of 6 percent, reflecting our increased marketing initiatives in 2012 and the impact of the volume decline reported in 2011 due to unfavorable weather conditions and higher pricing. \n\nUnit case volume in Europe declined 1 percent, which consisted of a 2 percent decline in sparkling beverages and minimal growth in still beverages. Germany reported unit case volume growth of 1 percent, reflecting the Company's strong commercial campaigns such as our 2012 Olympic Games partnership and the Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour, music-themed integrated marketing campaigns and a continued focus on low-calorie and no-calorie sparkling beverages. The favorable impact of growth in Germany was more than offset by volume declines in other markets. The group reported a decline in unit case volume of 3 percent in the Northwest Europe and Nordics business unit and a volume decline of 1 percent in the Iberia business unit, reflecting the challenges of continued weak consumer confidence, adverse weather and aggressive competitive pricing. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 12 percent growth in still beverages. The growth reported across Latin America was driven by continued investments in our brands, strong activation of holiday programming, and a continued focus on a differentiated occasion-based package, price and channel strategy. The group's growth in sparkling beverages was led by 3 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 6 percent growth in Trademark Fanta and 5 percent growth in Trademark Sprite. Still beverage growth in Latin America reflected 34 percent growth in teas as a result of the newly launched Fuze Tea, 28 percent growth in sports drinks, 9 percent growth in packaged water and 12 percent growth in juices and juice drinks. Brazil reported unit case volume growth of 6 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 11 percent growth in Trademark Fanta and 16 percent growth in still beverages. Latin America also benefited from unit case volume growth of 4 percent in Mexico and 7 percent growth in Argentina. \n\nUnit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, led by growth of 8 percent in still beverages. Still beverage growth in North America included 16 percent growth in teas, 12 percent growth in sports drinks, 9 percent growth in packaged water and 2 percent growth in juices and juice drinks. The group reported 11 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, reflecting the benefit of a strong 2012 Olympic Games activation. Growth in teas included the continued strong growth of Gold Peak, and the group's juices and juice drinks benefited from 7 percent growth in Trademark Simply. Dasani had unit case volume growth of 10 percent and maintained its premium pricing position, supported by our PET packaging. The group's growth in still beverages was partially offset by a volume decline of 1 percent in sparkling beverages. Although overall sparkling beverage volume declined in North America, the group benefited from growth in Coca-Cola Zero and Trademark Fanta of 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively. \n\nIn Pacific, unit case volume increased 7 percent, which consisted of 5 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 9 percent growth in still beverages. The group's volume results included 4 percent growth in China, despite the impact of an economic slowdown in the country, extremely wet weather in July and August and the shift in timing of the 2013 Chinese New Year. Sparkling beverage growth in China was led by growth of 21 percent in Trademark Fanta. Still beverage growth in China was primarily due to volume growth in packaged water. Japan's unit case volume increased 2 percent, which included a 3 percent increase in still beverages, partially offset by a 2 percent decline in sparkling beverages. Still beverages in Japan benefited primarily from growth in the Company's ready-to-drink tea and coffee categories. In addition, India reported 16 percent unit case volume growth, reflecting the impact of strong integrated marketing campaigns, and primarily consisted of 33 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 20 percent growth in Trademark Sprite, 13 percent growth in Trademark Thums Up and 26 percent growth in our Maaza juice drink brand. The Pacific group also benefited from unit case volume growth of 22 percent in Thailand, 20 percent in South Korea and 5 percent in the Philippines. \n\n&#32;46 \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 10 percent. The group had growth in key markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations, including unit case volume growth of 4 percent in China, 16 percent in India, 5 percent in the Philippines and 1 percent in Germany. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 34 percent, 65 percent, 100 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India, the Philippines and Germany, respectively. The group's volume growth included a benefit of 3 percentage points attributable to the acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala during the year ended December 31, 2012. \n\nConcentrate Sales Volume \n\nIn 2013 , concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 2 percent compared to 2012 . Likewise, in 2012 , concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 4 percent compared to 2011 . The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for individual operating segments in 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. \n\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations. The size and timing of structural changes are not consistent from period to period. As a result, anticipating the impact of such events on future net operating revenues, and other financial statement line items, usually is not possible. We expect structural changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. \n\nGross Profit Margin \n\nAs a result of our finished goods operations, which are primarily included in our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments, the following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The Company increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures, including any related foreign currency exposure, do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded losses of $120 million, $110 million and $54 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively, in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not currently expect changes in commodity costs to have a significant impact on our 2014 gross profit margin as compared to 2013. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 \n\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.7 percent in 2013 from 60.3 percent in 2012. The increase is partially due to the deconsolidation of our Philippine bottling operations in January 2013 and the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above for additional information regarding the impact of the deconsolidation of our Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 \n\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 60.3 percent in 2012 from 60.9 percent in 2011. This decrease reflected the unfavorable impact of continued increases in commodity costs during 2012 as well as temporary shifts in channel and package mix across markets as a result of the impact of global economic conditions on consumers. In addition, our gross profit margin was unfavorably impacted as a result of ongoing fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of our acquisition of Great Plains in North America as well as our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable geographic mix as well as price increases in many of our key markets. \n\nThe cost to purchase the inputs listed above continued to increase in 2012 when compared to 2011, and as a result the Company incurred incremental costs of $225 million related to these inputs during 2012. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity. \n\n&#32;50 \n\nThe favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" above. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nAdvertising expenses \n\n3,266 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,342 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,256 \n\nBottling and distribution expenses \n\n8,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,905 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,502 \n\nOther operating expenses \n\n5,307 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,232 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,310 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n$ \n\n17,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,422 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $428 million, or 2 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 1 percent. The decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily due to reversals in 2013 of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive compensation programs. As a result of the Company's revised outlook, including the unfavorable impact foreign currency fluctuations are projected to have on certain performance periods, the Company lowered the estimated payouts associated with these periods. Advertising expenses were impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies, primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in-store activations, loyalty points programs and point-of-sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net operating revenues instead of marketing expenses. The decrease in bottling and distribution expenses includes the impact of the Company's sale of a majority interest in our previously consolidated Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA in January 2013 and the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations as a result of their combination with an independent bottling partner in July 2013, partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala and the United States in 2012. \n\nIn 2014, our pension expense is expected to decrease by approximately $165 million compared to 2013. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligation, favorable asset performance during 2013 and the approximately $175 million of contributions expected to be made by the Company to our international plans. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\" below for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#8212; Pension Plan Valuations\" above and Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the discount rates used by the Company. \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , we had $ 416 million &#32;of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $316 million, or 2 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3 percent. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense in 2012 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive compensation programs. As a result of the Company's revised outlook of the unfavorable impact foreign currency fluctuations are projected to have on certain performance periods, the Company lowered the estimated payouts associated with these periods. Advertising expenses increased during the year and reflect the Company's continued investment in the health and strength of our brands and building market execution capabilities while simultaneously capturing incremental marketing efficiencies. The increase in bottling and distribution expenses includes the full year impact of the Company's acquisition of Great Plains in December 2011 as well as our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala during 2012. Other operating expenses decreased during the year, partially reflecting the impact of the Company's productivity and integration initiatives. \n\n&#32;51 \n\nOther Operating Charges \n\nOther operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nEurope \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottling Investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2013, the Company incurred other operating charges of $ 895 million , which primarily consisted of $494 million &#32;associated with the Company's productivity and reinvestment program; $195 million &#32;due to the impairment of certain intangible assets; $188 million &#32;due to the Company's other productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives; and $22 million &#32;due to charges associated with certain of the Company's fixed assets.

These charges were partially offset by reversals of $ 10 million &#32;associated with the refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's 2008&#8211;2011 productivity initiatives, as well as reversals of $ 6 million &#32;associated with the refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's integration of CCE's former North America business.

Refer Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the discussion of the Japan events and merger of Arca and Contal. Refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments. \n\nProductivity and Reinvestment Program \n\nIn February 2012, the Company announced a four-year productivity and reinvestment program. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first component of this program is a global productivity initiative that will target annualized savings of $350 million to $400 million. This initiative will be focused on four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; and data and information technology systems standardization. The second component of our productivity and reinvestment program involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The Company has identified incremental synergies, primarily in the area of our North American product supply operations, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. We believe these efforts will create annualized savings of $200 million to $250 million. \n\n&#32;52 \n\nAs a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. The savings generated by this program will be reinvested in brand-building initiatives. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn February 2014, the Company announced that we are expanding our productivity and reinvestment program to drive an incremental $1 billion in productivity by 2016 that will primarily be redirected into increased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, expanded savings through global supply chain optimization, data and information technology system standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. These savings will be reinvested in global brand building initiatives, with an emphasis on increased media spending. Second, we will be increasing the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth. \n\nProductivity Initiatives \n\nDuring 2011, the Company successfully completed our four-year global productivity program and exceeded our target of providing $500 million in annualized savings from these initiatives. These savings have provided the Company additional flexibility to invest for growth. The Company generated these savings in a number of areas, including aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a \"procure-to-pay\" program. In realizing these savings, the Company incurred total costs of $ 496 million &#32;related to these productivity initiatives since they commenced during the first quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIntegration of CCE's Former North America Business \n\nIn 2010, we acquired CCE's former North America business and began an integration initiative to develop, design and implement our revised operating framework. In 2011, we completed this program. The Company incurred total pretax expenses of $486 million &#32;related to this initiative since the plan commenced, and we realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIntegration of Our German Bottling and Distribution Operations \n\nThe Company's integration initiatives include costs related to the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company began these integration initiatives in 2008 and has incurred total pretax expenses of $ 627 million &#32;since they commenced. The Company is currently reviewing other restructuring opportunities within the German bottling and distribution operations, which if implemented will result in additional charges in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2013 , the Company had not finalized any additional restructuring plans. The Company does anticipate incurring additional integration costs related to information technology and other initiatives. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#32;53 \n\nOperating Income and Operating Margin \n\nInformation about our operating income contribution by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n10.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n9.8 \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n28.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n27.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n30.4 \n\nLatin America \n\n28.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n26.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n27.7 \n\nNorth America \n\n23.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n24.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n22.8 \n\nPacific \n\n24.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n23.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n22.0 \n\nBottling Investments \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\nCorporate \n\n(16.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(12.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(14.9 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInformation about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n22.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n39.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n40.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n38.7 \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n61.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n66.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n64.7 \n\nLatin America \n\n61.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n63.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n63.9 \n\nNorth America \n\n11.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.3 \n\nPacific \n\n46.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n44.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n40.3 \n\nBottling Investments \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\nCorporate \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * \n\nCalculation is not meaningful. \n\n##TABLE_END Year Ended December 31, 2013, versus Year Ended December 31, 2012 \n\nIn 2013, foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 4 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Australian dollar and Japanese yen, which impacted the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Latin America and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nOperating income for Eurasia and Africa for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1,087 million &#32;and $1,078 million , respectively. In 2013, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 8 percent. The segment&#8217;s operating income was also favorably impacted by volume and revenue growth during 2013, partially offset by continued investments in our brands and increased operating expenses. \n\nOperating income for Europe for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $2,859 million &#32;and $2,960 million , respectively. In 2013, operating income was minimally impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by higher cost of goods sold and higher operating expenses due to the consolidation of the innocent branded juice and smoothie business. Generally, bottling and finished product operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. During 2013, operating income was reduced by $57 million due to charges related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program. \n\n&#32;54 \n\nOperating income for the Latin America segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $2,908 million &#32;and $2,879 million , respectively. In 2013, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 10 percent. Operating income for the segment was also impacted by favorable pricing across all of the business units and volume growth in the Latin Center and South Latin business units, partially offset by continued investments in the brands, including investments related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup TM . \n\nNorth America's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $2,432 million &#32;and $2,597 million , respectively. In both 2013 and 2012, operating income was minimally impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable product and package mix. North America&#8217;s operating income was also reduced by $282 million due to charges related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program, as compared to $227 million of similar charges in 2012. \n\nOperating income in Pacific for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $2,478 million &#32;and $2,516 million , respectively. In 2013, the segment's operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 2 percent, charges of $25 million related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives, as compared to $2 million of similar charges in 2012. \n\nOur Bottling Investments segment's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $115 million &#32;and $140 million , respectively. In 2013, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 8 percent. Operating income was also reduced due to the deconsolidation of our Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, operating income in 2013 was reduced by $194 million due to charges related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives, as compared to $164 million of related charges in 2012. \n\nThe Corporate segment's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1,651 million &#32;and $1,391 million , respectively. Operating loss in 2013 included impairment charges of $195 million recorded on certain of the Company&#8217;s intangible assets. Operating loss also included charges of $120 million related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives, as compared to similar charges of $33 million in 2012. Operating loss in 2013 was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 2 percent. \n\nBased on spot rates as of the beginning of February 2014 and our hedging coverage in place, the Company expects currencies to have a 10 percent unfavorable impact on operating income for the first quarter of 2014 and a 7 percent unfavorable impact on operating income for the full year of 2014. Additionally, in January 2014, in an effort to control inflation, pricing and product shortages, the Venezuelan government imposed a cap on profit margins earned by businesses in Venezuela. We are currently evaluating the impact of this law which, along with further controls on foreign currency exchange, further devaluation or other actions by the Venezuelan government, could have an adverse impact on our 2014 operating income. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2012, versus Year Ended December 31, 2011 \n\nIn 2012, foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 5 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the South African rand, British pound, euro, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which impacted the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on our Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nOur 2012 consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Consequently, the shift in our geographic mix is driving favorable product mix from a global perspective. \n\n&#32;55 \n\nOperating income for Eurasia and Africa for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1,078 million &#32;and $1,003 million , respectively. In 2012, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 percent. The unfavorable impact of the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates was offset by volume and revenue growth across the operating segment. \n\nEurope&#8217;s operating income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $2,960 million &#32;and $3,090 million , respectively. In 2012, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 4 percent. Operating income also declined in 2012 as a result of lower sales volume and shifts in product, package and channel mix across the market due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and weak consumer confidence, partially offset by efficient expense management. \n\nOperating income in Latin America for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $2,879 million &#32;and $2,815 million , respectively. In 2012, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 10 percent. In spite of the unfavorable currency impact, operating income in Latin America increased in 2012, reflecting solid volume growth and favorable pricing across the group, partially offset by continued investments in the business, including some initial investments related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup TM . \n\nNorth America's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $2,597 million &#32;and $2,319 million , respectively. Operating income in 2012 was minimally impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and increased primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. The effects of these favorable impacts on operating income were partially offset by higher commodity costs and ongoing investment in marketplace executional capabilities. Additionally, operating income in 2012 was reduced by $221 million due to charges related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives, as compared to $358 million of restructuring charges related to the integration of CCE's former North America business in 2011. \n\nOperating income in Pacific for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $2,516 million &#32;and $2,239 million , respectively. In 2012, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 2 percent. Operating income also benefited from operating leverage as a result of productivity initiatives, as well as positive geographic mix, partially offset by shifts in product and channel mix. \n\nOur Bottling Investments segment's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $140 million &#32;and $224 million , respectively. Operating income in 2012 was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 19 percent. Operating income in 2012 was also reduced by $164 million due to charges related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives, as compared to $89 million of similar charges in 2011. \n\nThe Corporate segment's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1,391 million &#32;and $1,517 million , respectively. The 2012 loss was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 1 percent. The 2012 operating loss was favorably impacted by charges of $33 million in 2012 related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives, as compared to $122 million of similar charges in 2011. \n\nInterest Income \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 &#32; \n\nInterest income was $ 534 million &#32;in 2013 , compared to $ 471 million &#32;in 2012 , an increase of $63 million, or 13 percent. The increase primarily reflects higher cash balances and an increased return on investments in certain of our international locations as well as additional investments in debt securities and money market funds in connection with the Company's overall cash management strategy. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 &#32; \n\nInterest income was $ 471 million &#32;in 2012 , compared to $ 483 million &#32;in 2011 , a decrease of $12 million, or 2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is held by our international locations. \n\n&#32;56 \n\nInterest Expense \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 \n\nInterest expense was $ 463 million &#32;in 2013 , compared to $ 397 million &#32;in 2012 , an increase of $66 million, or 17 percent. This increase is primarily due to charges of $53 million the Company recorded on the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt, as well as an overall higher average long-term debt balance in 2013. These charges include both the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished as well as hedge accounting adjustments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of interest rate swaps on our fixed-rate debt. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's hedging program. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Cash Flows from Financing Activities &#8212; Debt Financing\" below for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt activity. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 &#32; \n\nInterest expense was $ 397 million &#32;in 2012 , compared to $ 417 million &#32;in 2011 , a decrease of $20 million, or 5 percent. This decrease reflects the impact of long-term debt maturities during the second quarter of 2012 and a net benefit related to interest rate swaps on our fixed-rate debt, partially offset by the impact of additional long-term debt the Company issued during the first quarter of 2012. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our interest rate swaps. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Cash Flows from Financing Activities &#8212; Debt Financing\" below for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt activity. \n\nEquity Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 &#32; \n\nEquity income (loss) &#8212; net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2013 , equity income was $ 602 million , compared to equity income of $ 819 million &#32;in 2012 , a decrease of $217 million, or 27 percent. This decrease reflects, among other items, the unfavorable impact of the challenging economic conditions around the world where many of our equity method investees operate, the impact of unusual or infrequent charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies. Equity income (loss) &#8212; net was also impacted by the deconsolidation of our Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations and the consolidation of innocent. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these transactions. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the unusual or infrequent charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 &#32; \n\nIn 2012 , equity income was $ 819 million , compared to equity income of $ 690 million &#32;in 2011 , an increase of $129 million, or 19 percent. This increase was primarily due to more favorable operating results reported by certain of our equity method investees, a decrease in the impact of unusual or infrequent charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees, and the Company's acquisition of an equity ownership interest in Aujan during 2012, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the unusual or infrequent charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees. \n\n&#32;57 \n\nOther Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nOther income (loss) &#8212; net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses; dividend income; rental income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to business combinations and disposals; realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities; other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities; and the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2013, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $ 576 million , primarily related to a gain of $615 million &#32;due to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations as a result of their combination with an independent bottling partner; a gain of $139 million &#32;as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA, an equity method investee, issuing additional shares of its own stock at per share amounts greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment; and dividend income of $70 million. The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by a charge of $140 million &#32;due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which resulted in the Company remeasuring the net assets related to its operations in Venezuela, and a net charge of $114 million &#32;related to our investment in four bottling partners that merged during 2013 to form CCEJ through a share exchange. Refer to Note 2 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2012, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $ 137 million , primarily related to a gain of $185 million due to the merger of Embotelladora Andina S.A. (\"Andina\") and Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A. (\"Polar\"); a gain of $92 million the Company recognized as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock at per share amounts greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment; dividend income of $44 million; and net gains of $31 million related to fluctuations in the fair value of the Company's trading securities and the sale of available-for-sale securities. The favorable impact of the previous items was partially offset by a charge of $108 million due to the loss we recognized on the then pending sale of a majority ownership interest in our consolidated Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA; a charge of $82 million related to the premium we paid in excess of the publicly traded market price to acquire an ownership interest in Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. (\"Mikuni\"); and charges of $16 million due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of certain cost method investments. Refer to Note 2 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2011, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $ 529 million , primarily related to a net gain of $ 417 million &#32;the Company recognized due to the merger of Arca and Contal; a net gain of $ 122 million &#32;the Company recognized due to Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock at per share amounts greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment, partially offset by charges associated with certain of the Company's equity method investments in Japan; and a gain of $ 102 million &#32;due to the sale of our investment in Coca-Cola Embonor, S.A. (\"Embonor\"). Other income (loss) &#8212; net also included $10 million of realized and unrealized gains on trading securities. The net favorable impact of the previous items was partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses of $73 million; charges of $ 41 million &#32;due to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $17 million due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain of the Company's available-for-sale securities; and $ 5 million &#32;due to the finalization of working capital adjustments associated with the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE during the fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent . As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Swaziland. The terms of these grants expire from 2015 &#32;to 2022 . We expect each of these grants to be renewed indefinitely. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $ 279 million , $ 280 million &#32;and $ 193 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. \n\n&#32;58 \n\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nState and local income taxes &#8212; net of federal benefit \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal rate \n\n(10.3 \n\n) \n\n1,2,3 &#160; \n\n(9.5 \n\n) \n\n6,7 &#160; \n\n(9.5 \n\n) \n\n10,11,12 &#160; \n\nReversal of valuation allowances \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4 \n\n) \n\n8 &#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity income or loss \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n4 &#160; \n\n(2.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n13 &#160; \n\nOther operating charges \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n9 &#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n14 &#160; \n\nOther &#8212; net \n\n(0.7 \n\n) \n\n5 &#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8 \n\n) \n\n15,16,17,18 &#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n24.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n23.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 \n\nIncludes a tax benefit of $26 million &#32;(or a 0.2 percent &#32;impact on our effective tax rate) related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 \n\nIncludes a tax expense of $279 million &#32;on pretax net gains of $501 million &#32;(or a 0.9 percent &#32;impact on our effective tax rate) related to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations upon their combination with an independent bottler and a loss due to the merger of four of the Company's Japanese bottling partners.

If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate of $ 166 million , exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $ 64 million , which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. \n\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefit amounts is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nIncreases related to prior period tax positions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecreases related to prior period tax positions \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n) \n\nIncreases related to current period tax positions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecreases related to current period tax positions \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(45 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nReductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations \n\n(59 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(46 \n\n) \n\nIncreases (decreases) from effects of foreign currency exchange rates \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had $ 105 million , $ 113 million &#32;and $ 110 million &#32;in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. Of these amounts, $ 8 million &#32;of benefit, $ 33 million &#32;of expense and $ 2 million &#32;of benefit were recognized through income tax expense in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate. \n\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2014 is expected to be approximately 23 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate. \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position \n\nWe believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Operating Activities\" below. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2014. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. In addition to the Company's cash balances, commercial paper program, and our ability to issue long-term debt, we also had $ 6,410 million &#32;in lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2013 . These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2014 &#32;through 2018 . \n\n&#32;60 \n\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 81 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2013. We earn a substantial amount of our consolidated operating income and income before income taxes in foreign subsidiaries that either sell concentrate to our local bottling partners or, in certain instances, sell finished products directly to our customers to fulfill the demand for Company beverage products outside the United States. A significant portion of these foreign earnings is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. The Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 . With the exception of an insignificant amount, for which U.S. federal and state income taxes have already been provided, we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Additionally, the absence of a government-approved mechanism to convert local currency into U.S. dollars in Argentina and Venezuela restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends from these locations. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company's subsidiaries in Argentina and Venezuela held $353 million and $324 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities. \n\nNet operating revenues in the United States were $19.8 billion in 2013, or 42 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and the issuance of debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund significant discretionary activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations or is available through the issuance of debt, we could elect to repatriate future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This alternative could result in a higher effective tax rate. While the likelihood is remote, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. This alternative could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. \n\nBased on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. These commitments include, but are not limited to, regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, capital expenditures, share repurchases and obligations included under the heading \"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\" below. \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;was $ 10,542 million , $ 10,645 million &#32;and $ 9,474 million , respectively. \n\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $103 million, or 1 percent, in 2013 &#32;compared to 2012 . This decrease primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, an increase in tax payments and the effect of the deconsolidation of our Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations during 2013, partially offset by lower pension funding in 2013 compared to 2012. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the deconsolidation of these bottling operations. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Net Operating Revenues\" above for additional information on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to Note 13 and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the pension funding and tax payments. \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $1,171 million, or 12 percent, in 2012 &#32;compared to 2011 . This increase reflects higher receipts from customers, lower tax payments and the favorable impact of the Company discontinuing its temporary extension of credit terms in Japan. The favorable impact of the previous items was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations and an increase in contributions to our pension plans. \n\nThe Company discontinued the temporary extension of its credit terms in Japan during the first quarter of 2012. We originally extended our credit terms in Japan during the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the natural disasters that devastated portions of the country on March 11, 2011. This change resulted in an increase in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2012 . \n\n&#32;61 \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of investments \n\n$ \n\n(14,782 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(14,824 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,798 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of investments \n\n12,791 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,791 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,811 \n\nAcquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities \n\n(353 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,486 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(971 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment \n\n(2,550 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,780 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,920 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investing activities \n\n(303 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(268 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(145 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \n\n$ \n\n(4,214 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(11,404 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,524 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $7,190 million in 2013 &#32;compared to 2012 . This decrease was primarily related to a change in the Company's overall cash management program during 2012 which resulted in a greater use of cash in the first year of implementation. The Company's strategy around its cash management program has remained the same in 2013 but has resulted, and will continue to result, in a lower use of cash when compared to the amount used during the first year of implementation. Refer to the heading \"Purchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments,\" below for the impact this change had on our consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments \n\nIn 2013 , purchases of investments were $ 14,782 million , and proceeds from disposals of investments were $ 12,791 million . This activity resulted in a net cash outflow of $1,991 million during 2013 . In 2012 , purchases of investments were $ 14,824 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of investments were $ 7,791 million , resulting in a net cash outflow of $7,033 million. In 2011 , purchases of investments were $ 4,798 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of investments were $ 5,811 million , resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,013 million. These investments include time deposits that have maturities greater than three months but less than one year and are classified in the line item short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company made changes to its overall cash management program in 2012. In an effort to manage counterparty risk and diversify our assets, the Company shifted a large portion of its cash balances to investments in high-quality securities, primarily investments in debt securities, which were classified in the line item marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 &#32;and Note 3 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities \n\nIn 2013 , the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 353 million . These activities primarily included our acquisition of the majority of the remaining outstanding shares of innocent and a majority interest in bottling operations in Myanmar. \n\nIn 2012 , the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 1,486 million . These activities were primarily related to the following: our investments in the existing beverage business of Aujan, one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East; our investment in Mikuni, a bottling partner located in Japan; our acquisition of Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Inc. (\"Sacramento bottler\"); and our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala. None of the Company's other acquisitions or investments was individually significant. \n\nIn 2011 , our Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 971 million . These activities were primarily related to the acquisitions of Great Plains and Honest Tea, Inc. (\"Honest Tea\"), and an additional investment in Coca-Cola Central Japan Company (\"Central Japan\"). In addition, these activities included immaterial cash payments for the finalization of working capital adjustments related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. None of the Company's other acquisitions or investments was individually significant. \n\nRefer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 . \n\n&#32;62 \n\nOn February 5, 2014, the Company entered into agreements with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. (\"GMCR\"), providing for the development and introduction of the Company's global brand portfolio for use in GMCR's forthcoming Keurig Cold TM &#32;at-home beverage system and the acquisition by the Company of an approximate 10 percent equity position in GMCR. Under the terms of the equity agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company agreed to purchase 16,684,139 newly issued shares in GMCR for approximately $1.25 billion. The newly issued shares have been priced at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted-average price as of the agreement date. The transaction closed on February 27, 2014. \n\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities \n\nIn 2013 , proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $ 872 million . These proceeds primarily included the sale of a majority ownership interest in our previously consolidated Philippine bottling operations, and separately, the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn 2011 , proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $ 398 million . These proceeds were primarily related to the sale of our investment in Embonor for $394 million. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment net of disposals for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;were $2,439 million, $2,637 million and $2,819 million, respectively.

None of these investments was individually significant. \n\nIn 2012, other investing activities were primarily related to the Company's consolidated Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations being classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2012. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. The cash flow impact of these transactions in other investing activities represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents held by these entities being transferred to assets held for sale. \n\nIn 2011, other investing activities were primarily related to the Company's investments in joint ventures. None of these investments was individually significant. \n\n&#32;63 \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIssuances of debt \n\n$ \n\n43,425 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n42,791 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,495 \n\nPayments of debt \n\n(38,714 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(38,573 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(22,530 \n\n) \n\nIssuances of stock \n\n1,328 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,489 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,569 \n\nPurchases of stock for treasury \n\n(4,832 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,559 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,513 \n\n) \n\nDividends \n\n(4,969 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,595 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,300 \n\n) \n\nOther financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities \n\n$ \n\n(3,745 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(3,347 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,234 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDebt Financing \n\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, our long-term debt was rated \"AA-\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"Aa3\" by Moody's and \"A+\" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1+\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"P-1\" by Moody's and \"F-1\" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including New CCE, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers. \n\nIn February 2014, Fitch affirmed the Company's A+ long-term debt rating and F-1 commercial paper rating, but revised its rating outlook from stable to negative. The Company does not believe that a downgrade would have a material adverse effect on our cost of borrowing. \n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. \n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. \n\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. On December 31, 2013 , we had $ 6,410 million &#32;in lines of credit available for general corporate purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2014 &#32;through 2018 . There were no borrowings under these backup lines of credit during 2013. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. \n\nIn 2013, the Company had issuances of debt of $43,425 million , which included $35,944 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $7,481 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. \n\n&#32;64 \n\nDuring 2013, the Company made payments of $38,714 million , which included $70 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $35,199 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt payments of $3,445 million. The long-term debt payments included the extinguishment of $2,154 million &#32;of long-term debt prior to maturity, which resulted in associated charges of $53 million, including hedge accounting adjustments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2013. \n\nIn 2012, the Company had issuances of debt of $42,791 million, which included $40,008 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $2,783 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. \n\nDuring 2012, the Company made payments of debt of $38,573 million. Total payments of debt included $1,553 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and $35,118 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total payments of debt also included long-term debt payments of $1,902 million. \n\nIn 2011, the Company had issuances of debt of $27,495 million, which included $25,219 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $2,276 million, net of the debt issued to exchange a certain amount of our existing long-term debt. The Company issued $2,979 million of long-term debt during 2011. We used $979 million of this newly issued debt and paid a premium of $208 million to exchange $1,022 million of existing long-term debt that was assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business in the fourth quarter of 2010. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce the Company's outstanding commercial paper balance and exchange a certain amount of short-term debt. \n\nDuring 2011, the Company made payments of debt of $22,530 million, including repurchased debt that was assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. Total payments of debt included $91 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and $20,334 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total payments of debt also included long-term debt payments of $2,105 million. During 2011, the Company recorded a net charge of $9 million in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income due to the exchange, repurchase and/or extinguishment of long-term debt described above. \n\nThe carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from CCE of $ 514 million &#32;and $ 617 million &#32;as of December 31, 2013 &#32;and 2012 , respectively. These fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years remaining until the underlying debt matures. As of December 31, 2013 , the weighted-average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 19 years. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $ 498 million , $ 574 million &#32;and $ 573 million &#32;in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt balances. \n\nIssuances of Stock \n\nThe issuances of stock in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;were primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. \n\n&#32;65 \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nOn July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to 600 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program took effect on October 31, 2006. Although there were approximately 43 million shares that were yet to be purchased under this share repurchase program, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 500 million shares of the Company's common stock on October 18, 2012 (the \"2012 Plan\"). The 2012 Plan allowed the Company to continue repurchasing shares following the completion of the prior program. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of shares repurchased (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage price per share \n\n$ \n\n39.84 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37.11 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33.73 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSince the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2013 , we have purchased 3.1 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $13.82. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2013, we repurchased $4.8 billion of our stock. The net impact of the Company's treasury stock issuance and purchase activities in 2013 resulted in a net cash outflow of $3.5 billion. We currently expect to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion of our stock during 2014, net of proceeds from the issuance of stock due to the exercise of employee stock options. \n\nDividends \n\nAt its February 2014 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 9 percent, raising it to $0.305 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.22 per share in 2014. This is our 52 nd &#32;consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $ 1.12 &#32;per share, $ 1.02 &#32;per share and $ 0.94 &#32;per share in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. The 2013 &#32;dividend represented a 10 percent increase from 2012 , and the 2012 &#32;dividend represented an 8.5 percent increase from 2011 . \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation under certain guarantee contracts; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation under certain derivative instruments; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. \n\n##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2013 , we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $ 662 million , of which $ 288 million &#32;was related to VIEs. These guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2013 , we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. \n\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , the Company had $ 6,410 million &#32;in lines of credit for general corporate purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2014 &#32;through 2018 . There were no borrowings under these backup lines of credit during 2013. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which are presently significant to our Company. \n\n&#32;66 \n\nAggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , the Company's contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2015-2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017-2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n2019 and \n\nThereafter \n\nShort-term loans and notes payable: 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommercial paper borrowings \n\n$ \n\n16,853 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,853 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nLines of credit and other short-term borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt 2 \n\n1,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities 2 \n\n18,722 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,225 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,685 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,812 \n\nEstimated interest payments 3 \n\n5,084 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,060 \n\nAccrued income taxes 4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations 5 \n\n16,427 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,398 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,502 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,866 \n\nMarketing obligations 6 \n\n5,035 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,467 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,121 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase of minority shares 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLease obligations \n\n1,258 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n$ \n\n65,258 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n32,333 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,097 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,964 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,864 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 &#160; \n\nWe calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2013 rate for all years presented. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2013 , the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was $327 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5 &#160; \n\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6 &#160; \n\nWe expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 7 &#160; \n\nAmount represents the Company's obligation to pay the minority shareowners of our German bottling and distribution operations to purchase their shares in January 2014 under existing put options. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2013 , was $1,869 million. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. \n\nWe generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $5,895 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $6,343 million. The projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $2,950 million, and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was $2,403 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law \n\n&#32;67 \n\nrestrictions, as well as certain unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately $70 million in 2014 and remain near that level through 2027, decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2014, we expect to contribute an additional $175 million to our international pension plans. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. \n\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2013 , our self-insurance reserves totaled $ 537 million . Refer to Note 11 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above. \n\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2013 , were $6,491 million . Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. \n\nOn February 5, 2014, the Company entered into agreements with GMCR providing for the development and introduction of the Company's global brand portfolio for use in GMCR's forthcoming Keurig Cold TM &#32;at-home beverage system and the acquisition by the Company of an approximate 10 percent equity position in GMCR. Under the terms of the equity agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company agreed to purchase 16,684,139 newly issued shares in GMCR for approximately $1.25 billion. The newly issued shares have been priced at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted-average price as of the agreement date. The transaction closed on February 27, 2014. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. \n\nIn 2013 , we used 81 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAll operating currencies \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nBrazilian real \n\n(9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMexican peso \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nAustralian dollar \n\n(6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nSouth African rand \n\n(13 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(12 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nBritish pound \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nEuro \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nJapanese yen \n\n(18 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThese percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of approximately 4 percent and 5 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Based on spot rates as of the beginning of February 2014 and our hedging \n\n&#32;68 \n\ncoverage in place, the Company expects currencies to have a 10 percent negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of 2014 and a 7 percent negative impact on operating income for the full year of 2014. \n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" above. The Company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $162 million, $2 million and $73 million in 2013 , 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. \n\nHyperinflationary Economies \n\nOur Company conducts business in more than 200 countries, some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years. These economies create financial exposure for the Company. \n\nA hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 100 percent &#32;or more over a three-year period. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. \n\nDuring February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency to an official rate of exchange (\"official rate\") of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The Company remeasured the net assets of our local subsidiary and recognized a related loss of $140 million from remeasurement in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nThe Company will continue to use the official rate to remeasure the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. In December 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the currency for foreign tourists to 11.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. While this rate is not applicable to the Company, it may indicate that another official currency devaluation that would impact companies doing business in the country could occur. If the official rate devalues further, or if we are able to access currency at different rates that are reasonable to the Company, it would result in our Company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange gains or losses in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2013, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of $ 426 million &#32;and monetary liabilities of $ 45 million . \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. If a government-approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela is not available, the amount of receivables related to these sales will continue to increase. The carrying value of these receivables was $267 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we have certain U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. If the bolivar further devalues, it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets. As of December 31, 2013, intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela had a carrying value of $107 million. \n\nThe Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. \n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices \n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. \n\n&#32;69 \n\nOverview of Financial Position \n\nThe following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Company's consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent Change \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n10,414 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,442 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,972 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nShort-term investments \n\n6,707 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,017 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,690 \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketable securities \n\n3,147 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,092 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTrade accounts receivable &#8212; net \n\n4,873 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,759 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInventories \n\n3,277 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,264 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nPrepaid expenses and other assets \n\n2,886 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,781 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets held for sale \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,973 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,973 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(100 \n\n) \n\nEquity method investments \n\n10,393 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,177 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investments, principally bottling companies \n\n1,119 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,232 \n\n&#160; \n\n(113 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\nOther assets \n\n4,661 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,585 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,076 \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, plant and equipment &#8212; net \n\n14,967 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTrademarks with indefinite lives \n\n6,744 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives \n\n7,415 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nGoodwill \n\n12,312 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,255 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther intangible assets \n\n1,140 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,150 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\nTotal assets \n\n$ \n\n90,055 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n86,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,881 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses \n\n$ \n\n9,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,680 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nLoans and notes payable \n\n16,901 \n\n&#160; \n\n16,297 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt \n\n1,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n(553 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(35 \n\n) \n\nAccrued income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(162 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(34 \n\n) \n\nLiabilities held for sale \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(796 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(100 \n\n) \n\nLong-term debt \n\n19,154 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,736 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,418 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther liabilities \n\n3,498 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,468 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,970 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\nDeferred income taxes \n\n6,152 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,981 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,171 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal liabilities \n\n$ \n\n56,615 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n53,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nNet assets \n\n$ \n\n33,440 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1 &#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes a decrease in net assets of $1,190 million resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. \n\n##TABLE_END The table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities increased $3,717 million, or 22 percent, as a combined group. This increase reflects the Company's overall cash management strategy. A majority of the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities are held by foreign subsidiaries. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAssets held for sale decreased $2,973 million , or 100 percent, and liabilities held for sale decreased $796 million , or &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;100 percent , due to the Company completing the deconsolidation of its Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations in January 2013 and July 2013, respectively. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nEquity method investments increased $ 1,177 million , or 13 percent , primarily due to the sale of a majority ownership interest in our previously consolidated Philippine bottling operations in January 2013 and the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013, partially offset by the consolidation of innocent which had previously been accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company now accounts for our ownership interests in the \n\n##TABLE_END &#32;70 \n\nPhilippine and Brazilian bottling operations under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther assets increased $1,076 million , or 30 percent , and other liabilities decreased $1,970 million , or 36 percent , primarily due to the reclassification of certain pension plans' net asset balances out of other liabilities as a result of actuarial gains, higher returns and incremental funding during 2013. In addition, the other assets balance increased as a result of higher investment balances in our captive insurance companies. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses increased $897 million , or 10 percent , primarily due to the Company receiving notification that put options it had issued in 2007 to minority shareholders of our German bottling and distribution operations to sell their respective shares would be exercised in January 2014. As a result, the related liability was reclassified out of the line item other liabilities into the line item accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the bottling transaction. In addition, accounts payable and accrued expenses increased due to the timing of marketing and restructuring accruals. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLong-term debt increased $ 4,418 million , or 30 percent , primarily due to the Company's issuance of long-term debt net of early retirements during 2013. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" above and Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our long-term debt balance. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeferred income taxes increased $1,171 million , or 24 percent , primarily due to the impact related to the net changes in the Company's U.S. pension plan assumptions as well as a deferred tax liability recorded as a result of the Company's equity investment in the newly combined Brazilian bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Brazilian bottling transaction and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's deferred income taxes. \n\n##TABLE_END ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 429, "Negative": 440, "Polarity": -0.012658227833534836, "Subjectivity": 0.05963900898636751}, "similarity_score": 0.9935585837192408, "nlp_result": 0}
