The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. \n\nOverview \n\nVisa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. \n\nU.S. Tax Reform Legislation. &#32;On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Tax Act&#8221;). The Tax Act transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date and the remeasurement resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion and was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018 . In transitioning to the new territorial system, the Tax Act requires us to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income. This tax, referred to as the &#8220;transition tax&#8221;, was estimated to be $1.1 billion and was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018 . See Note 16&#8212;Income Taxes &#32; to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . \n\nFinancial overview. Our financial results for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 &#32;include the impact of several significant one-time items. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nNet income, as reported \n\n$ \n\n10,301 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,699 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,991 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nDiluted earnings per share, as reported \n\n$ \n\n4.42 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.80 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.48 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income, as adjusted (2) \n\n$ \n\n10,729 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,335 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,862 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nDiluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) \n\n$ \n\n4.61 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.48 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.84 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results &#32;below. \n\n##TABLE_END Highlights for fiscal 2018 . Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2018 &#32;reflects solid global consumer spending growth, supported by favorable U.S. economic conditions and tempered by volatility in some emerging markets. We recorded net operating revenues of $20.6 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , an increase of 12% &#32;over the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume and nominal cross-border volume. The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive &#32;impact to our net operating revenue growth. \n\nTotal operating expenses for fiscal 2018 &#32;were $7.7 billion , compared to $6.2 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 . The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by a higher litigation provision and continued investments to support our business growth. \n\n&#32;33 \n\nAdjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 &#32;reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCharitable contributions \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nDuring fiscal 2018, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million , before tax, and recorded $193 million &#32;of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million , determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nDuring fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million , before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million , determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLitigation provision. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $600 million &#32;and related tax benefits of $137 million &#32;associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRemeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act&#8217;s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nTransition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act&#8217;s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nElimination of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSeverance cost. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRemeasurement of deferred tax liability. &#32;During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAcquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nVisa Europe Framework Agreement &#32; loss . During fiscal 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe transaction, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32;34 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNet gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nForeign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a decrease of $255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income in other non-operating income.

During fiscal 2018, we recorded an additional accrual of $600 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to U.S. covered litigation of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2018. We also deposited $600 million &#32;of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32; and Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . \n\nReduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2018 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 63 million &#32;shares at an average price of $124.29 &#32;per share. Of the 63 million &#32;shares, 58 million &#32;were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion &#32;of operating cash on hand. Additionally, in June 2018, we deposited $600 million &#32;of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Also, we recovered $56 million &#32;of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2018 . The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because they reduce the class B common stock conversion rate and the UK&#38;I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduce the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32;and Note 11&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . \n\nIn January 2018 , our board of directors authorized an additional $7.5 billion &#32;share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2018 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion &#32;for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 &#32;have been completed. See Note 11&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . \n\n&#32;36 \n\nNominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted low double-digit growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit and debit. Nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate was 11% &#32;for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018. Growth on a constant-dollar basis was not significantly different from the nominal-dollar basis growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 (1) . Growth in processed transactions for fiscal 2017 reflects the inclusion of Visa Europe&#8217;s processed transactions for the full year compared to three months in fiscal 2016. \n\nThe following tables (2) &#32;present nominal payments and cash volume: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (7) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVisa Inc.

Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) &#160; \n\nAs a result of European Union Interchange Fee regulation changes, effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Europe co-badged payments volume is no longer included in reported volume.

Our operating revenues and related processed transactions for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the financial results or related processed transactions of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nVisa processed transactions in fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinancial Information Presentation \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nOur operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. \n\nThe following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: \n\nService revenues &#32;consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter&#8217;s payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. \n\nData processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. \n\nInternational transaction revenues &#32;are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. \n\nOther revenues &#32;consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. With respect to fiscal 2016, other revenues also consists of revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. &#32; \n\n&#32;38 \n\nClient incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nPersonnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. \n\nMarketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. \n\nNetwork and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. \n\nProfessional fees &#32;mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses &#32;mainly consist of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business, and with respect to fiscal 2016, transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition. \n\nLitigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management&#8217;s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management&#8217;s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. \n\nVisa Europe Framework Agreement &#32; loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. \n\nNon-operating Income (Expense) \n\nNon-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations, and with respect to fiscal 2016, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income. \n\n&#32;39 \n\nResults of Operations \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nThe following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016. Visa Europe revenue earned for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is included in International. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nUnited States \n\n$ \n\n9,332 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,704 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,851 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nInternational \n\n11,277 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,654 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,040 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,623 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nRevenues earned under the Framework Agreement (3) \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(191 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n&#160; \n\n(100 \n\n)% \n\nNet operating revenues \n\n$ \n\n20,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,358 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,082 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,251 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,276 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. \n\n##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume, and processed transactions. The increase in operating revenues in fiscal 2017 also reflects the inclusion of operating revenues from Visa Europe for the full year compared to one quarter in fiscal 2016. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives in both fiscal 2018 and 2017. \n\nOur operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2018 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive &#32;impact to our net operating revenue growth. \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Other revenues in fiscal 2016 included revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nService revenues \n\n$ \n\n8,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,975 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,747 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,228 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nData processing revenues \n\n9,027 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,786 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,272 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,241 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,514 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nInternational transaction revenues \n\n7,211 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,321 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,649 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,672 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOther revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nClient incentives \n\n(5,491 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,565 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,409 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(926 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,156 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nNet operating revenues \n\n$ \n\n20,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,358 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,082 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,251 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,276 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 primarily due to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe effects of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$161 million of tax benefits due to various non-recurring audit settlements in fiscal 2018; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe absence of the following items related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\na $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\na $71 million one-time tax benefit related to the Visa Foundation&#8217;s receipt of Visa Inc. shares, previously recorded by Visa Europe as treasury stock. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32;42 \n\nThe effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe items listed above related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe absence of: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nthe effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nan $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nthe non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% &#32;to 21% . The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% &#32;became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate rate is a blended rate of 24.5% , which will be reduced to 21% &#32;in fiscal 2019 and thereafter. \n\nAs a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we provisionally remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date of the Tax Act. The deferred tax remeasurement is now complete and resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion, recorded in fiscal 2018. \n\nIn transitioning to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act requires that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income. Such foreign earnings are subject to a one-time tax at 15.5% &#32;on the amount held in cash or cash equivalents, and at 8% &#32;on the remaining non-cash amount. The 15.5% &#32;and 8% &#32;tax, collectively referred to as the &#8220;transition tax&#8221;, was estimated to be $1.1 billion , and was recorded in fiscal 2018. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. \n\nThe above-mentioned accounting impact of the transition tax is provisional, based on currently available information and technical guidance on the interpretations of the new law. We continue to obtain and analyze additional information and guidance as they become available to complete the accounting for the tax impact of the Tax Act. Additional information currently unavailable that is needed to complete the analysis includes, but is not limited to, foreign tax returns and foreign tax documentation for the computation of foreign tax credits, and the final determination of the untaxed foreign earnings subject to the transition tax. The provisional accounting impact may change until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as permitted by ASU 2018-05. \n\nAdjusted effective income tax rate . Our financial results for fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rates in the tables below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2018 and 2017. See Overview&#8212;Adjusted financial results &#32;within this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. \n\n&#32;43 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear ended September 30, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n12,806 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,505 \n\n&#160; \n\n19.6 \n\n% \n\nCharitable contribution \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLitigation provision \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRemeasurement of deferred tax balances \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,133 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTransition tax on foreign earnings \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,147 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs adjusted \n\n$ \n\n13,408 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,679 \n\n&#160; \n\n20.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear ended September 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n11,694 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,995 \n\n&#160; \n\n42.7 \n\n% \n\nCharitable contribution \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nElimination of deferred tax balances \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,515 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs adjusted \n\n$ \n\n11,886 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,551 \n\n&#160; \n\n29.9 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. \n\nThe objectives of our treasury policies are to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprovide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nensure payments on required litigation settlements; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nmake planned capital investments in our business; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\npay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ninvest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. \n\n&#32;44 \n\nCash Flow Data \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended September 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nTotal cash provided by (used in): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n$ \n\n12,713 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,208 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,574 \n\nInvesting activities \n\n(3,084 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,916 \n\n) \n\nFinancing activities \n\n(11,240 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,924 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n7,477 \n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents \n\n(101 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(34 \n\n) \n\n(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n(1,712 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,255 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,101 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating activiti es. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our underlying business. Fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of Visa Europe in our results for the full year, while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included Visa Europe. Other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nnet deposits made into the U.S. litigation escrow account of $450 million in fiscal 2018; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition during fiscal 2016 related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\npayments of $545 million , $489 million &#32;and $244 million &#32;of interest on the outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32;and Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nInvesting activities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 was higher than the prior-year comparable period as purchases of available-for-sale investment securities reflected additional investment of net proceeds received from new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 reflected net proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction in fiscal 2016. \n\nFinancing activities. &#32;Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the $7.2 billion &#32;used to repurchase class A common stock, $1.9 billion &#32;of dividend payments, the redemption of $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes and $600 million deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, partially offset by payments of $150 million from our litigation escrow account. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $6.9 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.6 billion of dividend payments, partially offset by $2.5 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in September 2017. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected $15.9 billion &#32;net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, partially offset by $7.0 billion &#32;used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.4 billion &#32;of dividend payments. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans , Note 6&#8212;Debt , Note 11&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity &#32;and Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nSources of Liquidity \n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. \n\n&#32;45 \n\nForeign Earnings. &#32;Pursuant to the Tax Act, we are required to pay U.S. tax on most of the undistributed and untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2017. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. As a result of the Tax Act, we are no longer subject to incremental U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in the event that we repatriate these earnings back to the United States. \n\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.4 billion , are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. \n\nFactors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. \n\nCommercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion &#32;in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 &#32;days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2018 . See Note 6&#8212;Debt &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nCredit facility. We have an unsecured $4.0 billion &#32;revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) which expires on January 27, 2022 . There were no borrowings under the credit facility as of September 30, 2018 &#32;and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended September 30, 2018 . See Note 6&#8212;Debt &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nUniversal shelf registration statement. In July 2018, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2021. \n\nU.S. Litigation escrow account. &#32;Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. In June 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32;and Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2018 , was $1.5 billion &#32;and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. \n\nLong-term debt . In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion , with maturities ranging between 5 &#32;and 30 &#32;years. In October 2017, we redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes. The redemption was funded with the net proceeds from the new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance. See Note 6&#8212;Debt &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\n&#32;46 \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nAt September 30, 2018 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nStandard and Poor&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s \n\nDebt type \n\nRating \n\n&#160; \n\nOutlook \n\n&#160; \n\nRating \n\n&#160; \n\nOutlook \n\nShort-term unsecured debt \n\nA-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nPositive \n\n&#160; \n\nP-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\nLong-term unsecured debt \n\nA+ \n\n&#160; \n\nPositive \n\n&#160; \n\nA1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. \n\nUses of Liquidity \n\nPayments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2018 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $931 million. We hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2018 , in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle. \n\nU.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2018 , we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, and made $150 million covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2018 , the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion . In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into a new settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement. The proposed settlement amount is approximately $6.2 billion. Our share represents approximately $4.1 billion, the majority of which will be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court plus the $600 million we deposited into its litigation escrow account in June 2018. No additional funds are required for this class settlement. Our share is covered under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases. Until the court approves the 2018 Settlement Agreement, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the damages class plaintiffs&#8217; claims as contemplated by that agreement. If the 2018 Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation escrow account into court-supervised settlement funds, we will have the right to the majority of these funds, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32; and &#32; Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nOther litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs. \n\nReduction in as-converted shares. &#32;During fiscal 2018 , share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced as-converted class A common stock by 63 million at an average price of $124.38 per share. Of the 63 million shares, 58 million &#32;were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion &#32;of cash on hand. Additionally, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our Class A common stock because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32;and Note 11&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\n&#32;47 \n\nIn January 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $7.5 billion . This authorization has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2018 , we had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. See Note 11&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nDividends . During fiscal 2018 , we declared and paid $1.9 billion &#32;in dividends. On October 16, 2018 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.25 &#32;per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $574 million &#32;in connection with this dividend on December 4, 2018 . See Note 11&#8212;Stockholders&#8217; Equity &#32; to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. \n\nPension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe&#8217;s defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million , $12 million and $4 million, respectively. For Visa Europe&#8217;s UK pension plans, we made contributions of $11 million , $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2019 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe&#8217;s UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million &#32;and $10 million , respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 7&#8212;Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nCapital expenditures. &#32;Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018 , due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. \n\nAcquisitions. In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received. The acquisition will help Visa&#8217;s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional &#8364;1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 5&#8212;Intangible Assets and Goodwill &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nFair Value Measurements&#8212;Financial Instruments \n\nThe assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2018 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $15.0 billion &#32;of assets and $22 million &#32;of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 3&#8212;Fair Value Measurements and Investments &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below. \n\n&#32;48 \n\nIndemnifications \n\nWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See &#32; Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32; and &#32; Note 8&#8212;Settlement Guarantee Management &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2018. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than \n\n1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1-3 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\n3-5 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than \n\n5 Years \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nLong-term debt (1) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,041 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,140 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,719 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,437 \n\nPurchase obligations (2) \n\n1,375 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,525 \n\nLeases (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTransition tax (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,105 \n\nDividends (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred purchase consideration (6) \n\n1,317 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,317 \n\nTotal (7),(8),(9) \n\n$ \n\n4,071 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,853 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,679 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,102 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,705 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nAmounts presented include payments for both interest and principal.

For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nIncludes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nAmounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 16&#8212;Income Taxes &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) &#160; \n\nIncludes expected dividend amount of $574 million &#32;as dividends were declared on October 16, 2018 &#32;and will be paid on December 4, 2018 &#32;to all holders of record of Visa&#8217;s common stock as of November 16, 2018 . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) &#160; \n\nOn June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional &#8364;1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2018 exchange rate. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) &#160; \n\nWe have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, we had also accrued $99 million &#32;of interest and $34 million &#32;of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8) &#160; \n\nWe evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 7&#8212;Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits &#32; to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (9) &#160; \n\nFuture cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to eleven years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2018, we have $2.8 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32;49 \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. \n\nWe believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. \n\nRevenue Recognition &#8212; Client Incentives \n\nCritical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management&#8217;s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management&#8217;s estimate of each client&#8217;s performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2018 , client incentives represented 21% &#32;of gross operating revenues. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Matters \n\nCritical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. \n\nOur U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan&#8217;s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account \n\n&#32;50 \n\nbalance. We recorded an additional accrual of $600 million &#32;for U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2018. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 2&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans &#32;and Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 17&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8&#8212;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this report. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nCritical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 127, "Negative": 214, "Polarity": -0.2551319640611966, "Subjectivity": 0.055528415558454905}, "similarity_score": 0.9908213139913353, "nlp_result": 0}
