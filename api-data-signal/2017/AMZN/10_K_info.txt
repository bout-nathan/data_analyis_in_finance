All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management&#8217;s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management&#8217;s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nOverview \n\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our consumer-facing websites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards. \n\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . &#32;Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 &#32;and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. \n\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. &#32;Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and physical stores. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. \n\n_______________________ \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nSee &#8220;Results of Operations&#8212;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nWorking capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . &#32;On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. \n\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. &#32;We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people&#8217;s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. \n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders&#8217; interests. &#32;We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 497 million &#32;and 504 million &#32;as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. \n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. \n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. \n\nFor additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies.&#8221; \n\n&#160; \n\n_______________________ \n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nThe operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCritical Accounting Judgments \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company&#8217;s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies.&#8221; Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $180 million. \n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. \n\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. \n\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPAs&#8221;) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer \n\npricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission&#8217;s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately &#8364;250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission&#8217;s guidance. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 1&#8212;Description of Business and Accounting Policies.&#8221; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 1 &#8212; Description of Business and Accounting Policies &#8212; Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted,&#8221; is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by (used in): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n$ \n\n12,039 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,272 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,434 \n\nInvesting activities \n\n(6,450 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9,876 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(27,819 \n\n) \n\nFinancing activities \n\n(3,882 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,740 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n9,860 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $ 19.8 billion , $26.0 billion , and $31.0 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $7.3 billion , $9.1 billion , and $11.1 billion , as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. \n\nCash provided by (used in) &#32;operating activities was $12.0 billion , $17.3 billion , and $18.4 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase &#32;in operating cash flow in 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The increase &#32;in operating cash flow in 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) &#32;operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. \n\nCash provided by (used in) &#32;investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) &#32;investing activities was $(6.5) billion , $(9.9) billion , and $(27.8) billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $ 4.6 billion , $ 6.7 billion , and $10.1 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $528 million , $417 million , and $311 million &#32;for internal-use software and website development in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $795 million , $116 million , and $14.0 billion . \n\nCash provided by (used in) &#32;financing activities was $(3.9) billion , $(3.7) billion , and $9.9 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $4.2 billion , $4.4 billion , and $6.4 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.7 billion , $5.7 billion , and $9.6 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , with the increase &#32;reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $353 million , $621 million , and $16.2 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August 2017 (the &#8220;August 2017 Notes&#8221;) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay the 1.200% Notes due November 2017, and for general corporate purposes. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Long-Term Debt&#8221; for additional discussion of the notes. \n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) and $592 million &#32;of borrowings outstanding under our $600 million &#32;secured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) as of December 31, 2017 . See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Long-Term Debt&#8221; for additional information. \n\nIn 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we recorded net tax provisions of $950 million , $1.4 billion , and $769 million . The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts. As of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $9.6 billion. \n\nWe have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act extended through 2026 and enhanced the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $273 million , $412 million , and $957 million &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . As of December 31, 2017 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $226 million &#32;and we had approximately $855 million &#32;of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with its October 2017 decision against us on state aid, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately &#8364;250 million, plus interest. The actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the European Commission. \n\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, workers&#8217; compensation obligations, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents&#8221; to restricted cash, which is classified within &#8220;Accounts receivable, net and other&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2017 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $600 million &#32;and $1.3 billion . See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data \n\n&#8212;Note 7&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $13.0 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2017 . These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. \n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. \n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market from the date of acquisition. In Q1 2017, we combined stock-based compensation and &#8220;Other operating expense, net&#8221; with operating expenses in our presentation of segment results. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 11&#8212;Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(5.2) billion , $(550) million , and $210 million &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see &#8220;Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates&#8221; below. \n\nNorth America sales increased &#32; 25% &#32;and 33% &#32;in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and, in 2017, the impact of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. \n\nInternational sales increased &#32; 24% &#32;and 23% &#32;in 2016 , and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(5.0) billion , $(489) million , and $138 million &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . \n\nAWS sales increased &#32; 55 % and 43 % in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. \n\nOperating Income (Loss) \n\nOperating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income (Loss): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n$ \n\n1,425 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,361 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,837 \n\nInternational \n\n(699 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,283 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,062 \n\n) \n\nAWS \n\n1,507 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,331 \n\nConsolidated \n\n$ \n\n2,233 \n\n$ \n\n4,186 \n\n$ \n\n4,106 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating income was $2.2 billion , $4.2 billion , and $4.1 billion &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. \n\nThe increase &#32;in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $30 million , $27 million , and $(4) million &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . \n\nThe increase &#32;in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $(278) million , $89 million , and $(85) million &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . \n\nThe increase &#32;in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and sales and marketing expenses and related payroll, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $264 million , $(5) million , and $(53) million &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n$ \n\n71,651 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n88,265 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n111,934 \n\nFulfillment \n\n13,410 \n\n&#160; \n\n17,619 \n\n&#160; \n\n25,249 \n\nMarketing \n\n5,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,069 \n\nTechnology and content \n\n12,540 \n\n&#160; \n\n16,085 \n\n&#160; \n\n22,620 \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n1,747 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,432 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,674 \n\nOther operating expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal operating expenses \n\n$ \n\n104,773 \n\n$ \n\n131,801 \n\n$ \n\n173,760 \n\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nFulfillment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTechnology and content \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther operating expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent of Net Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n67.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.9 \n\n% \n\nFulfillment \n\n12.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n13.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.2 \n\nMarketing \n\n4.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.7 \n\nTechnology and content \n\n11.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.7 \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\nOther operating expense, net \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCost of Sales \n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery center and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. \n\nThe increase &#32;in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. \n\nShipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery center and transportation costs, were $11.5 billion , $16.2 billion , and $21.7 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. \n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as &#8220;Technology and content&#8221; as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. \n\nFulfillment \n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as &#8220;Technology and content.&#8221; Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. \n\nThe increase &#32;in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores. \n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. \n\nMarketing \n\nWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, Associates program, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. \n\nThe increase &#32;in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels. \n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. \n\nTechnology and Content \n\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS, as well as these and other efforts. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. \n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure. \n\nFor 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we capitalized $642 million &#32;(including $114 million &#32;of stock-based compensation), $511 million &#32;(including $94 million &#32;of stock-based compensation), and $395 million &#32;(including $84 million &#32;of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million , $634 million , and $545 million &#32;for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\nThe increase &#32;in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2016 &#32;and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. \n\nOther Operating Expense, Net \n\nOther operating expense, net was $171 million , $167 million , and $214 million &#32;during 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. \n\nInterest Income and Expense \n\nOur interest income was $50 million , $100 million , and $202 million &#32;during 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. \n\nInterest expense was $459 million , $484 million , and $848 million &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The increase &#32;is primarily due to increases in our capital and finance lease arrangements and long-term debt. \n\nOur long-term debt was $7.7 billion &#32;and $24.7 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2017 . Our other long-term liabilities were $12.6 billion &#32;and $21.0 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2017 . See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 5&#8212;Long-Term Debt and Note 6&#8212;Other Long-Term Liabilities&#8221; for additional information. \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\nOther income (expense), net was $(256) million , $90 million , and $346 million &#32;during 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. \n\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act on our tax accruals. However, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax is not material. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. \n\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $950 million , $1.4 billion , and $769 million &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. \n\nOur provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the provisional favorable effect of the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. \n\nWe regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we \n\nrecognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. \n\nWe have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. As of December 31, 2017 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $226 million &#32;and we had approximately $855 million &#32;of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. \n\nSee Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 10&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; for additional information. \n\nEquity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax \n\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(22) million , $(96) million , and $(4) million &#32;in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The primary components of this activity during 2015, 2016, and 2017 were our equity-method investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million in 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by &#8220;Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,&#8221; which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, &#8220;Net cash provided by (used in) &#32;operating activities,&#8221; for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 &#32;(in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities \n\n$ \n\n12,039 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,272 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,434 \n\nPurchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives \n\n(4,589 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,737 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,058 \n\n) \n\nFree cash flow \n\n$ \n\n7,450 \n\n$ \n\n10,535 \n\n$ \n\n8,376 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \n\n$ \n\n(6,450 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9,876 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(27,819 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities \n\n$ \n\n(3,882 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(3,740 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,860 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFree Cash Flow Less Lease Principal Repayments \n\nFree cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by &#8220;Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,&#8221; and &#8220;Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,&#8221; which are included in cash flow from financing activities.

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates \n\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods.
