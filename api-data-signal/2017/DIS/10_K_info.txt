The EPS increase in fiscal 2018 &#32;was due to a benefit from new federal income tax legislation, the &#8220;Tax Cuts and Jobs \n\nAct&#8221; (Tax Act) (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), higher segment operating income, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and gains on the sale of real estate and property rights. These increases were partially offset by the comparison to a non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech in the prior year, impairments of our Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments in the current year and higher net interest and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. The increase in segment operating income was due to growth at our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments, partially offset by lower results at our Media Networks and Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segments. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (FX Impact). \n\nRevenues \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2018 &#32; increased &#32; 9% , or $4.0 billion , to $50.9 billion , due to higher theatrical distribution revenue, growth in guest spending and volumes at our parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, increased TV/SVOD distribution revenue and the consolidation of BAMTech. On September 25, 2017, the Company increased its ownership in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. \n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2018 &#32; increased &#32; 3% , or $0.3 billion , to $8.6 billion , due to guest spending and volume growth at our parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in retail store sales. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to a favorable FX Impact. \n\nCosts and expenses \n\nCost of services for fiscal 2018 &#32; increased &#32; 9% , or $2.2 billion , to $27.5 billion , due to higher film and television cost amortization driven by an increase in theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution revenue and contractual rate increases for television programming. Costs of services also increased due to the consolidation of BAMTech and higher costs at our parks and resorts reflecting cost inflation, higher technology and operations support expenses and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. \n\nCost of products for fiscal 2018 &#32; increased &#32; 4% , or $0.2 billion , to $5.2 billion , due to cost inflation and higher guest spending and volumes at our parks and resorts. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2018 increased &#32; 8% , or $0.7 billion , to $8.9 billion , due to higher marketing spend, the consolidation of BAMTech, costs incurred in connection with the 21CF acquisition and an increase in compensation costs. \n\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased &#32; 8% , or $0.2 billion , to $3.0 billion &#32;due to depreciation of new attractions at our parks and resorts segment and the consolidation of BAMTech. Depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $33 million &#32;and $98 million &#32;of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2018 &#32;were due to severance costs. Charges in fiscal 2017 &#32;were due to severance costs and asset impairments. \n\nOther Income, net \n\nOther income, net is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nGains on sales of real estate and property rights \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\n&#160; \n\nSettlement of litigation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(177 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\n&#160; \n\nGain related to the acquisition of BAMTech \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(99 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income, net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;100 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company recorded gains of $560 million in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights in New York City. \n\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company recorded $38 million in insurance recoveries in connection with the settlement of a litigation matter for which the Company recorded a charge of $177 million , net of committed insurance recoveries in fiscal 2017. \n\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a $3 million adjustment to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain of $255 million &#32;recorded in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nInterest Expense, net \n\nInterest expense, net is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(682 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(507 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(35 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and investment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(574 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(385 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(49 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average interest rates, higher average debt balances and financing costs related to the pending 21CF acquisition. \n\nThe decrease in interest and investment income for the year was due to the comparison to gains on investments recognized in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher average interest rates. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nEquity in the income of investees decreased &#32; $422 million , to a loss of $102 million &#32;due to higher losses from Hulu, impairments of Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments and lower income from A+E. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in the prior year. The decrease at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. The decrease at A+E was due to lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nEffective income tax rate \n\n11.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n32.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n20.8 \n\nppt \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Act, which included: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA net benefit of $1.7 billion, which reflected a $2.1 billion benefit from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to the new statutory rate (Deferred Remeasurement), partially offset by a charge of $0.4 billion for a one-time tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings (Deemed Repatriation Tax). This benefit had an impact of approximately 11.5 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA reduction in the Company&#8217;s fiscal 2018 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 24.5% from 35.0% in the prior year. Net of state tax and other related effects, the reduction in the statutory rate had an impact of approximately 8.2 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. \n\n##TABLE_END Noncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased &#32; $82 million &#32;to $468 million &#32;due to lower tax expense at ESPN, largely due to the Tax Act, and the impact of the Company&#8217;s acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Disneyland Paris in the third quarter of the prior year. These increases were partially offset by losses at BAMTech. \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable. \n\n2017 vs. 2016 &#32; \n\nRevenues for fiscal 2017 &#32;decreased 1% , or $0.5 billion, to $55.1 billion ; net income attributable to Disney decreased 4% , or $0.4 billion, to $9.0 billion ; and EPS for the year decreased 1% , or $0.04 to $5.69 . The EPS decrease in fiscal 2017 was due to lower segment operating income at Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media and higher net interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, higher operating income at Parks and Resorts and a decrease in the effective tax rate. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nRevenues \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 1% , or $0.3 billion, to $46.8 billion , due to declines from theatrical and home entertainment distribution, advertising and merchandise licensing. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit from a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened in June 2016, an increase in affiliate fees and higher average guest spending and attendance at our other parks and resorts. Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 2%, or $0.2 billion, to $8.3 billion, due to lower volumes at our home entertainment distribution and retail businesses and the discontinuation of Infinity, partially offset by the impact of a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and higher average guest spending and volumes at our other parks and resorts. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nCosts and expenses \n\nCost of services for fiscal 2017 increased 3% , or $0.7 billion, to $25.3 billion , due to higher sports programming costs, a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and new guest offerings and inflation at our other parks and resorts. These increases were partially offset by lower film cost amortization and theatrical distribution costs. \n\nCost of products for fiscal 2017 decreased 7% , or $0.4 billion, to $5.0 billion , due to the discontinuation of Infinity, the absence of the Infinity Charge (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower retail and home entertainment volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2017 decreased 7%, or $0.6 billion, to $8.2 billion, due to lower theatrical marketing costs and the discontinuation of Infinity. Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable FX Impact. \n\n&#32;Depreciation and amortization costs increased 10% , or $0.3 billion, to $2.8 billion &#32;primarily due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $98 million &#32;and $156 million &#32;of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2017 &#32;were due to severance costs and asset impairments. Charges in fiscal 2016 &#32;were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs. \n\nInterest Expense, net \n\nInterest expense, net is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(507 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(354 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(43 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and investment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(385 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(260 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(48 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances, lower capitalized interest and an increase in our effective interest rate. \n\nThe increase in interest and investment income was driven by an increase in average interest bearing cash balances and higher interest rates. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nEquity in the income of investees decreased 65% or $606 million, to $0.3 billion due to the comparison to the $332 million Vice Gain (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which was recognized in fiscal 2016, and higher losses from our investments in BAMTech and Hulu. The BAMTech results reflected a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to our acquisition of BAMTech and increased costs for technology platform investments. The decrease at Hulu was due to higher programming, distribution, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and subscription revenues. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nEffective income tax rate \n\n32.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n34.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\nppt \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to lower tax on foreign earnings, a favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement related to the tax impact of employee share-based awards ($125 million) and an increase in the benefit related to qualified domestic production activities. These decreases were partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. The lower tax on foreign earnings was driven by a decrease in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased &#32; $13 million &#32;to $386 million &#32;due to the impact of lower net income at ESPN, partially offset by the impact of improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\nCertain Items Impacting Comparability \n\nResults for fiscal 2018 were impacted by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA benefit of $1.7 billion from the Tax Act Deferred Remeasurement, net of the Deemed Repatriation Tax \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA benefit of $601 million comprising $560 million in gains from the sales of real estate and property rights, $38 million from insurance recoveries in connection with the settlement of a fiscal 2017 litigation matter and $3 million from an adjustment related to a non-cash gain recognized in fiscal 2017 for the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nImpairments of $210 million for Vice and Villages Nature equity investments \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $33 million \n\n##TABLE_END Results for fiscal 2017 were impacted by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA non-cash net gain of $255 million in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA charge, net of committed insurance recoveries, of $177 million in connection with the settlement of litigation \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $98 million \n\n##TABLE_END Results for fiscal 2016 were impacted by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA benefit of $332 million for the Vice Gain \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $156 million \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA charge of $129 million related to our Infinity game business \n\n##TABLE_END A summary of the impact of these items on EPS is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data) \n\nPre-Tax Income/(Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nTax Benefit/(Expense) (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter-Tax Income/(Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nEPS Favorable/(Adverse) &#160;(2) \n\nYear Ended September 29, 2018: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet benefit from the Tax Act \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.11 \n\nGain from sale of real estate, property rights and other \n\n&#160; \n\n(158 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.30 \n\nImpairment of equity investments \n\n(210 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(161 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.11 \n\n) \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(33 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(26 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.02 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,599 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,957 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.28 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended September 30, 2017: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSettlement of litigation \n\n$ \n\n(177 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(112 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.07 \n\n) \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(98 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(67 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.04 \n\n) \n\nGain related to the acquisition of BAMTech \n\n&#160; \n\n(93 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.10 \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n(20 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.01 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended October 1, 2016: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVice Gain \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(122 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.13 \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(156 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(113 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.07 \n\n) \n\nInfinity Charge (3) \n\n(129 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(82 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.05 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.01 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nTax benefit/expense adjustments are determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item affecting comparability. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nEPS is net of noncontrolling interest share, where applicable.

The decrease at Cable Networks was due to a decrease of 5% from lower impressions. The decrease in impressions was due to lower average viewership, partially offset by higher units delivered. The decrease at Broadcasting was due to decreases of 6% from lower network impressions and 1% from lower impressions at the owned television stations, both of which were attributed to lower average viewership. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 5% from higher network rates. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increase d $736 million &#32;due to higher ABC program sales and the consolidation of BAMTech. The increase in program sales was driven by increased revenue from programs licensed to Hulu and higher sales of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy &#32;and Black-ish. Additionally, the current year included the sales of Luke Cage , Daredevil &#32;and Jessica Jones &#32;compared to the prior-year sales of The Punisher &#32;and The Defenders . On September 25, 2017, the Company acquired a controlling ownership interest in BAMTech and began consolidating its results and including BAMTech&#8217;s revenues in other revenues. The Company&#8217;s share of BAMTech&#8217;s results was previously reported in equity in the income of investees. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increase d $654 million &#32;from $12,922 million &#32;to $13,576 million . At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increase d $332 million &#32;due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming and the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower production costs. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increase d $322 million &#32;due to higher program sales and a higher average cost of network programming, including the impact of Americal Idol , Roseanne &#32;and The Goldbergs &#32;in the current year. Other operating costs, which include distribution and technology costs, increased primarily due to the consolidation of BAMTech. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $105 million &#32;from $2,647 million &#32;to $2,752 million &#32;due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower marketing costs at the Disney Channels. \n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $89 million, from $237 million to $326 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nIncome from equity investees decrease d $213 million &#32;from $344 million &#32;to $131 million &#32;due to higher losses from Hulu and lower income from A+E. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in the prior-year period. The decrease at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. The decrease at A+E was due to lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decrease d 4%, or $277 million , to $6,625 million &#32;due to the consolidation of BAMTech and lower income from equity investees, partially offset by higher program sales and an increase at the Disney Channels. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks (1) \n\n$ \n\n17,063 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n7,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,983 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks (1) \n\n$ \n\n5,126 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,353 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n1,368 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(62 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,625 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,902 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nCable Networks results in the current year include the consolidated results of BAMTech, whereas in the prior year the Company&#8217;s share of BAMTech&#8217;s results was reported in equity in the income of investees. \n\n##TABLE_END Impairment of Equity Investments and Restructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges of $157 million, $74 million and $87 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively, which are excluded from Media Networks segment operating income.

Guest spending growth was due to higher average ticket prices for theme park admissions and for cruise line sailings, increased food, beverage, and merchandise spending and higher average daily hotel room rates. The increase in volumes was due to higher attendance and passenger cruise ship days, partially offset by lower occupied hotel room nights. Volumes benefited from a favorable comparison to the prior-year impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew. Lower occupied hotel room nights were driven by fewer available room nights at Walt Disney World Resort due to room refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units. \n\n&#32;Revenue growth at our international operations reflected increases of 5% from a favorable FX Impact, 5% from an increase in volumes and 4% from higher average guest spending. The increase in volumes was due to higher occupied room nights and attendance. Guest spending growth was driven by increases in average ticket prices, food, beverage and merchandise spending and average daily hotel room rates at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by lower average ticket prices at Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\n&#32;The following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\nParks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAttendance \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nPer Capita Guest Spending \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\nHotels &#160; (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOccupancy \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nAvailable Room Nights \n\n(in thousands) \n\n10,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,227 \n\nPer Room Guest Spending \n\n$345 \n\n&#160; \n\n$317 \n\n&#160; \n\n$297 \n\n&#160; \n\n$289 \n\n&#160; \n\n$334 \n\n&#160; \n\n$311 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nPer room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher volumes, an unfavorable FX Impact and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volumes and inflation. Higher infrastructure costs were due to increased technology spending and inflation. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased $196 million, from $1,956 million to $2,152 million primarily due to an unfavorable FX Impact, inflation and new guest offerings. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $108 million &#32;from $1,950 million &#32;to $2,058 million &#32;primarily due to inflation and an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nDepreciation and amortization increase d $157 million &#32;from $1,999 million &#32;to $2,156 million &#32;primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 18% , or $695 million , to $4.5 billion &#32;due to growth at our domestic and international operations. \n\nImpairment of Equity Investment and Restructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges of $53 million, $9 million and $17 million related to Parks and Resorts for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are excluded from Parks and Resorts segment operating income.

The Marvel titles in the current year were Avengers: Infinity War , Black Panther , Thor: Ragnarok &#32;and Ant-Man and the Wasp , whereas the prior year included Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Doctor Strange . Other significant titles in the current year included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, &#32; Incredibles 2 &#32;and Coco , while the prior year included Beauty and the Beast, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales &#32;and Moana . \n\nLower home entertainment revenue reflected a 5% decrease from lower unit sales, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher average net effective pricing. Lower unit sales were driven by the success of Moana &#32;and Finding Dory &#32;in the prior year compared to Coco &#32;and &#32;Cars 3 &#32;in the current year. The decrease was also driven by three live action titles in the prior year as compared to two live action titles in the current year and the carryover performance of fiscal 2016 new release titles in fiscal 2017 compared to the carryover performance of fiscal 2017 new release titles in fiscal 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the release of three Marvel titles and two Lucas titles in the current year compared to two Marvel titles and one Lucas \n\ntitle in the prior year. The increase in average net effective pricing was due to higher rates and a higher sales mix of Blu-ray discs, partially offset by a lower mix of new release titles. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue reflected a 4% increase from TV/SVOD distribution and a 3% increase from stage plays. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to an increase in our free television business driven by new international agreements and the sale of Star Wars: The Force Awakens &#32;in the current year with no comparable title in the prior year. Higher stage play revenue was due to the opening of additional productions in the current year. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which increase d $564 million , from $2,474 million &#32;to $3,038 million &#32;and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increase d $95 million , from $1,193 million &#32;to $1,288 million . Higher film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher theatrical distribution revenues. Higher cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to an increase in stage plays production and theatrical distribution costs. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $320 million &#32;from $2,242 million &#32;to $2,562 million &#32;primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in the current year and, to a lesser extent, higher stage play marketing costs due to additional productions in the current year. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 27% , or $625 million &#32;to $2,980 million &#32;due to an increase in theatrical distribution results. \n\nConsumer Products &#38; Interactive Media \n\nOperating results for the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLicensing, publishing and games \n\n$ \n\n3,060 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nRetail and other \n\n1,591 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n4,651 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,833 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(1,882 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,904 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(945 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,007 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(192 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(179 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n1,632 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,744 \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe decrease &#32;in licensing, publishing and games revenue was primarily due to lower revenues from sales of licensed merchandise, an unfavorable FX Impact and a decrease in licensee settlements. Lower revenues from sales of licensed merchandise includes decreases from products based on Frozen , Cars and Princess, partially offset by an increase from products based on Mickey and Minnie and Avengers. \n\nThe increase &#32;in retail and other revenue was due to lower online advertising revenue share with the Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments, an increase in sponsorship revenue and a favorable FX Impact. These increases were largely offset by a decrease in online advertising revenue and lower retail and wholesale distribution sales. The decrease in retail sales was due to lower comparable store sales, partially offset by an increase in online retail revenue. Lower comparable retail store sales reflected decreased sales of Star Wars and Moana merchandise in the current year, partially offset by higher sales of Mickey and Minnie merchandise. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a $46 million &#32; decrease &#32;in cost of goods sold and distribution costs, from $1,091 million &#32;to $1,045 million , a $33 million increase in other operating expenses, from $591 million to $624 million , and a $9 million &#32; decrease &#32;in product development expense, from $222 million &#32;to $ 213 million . The decrease in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was driven by lower royalty expense and the decrease in retail and wholesale sales, partially offset by a lower cost share with the Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments related to online advertising. The increase in other operating expenses, which include occupancy costs, labor at our retail stores and other direct costs, was driven by an unfavorable FX Impact.

The decrease at Broadcasting was due to decreases of 8% from lower network impressions and 1% from the absence of the Emmy Awards show, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. The decrease at Cable Networks was due to a decrease of 6% from lower impressions, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher rates. The decrease in impressions at Cable Networks and Broadcasting was due to lower average viewership. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue decrease d $199 million &#32;due to a decrease in program sales and an unfavorable FX Impact. The decrease in program sales was due to lower sales of cable and ABC programs. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increase d $559 million &#32;from $12,363 million &#32;to $12,922 million . At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increase d $636 million &#32;due to rate increases for NBA and, to a lesser extent, NFL and college sports programming. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decrease d $77 million &#32;due to lower program sales. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decrease d $58 million &#32;from $2,705 million to $2,647 million due to lower marketing costs at Cable Networks and a favorable FX Impact. \n\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization was driven by lower depreciation for broadcasting equipment. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nIncome from equity investees decrease d $253 million &#32;from $597 million &#32;to $344 million &#32;due to higher losses from our investments in BAMTech and Hulu. BAMTech results reflected a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to our acquisition of BAMTech and increased costs for technology platform investments. The decrease at Hulu was due to higher programming, distribution, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and subscription revenues. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decrease d 11%, or $853 million , to $6,902 million &#32;due to a decrease at ESPN and lower income from equity investees. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n16,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,632 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n6,983 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,057 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,689 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n5,353 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,965 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n1,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(42 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,902 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,755 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nParks and Resorts \n\nOperating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n$ \n\n14,812 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,242 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational \n\n3,603 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n18,415 \n\n&#160; \n\n16,974 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(10,667 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,039 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(1,950 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,913 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(1,999 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,721 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the loss of investees \n\n(25 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n3,774 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nParks and Resorts revenues increase d 8% , or $1,441 million , to $18.4 billion &#32;due to increase s of $871 million at our international operations and $570 million at our domestic operations. Revenues at our domestic operations were unfavorably impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Matthew during fiscal year 2017. \n\nRevenue growth of 32% &#32;at our international operations was due to increases of 27% from higher volumes and 4% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from an unfavorable FX Impact. Higher volumes were due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and higher attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris. \n\nHigher average guest spending was driven by an increase at Disneyland Paris and higher average ticket prices at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by lower average ticket prices at Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase at Disneyland Paris was primarily due to increases in food and beverage spending, average ticket prices and average daily hotel room rates. \n\nRevenue growth of 4% &#32;at our domestic operations was primarily due to an increase of 3% from higher average guest spending due to an increase in average ticket prices for admissions to our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, as well as higher food and beverage spending and average hotel room rates. Domestic volumes were comparable to fiscal year 2016 as increased attendance at Walt Disney World Resort was largely offset by lower occupied room nights at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort. At Walt Disney World Resort, available hotel room nights decreased due to refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\nParks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAttendance \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nPer Capita Guest Spending \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nHotels &#160;(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOccupancy \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAvailable Room Nights (in thousands) \n\n10,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,382 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,600 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,227 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,982 \n\nPer Room Guest Spending \n\n$317 \n\n&#160; \n\n$305 \n\n&#160; \n\n$292 \n\n&#160; \n\n$278 \n\n&#160; \n\n$312 \n\n&#160; \n\n$301 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nPer room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was primarily due to inflation and a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. Higher infrastructure costs were driven by a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in cost of sales was due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort, inflation and higher volumes. Other operating expenses, which include costs for items such as supplies, commissions and entertainment, increased due to new guest offerings and a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $37 million &#32;from $1,913 million &#32;to $1,950 million &#32;due to higher domestic marketing spend, partially offset by lower marketing spend for Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\n&#32;Depreciation and amortization increase d $278 million &#32;from $1,721 million &#32;to $1,999 million &#32;primarily due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nEquity in the Loss of Investees \n\nLoss from equity investees increased $22 million to $25 million due to a higher operating loss from Disneyland Paris&#8217; 50% joint venture interest in Villages Nature. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 14% , or $476 million , to $3.8 billion &#32;due to growth at our international and domestic operations. \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheatrical distribution \n\n$ \n\n2,903 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,672 \n\n&#160; \n\n(21 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nHome entertainment \n\n1,798 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other \n\n3,678 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,661 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n8,379 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,441 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(3,667 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,991 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(2,242 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,622 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(115 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(125 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n2,355 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,703 \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nThe decrease &#32;in theatrical distribution revenue was primarily due to the comparison of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and two Pixar titles in release in fiscal year 2016 compared to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &#32;and one Pixar title in release in fiscal year 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the performance of Beauty and the Beast &#32;and two Marvel titles in fiscal year 2017 compared to The Jungle Book &#32;and one Marvel title in fiscal year 2016. Other significant titles in fiscal year 2017 included Moana and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales , while fiscal year 2016 included Zootopia &#32;and Alice Through the Looking Glass. \n\nLower home entertainment revenue was due to a decrease of 16% from a decline in unit sales driven by lower sales of Star Wars Classic titles and the performance of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &#32;in fiscal year 2017 compared to the strong performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens &#32;in fiscal year 2016. Fiscal year 2017 also included the release of one Pixar title, compared to two Pixar titles in fiscal year 2016. These decreases were partially offset by the success of Moana, Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 &#32;in fiscal year 2017 compared to Zootopia , Captain America: Civil War &#32;and The Jungle Book &#32;in fiscal year 2016. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was flat as increases of 5% from TV/SVOD distribution, 1% from stage plays and 1% from Lucasfilm&#8217;s special effects business were offset by a decrease of 7% from lower revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to international growth and higher domestic rates, partially offset by a decrease due to a domestic sale of Star Wars Classic titles in fiscal year 2016. Higher stage play revenue was driven by new productions opening in fiscal year 2017, while higher revenue from Lucasfilm&#8217;s special effects business was driven by more projects in fiscal year 2017. Lower revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment was due to the stronger performance of merchandise based on Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Frozen &#32;in fiscal year 2016, partially offset by Cars merchandise in fiscal year 2017. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which decrease d $149 million , from $2,623 million &#32;to $2,474 million &#32;and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decrease d $175 million , from $1,368 million &#32;to $1,193 million . Lower film cost amortization was due to the impact of lower revenues, partially offset by a higher average amortization rate &#32; in fiscal year 2017. Lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs were primarily due to a decrease in theatrical distribution costs and a decline in home entertainment unit sales. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decrease d $380 million &#32;from $2,622 million &#32;to $2,242 million &#32;primarily due to lower theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal year 2016, which also included the release of two DreamWorks titles, Pete&#8217;s Dragon &#32;and The Finest Hours . \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 13%, or $348 million &#32;to $2,355 million &#32;due to a decrease in theatrical distribution results, lower revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment and a decrease in home entertainment results.

Lower games revenue was due to the discontinuation of Infinity in fiscal year 2016 and decreased licensing revenue from Star Wars: Battlefront. The decrease at our merchandise licensing business was due to lower revenue in fiscal year 2017 from merchandise based on Star Wars and Frozen and an unfavorable FX Impact, partially offset by a benefit from licensee settlements and higher revenue from merchandise based on Cars. The decrease at our publishing business was primarily due to lower sales of licensed and self-published books based on Star Wars and Frozen &#32;and a decrease in sales of comic books based on Star Wars. \n\nThe decrease &#32;in retail and other revenue was due to a decrease of 9% from our retail business driven by lower comparable store and online sales in our key markets, reflecting higher sales of Frozen &#32;and Star Wars merchandise in fiscal year 2016, partially offset by sales of Moana &#32;merchandise in fiscal year 2017. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a $249 million &#32; decrease &#32;in cost of goods sold and distribution costs, from $1,340 million &#32;to $1,091 million , a $2 million &#32; increase &#32;in labor and occupancy costs, from $539 million &#32;to $541 million , and a $96 million &#32; decrease &#32;in product development expense, from $318 million &#32;to $222 million . The decrease in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to the discontinuation of Infinity, lower retail sales and the decrease in sales of books and comics. Lower product development expense was primarily due to the discontinuation of Infinity and fewer mobile games in development. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decrease d $118 million &#32;from $1,125 million &#32;to $1,007 million &#32;primarily due to the discontinuation of Infinity and a favorable FX Impact. The discontinuation of Infinity resulted in lower marketing costs. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decrease d 11% , or $221 million , to $1.7 billion &#32;due to lower results at our merchandise licensing, retail and publishing businesses, partially offset by an improvement at our games business. \n\nCORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Better/(Worse) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(761 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(582 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(640 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(31 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2018 increased $179 million to $761 million &#32;from $582 million &#32;in fiscal 2017 primarily due to costs related to the 21CF acquisition and higher compensation costs. Corporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2017 decreased $58 million to $582 million &#32;from $640 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 due to lower compensation costs, partially offset by higher charitable contributions. \n\nIMPACT OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX REFORM \n\nAs discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Tax Act resulted in the following impacts to the Company (the amounts recorded in fiscal 2018 are provisional and will be finalized during the first quarter of fiscal 2019): \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s federal statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35.0% to 24.5% for fiscal 2018 and to 21.0% for following years. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nFor the year ended September 29, 2018, the Company recognized a net benefit of $1.7 billion, which reflected a $2.1 billion benefit from the Deferred Remeasurement, partially offset by a charge of $0.4 billion for the Deemed Repatriation Tax. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGenerally, there will no longer be a U.S. federal income tax cost on the repatriation of foreign earnings. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company will generally be eligible to claim an immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets acquired and film and television productions that commenced after September 27, 2017 and are placed in service during fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. This provision phases out through fiscal 2027. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCertain provisions of the Act are not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019 including: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe elimination of the domestic production activities deduction. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe taxation of certain foreign derived income in the U.S. at an effective rate of approximately 13% (which increases to approximately 16% in 2025) rather than the general statutory rate of 21%. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA minimum effective tax on certain foreign earnings of approximately 13%. \n\n##TABLE_END We are continuing to assess the impacts of these provisions to our fiscal 2019 effective income tax rate. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWe expect a cash tax benefit similar to the reduction in the statutory rate, as well as a benefit from the immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets and film and television productions. \n\n##TABLE_END The U.S. Treasury and other tax authorities continue to issue guidance impacting the application of the Tax Act on the Company, and accordingly, our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act is not final. \n\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS \n\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company launched ESPN+ and continued the development of Disney+, which is scheduled to launch in the U.S. in late 2019. As we intend to use certain of our film and television content on the Disney+ service, in the short term we expect to forgo certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties. In addition, we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for the DTC services. \n\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company announced a strategic reorganization of its businesses into the following operating segments: the newly-formed Direct-to-Consumer and International segment; the combined Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products segment; Media Networks; and Studio Entertainment. The Company is in the process of modifying internal reporting processes and systems to accommodate the new structure and will report under the new segment structure in fiscal 2019. The chief operating decision maker received information and assessed performance during 2018 based on historic operating segments. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,295 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,343 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,136 \n\nCash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,336 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,111 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,758 \n\n) \n\nCash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,843 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,959 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,220 \n\n) \n\nImpact of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n\n&#160; \n\n(25 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(123 \n\n) \n\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(696 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased &#32; 16% &#32;or $2.0 billion &#32;to $14.3 billion &#32;compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the Tax Act, a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts, partially offset by lower operating cash flow at Media Networks and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in New York. The increase in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. Parks and Resorts cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue, partially offset by higher spending on labor and other costs. Lower operating cash flow at Media Networks was due to higher television production spending. \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 decreased &#32; 6% &#32;or $0.8 billion &#32;to $12.3 billion &#32;compared to fiscal 2016 due to a decrease in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment and an increase in pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher operating cash flow at Parks and Resorts and lower tax payments. The decrease in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment was due to lower operating cash receipts driven by a decrease in revenue and higher film production spending.

The increase at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland \n\nResort, while the increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to spending on new attractions at Disneyland Resort. The decrease in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower spending at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. \n\nCapital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. The increase at cable networks in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending at BAMTech. \n\nCapital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. \n\nThe Company currently expects its fiscal 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion higher than fiscal 2018 capital expenditures of $4.5 billion &#32;due to increased investments at our domestic and international parks and resorts. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nThe fiscal 2018 spending of $1.6 billion on acquisitions was for the September 2017 acquisition of BAMTech. Cash provided by other investing activities of $710 million reflected $1.2 billion of cash received in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights, partially offset by contributions of $442 million to a joint venture. \n\nThe fiscal 2017 spending of $417 million on acquisitions was for the January 2017 acquisition of additional interests in BAMTech for $557 million, partially offset by $140 million of cash assumed upon the consolidation of BAMTech. Cash used in other investing activities of $71 million reflected $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions. \n\nThe fiscal 2016 spending of $850 million on acquisitions was for a 15% interest in BAMTech and an 11% interest in Vice. Cash used in other investing activities of $135 million reflected $109 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases and $74 million in premiums paid for foreign currency option contracts in connection with our commitment to acquire two new cruise ships. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash used in financing activities was $ 8.8 billion &#32;in fiscal 2018 &#32;compared to $ 9.0 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 . The net use of cash in the current year was due to $3.6 billion &#32;of common stock repurchases, $2.5 billion &#32;in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of $2.6 billion . Cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 &#32;as lower common stock repurchases ( $3.6 billion &#32;in fiscal 2018 &#32;compared to $9.4 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 ) and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.4 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in the current year compared to a net increase in borrowings in the prior year ($2.6 billion decrease in fiscal 2018 &#32;compared to $3.7 billion &#32;increase in fiscal 2017 ). \n\nCash used in financing activities was $ 9.0 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $7.2 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 . The net use of cash in fiscal 2017 &#32;was due to $9.4 billion &#32;of common stock repurchases, $2.4 billion &#32;in dividends and $0.8 billion in payments to noncontrolling interest holders, partially offset by net borrowings of $3.7 billion . The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to fiscal 2016 &#32;was due to higher common stock repurchases ($9.4 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.5 billion in fiscal 2016). \n\nDuring the year ended September 29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s borrowing activity was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nBorrowings \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\nActivity \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\nCommercial paper with original maturities less than three months, net (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,151 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,099 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nCommercial paper with original maturities greater than three months \n\n&#160; \n\n1,621 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,748 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. and European medium-term notes \n\n&#160; \n\n19,721 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,800 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n17,942 \n\nAsia Theme Parks borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n1,145 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,145 \n\nBAMTech acquisition payable \n\n&#160; \n\n1,581 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,581 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nForeign currency denominated debt and other (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,056 \n\n&#160; \n\n(71 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(275 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,291 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,135 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(13,299 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(253 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,874 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nBorrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nThe other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#8217;s bank facilities.

However, the Company&#8217;s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company&#8217;s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company&#8217;s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 29, 2018 , Moody&#8217;s Investors Service&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, Standard and Poor&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A+ and A-1, and Fitch&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F1, respectively. Each of Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch had placed the Company&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings on review for downgrade as a result of the pending acquisition of 21CF. On October 8, 2018, Moody&#8217;s Investor Service affirmed the Company&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings of A2 and P-1, respectively, following its review of the impact of the acquisition. The Company currently expects Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Fitch to finalize its review of the Company&#8217;s debt ratings upon closing of the acquisition and one or more of the agencies may downgrade our long and short-term debt ratings. Should a downgrade occur, we do not anticipate that it would impact our ability to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 29, 2018 , by a significant margin. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nThe Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 29, 2018 &#32;and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. \n\nAdditional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than \n\n1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1-3 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\n4-5 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than \n\n5 Years \n\nBorrowings (Note 8) (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,240 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,412 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,095 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,803 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,930 \n\nOperating lease commitments (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n3,584 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,041 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,220 \n\nCapital lease obligations (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSports programming commitments (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n42,536 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,835 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,291 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,194 \n\nBroadcast programming commitments (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n2,077 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sports and other broadcast programming commitments \n\n&#160; \n\n44,613 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,340 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,752 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,680 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,841 \n\nOther (2) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,294 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,793 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,837 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,996 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,668 \n\nTotal contractual obligations (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n84,271 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,765 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,155 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,101 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nExcludes market value adjustments, which reduce recorded borrowings by $304 million .

For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFilm and Television Revenues and Costs \n\nWe expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period&#8217;s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. \n\nWith respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from \n\nother markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film&#8217;s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company&#8217;s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. \n\nWith respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company&#8217;s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, SVOD services and in home entertainment formats. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. \n\nWe expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program&#8217;s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season&#8217;s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. \n\nCosts of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company&#8217;s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies. \n\nWe reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated. \n\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. \n\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for \n\nsetting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 4.31% &#32;at the end of fiscal 2018 &#32;from 3.88% &#32;at the end of fiscal 2017 &#32;to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2018 year end measurement date. The Company&#8217;s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans&#8217; liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2019 &#32;by approximately $241 million &#32;and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 29, 2018 &#32;by approximately $2.7 billion . A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $229 million &#32;and $2.3 billion , respectively. \n\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2019 &#32;annual benefit expense by approximately $135 million . \n\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments \n\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nTo determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. \n\nIn times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company&#8217;s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. \n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group&#8217;s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group&#8217;s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset&#8217;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and \n\nmarket values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. \n\nThe Company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $210 million , $22 million &#32;and $7 million &#32;in fiscal years 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. The fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in &#8220; Equity in the income (loss) of investees, net &#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fiscal 2017 and 2016 impairment charges were recorded in &#8220;Restructuring and impairment charges&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nWe evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. \n\nContingencies and Litigation \n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. \n\nIncome Tax Audits \n\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company&#8217;s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company&#8217;s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are &#8220;forward-looking,&#8221; including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management&#8217;s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 131, "Negative": 226, "Polarity": -0.2661064418316346, "Subjectivity": 0.0494596841161735}, "similarity_score": 0.9956403837186535, "nlp_result": 0}
