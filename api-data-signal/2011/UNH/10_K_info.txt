Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. \n\nUnitedHealthcare serves the health benefits needs of individuals across life's stages through three businesses. UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual serves individual consumers and employers. The unique health needs of seniors are served by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State serves the public health marketplace, offering states innovative Medicaid solutions. \n\nOptum serves health system participants including consumers, physicians, hospitals, governments, insurers, distributors and pharmaceutical companies, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses. \n\nRevenues \n\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers&#8217; health care benefits and related administrative costs. Effective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, subject to state-specific exceptions) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. As a result, our quarterly premium revenue may be reduced by a pro rata estimate of our full-year premium rebate payable under the Health Reform Legislation. Any required rebate payments for the current year are made in the third quarter of the subsequent year. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees&#8217; dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from our Optum businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities; investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nMedical Costs. &#32;Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. \n\nMedical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. \n\nOur medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, rebates, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. \n\nOperating Costs. &#32;Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. \n\nCash Flows \n\nWe generate cash primarily from premiums, service and product revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs, payments on debt, purchases of investments, acquisitions, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. For more information on our cash flows, see &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; below. \n\nBusiness Trends \n\nOur businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 18% of U.S. gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of \n\noperations. \n\nIn 2012, we expect increasing unit costs to continue to be the primary cost driver of medical cost trends and we project steadily increasing medical system utilization over the course of the year. We also expect an increase in prescription drug costs. We will continue to work to manage medical cost trends through care management programs, affordable network relationships, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers, and targeted clinical management programs and initiatives focused on improving quality and affordability. Additionally, employers are continuing to select products with benefit designs that shift more of the costs to the employee. This cost shifting continues to mitigate increases in medical cost trends. \n\nOur businesses focus on affordability, consumer empowerment, wellness and prevention, payment innovations, and enhanced distribution to better serve our customer and consumer needs and demands. These business objectives are consistent with the goals of health care reform. We expect that the portion of our costs that is tied to incentive contracts that reward providers for outcome-based results and improved cost efficiencies will continue to increase. Care providers are facing market pressures to change from fee-for-service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer, integrated care across care providers and pay-for-performance payment structures. This is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems. The impact of such changes on our results of operations is uncertain but, we expect them to moderate the rate at which medical costs increase. This trend also provides growth opportunities for our OptumHealth and OptumInsight businesses. \n\nWe attempt to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, competitive dynamics and premium rebates at the local market level. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs and Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. In 2012, we continue to expect reimbursements to be under pressure through government payment rates and continued market competition in commercial products. \n\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties \n\nIn the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. HHS, the DOL, the IRS and the Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation, all of which have a variety of effective dates, remain pending. \n\nThe Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth and restrict premium rate increases in certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs, or expose us to an increased risk of liability, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\nWe also anticipate that the Health Reform Legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality, with a focus on prevention, wellness and disease management. We believe demand for many of our service offerings, such as consulting services, data management, information technology and related infrastructure construction, disease management, and population-based health and wellness programs will continue to grow. \n\nFollowing is a listing of some of the key provisions of the Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items along with management's view of the related trends and uncertainties that may cause reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating performance or of future financial condition. \n\nPremium Rebates \n\nEffective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. The potential for and size of the rebates are measured by state, by group size and by licensed subsidiary. \n\nIn the aggregate, the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained. \n\nThe disaggregation of insurance pools into smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed. \n\nOther market participants could implement changes to their business practices in response to the Health Reform Legislation, which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share. Insurers could elect to change pricing, modify product features or benefits, adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market. They could also seek to adjust \n\ntheir operating costs by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services. We have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to the Health Reform Legislation, including reducing producer commissions, and are implementing changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment. These changes could impact future growth in these products. \n\nCommercial Rate Increase Review \n\nThe Health Reform Legislation also requires HHS to maintain an annual review of &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% (with state-specific thresholds to be applicable commencing September 2012), and clarified that the HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10% (or applicable state threshold) or more. Under the regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets. \n\nThe Federal government is also encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by affected commercial health plans (including large group plans) and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. Since August 2010, HHS has allocated approximately $250 million for grants to states to enable the states to conduct more robust reviews of requests for premium increases. Many states have applied for and received grants, and state regulators have signaled their intent to more closely scrutinize premium rates. \n\nPremium rate review legislation (ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements) has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states in 2011. As a result, we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California, New York and Rhode Island. Depending on the level of scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression. \n\nMedicare Advantage Rates \n\nAs part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage risk adjusted benchmarks, which ultimately drive our CMS payments, were reduced by 1.6% in 2011 from 2010 levels. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks have taken effect (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. These changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels. \n\nWe expect the 2012 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. There are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, adjust members' benefits and decide on a county-by-county basis in which geographies to participate. \n\nAdditionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the increases in the number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement insurance offerings. \n\nIt is also anticipated that CMS will release the final Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit methodology in 2012. RADV audits are intended to validate that the risk-adjusted payments Medicare Advantage plans receive are supported by medical record data. Depending upon the final RADV methodology released by CMS, recoveries from RADV audits may result in additional rate pressure. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; \n\nBudget Control Act's Medicare Sequestration \n\nCongress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, following the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to cut the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion, triggers automatic across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration), including Medicare spending cuts averaging 2% of total program costs for nine years, starting in 2013. Medicare payments exempted from sequestration include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPart D low-income subsidies; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPart D catastrophic subsidies; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPayments to states for coverage of Medicare cost-sharing for certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries. \n\n##TABLE_END 32 \n\nThe Office of Management and Budget is responsible for determining, calculating and implementing cuts. We are exploring strategies to mitigate any impact that may result from the cuts beginning in 2013. \n\nInsurance Industry Fee \n\nThe Health Reform Legislation includes an annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter). The annual fee will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity's net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions and uncertainties. \n\nOur effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 due to the non-deductibility of these fees. \n\nPremium increases will be necessary to offset the impact of these and other provisions. Premium increases are generally subject to state regulatory approval and potentially to federal review. Other market participants could increase premiums at different levels which could impact our market share positively or negatively. \n\nState-based Exchanges and Coverage Expansion \n\nEffective in 2014, exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers as well as certain CHIP eligibles. The exchanges will be state-based. If a state fails to establish an exchange by the required deadline, exchanges may be administered through a federal/state partnership or by the federal government. \n\nAmong other things, the Health Reform Legislation eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits and restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded. The Health Reform Legislation also provides for expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. The Health Reform Legislation includes an MOE provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by Medicaid, until the Secretary of HHS determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state. The MOE provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above 133% of the federal poverty level from Medicaid before implementation of expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. However, states with, or projecting, a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the MOE provision. Additionally, individual states may accelerate their procurement of Medicaid managed care services in 2012 and 2013 for sizeable groups of Medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads in advance of Medicaid market expansion taking place in 2014. \n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that up to 34 million additional individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the Health Reform Legislation is implemented broadly in its current form. This represents an opportunity for us to increase membership. However, serving these individuals may generate different profit margins than our existing business due to various factors, including the health status of the newly insured individuals. \n\nWe expect existing participants in Medicare and Medicaid and new enrollees in state-based exchanges to transition between products and programs, offering us opportunities to design products and services that enable us to compete for new business across business segments on an ongoing basis. An acceleration of Medicaid managed care services could increase near-term business growth opportunities for UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State. However, if states are successful in obtaining MOE waivers and allow certain Medicaid programs to expire, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment. \n\nCourt Proceedings \n\nCourt proceedings related to the Health Reform Legislation continue to evolve. These court proceedings, and the potential for Congressional action to impede implementation, create additional uncertainties with respect to the law. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation, see Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Regulation&#8221; and Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nRESULTS SUMMARY ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 vs. 2010 \n\n&#160; \n\n2010 vs. 2009 \n\nRevenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPremiums \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n91,983 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n85,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n79,315 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,578 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,090 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nServices \n\n&#160; \n\n6,613 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,819 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,306 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProducts \n\n&#160; \n\n2,612 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,925 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment and other income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n101,862 \n\n&#160; \n\n94,155 \n\n&#160; \n\n87,138 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,707 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,017 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating costs: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMedical costs \n\n&#160; \n\n74,332 \n\n&#160; \n\n68,841 \n\n&#160; \n\n65,289 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,491 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,552 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating costs \n\n&#160; \n\n15,557 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,270 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,734 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,287 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,536 \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of products sold \n\n&#160; \n\n2,385 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,116 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,765 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n1,124 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,064 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal operating costs \n\n&#160; \n\n93,398 \n\n&#160; \n\n86,291 \n\n&#160; \n\n80,779 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,107 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,512 \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings from operations \n\n&#160; \n\n8,464 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,864 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,359 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,505 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n(505 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(481 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(551 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(70 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n) \n\nEarnings before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n7,959 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,383 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,808 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,575 \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,817 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,749 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,986 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet earnings \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,142 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,634 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,822 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nDiluted net earnings per common share \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.10 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.24 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.63 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.86 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nMedical care ratio (a) \n\n&#160; \n\n80.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n80.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n82.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating cost ratio (b) \n\n&#160; \n\n15.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n15.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating margin \n\n&#160; \n\n8.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n7.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n35.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n37.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n34.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet margin \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReturn on equity (c) \n\n&#160; \n\n18.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n18.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n17.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (a) \n\nMedical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) \n\nOperating cost ratio is calculated as operating costs divided by total revenues. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) \n\nReturn on equity is calculated as net earnings divided by average equity.

Unit cost increases represented the majority of the increases in our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. \n\nFor each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2011 &#32;and 2010 &#32;there was $720 million &#32;and $800 million , respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels. The favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nThe increase in our operating costs for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;was due to business growth, including an increased mix of Optum and UnitedHealthcare fee-based and service revenues, which have higher operating costs, and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance. These factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. \n\nIncome Tax Rate \n\nThe effective income tax rate for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010, due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the Health Reform Legislation. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nOur two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, are comprised of four reportable segments: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumHealth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumInsight; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumRx. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of our reportable segments derives its revenues. \n\nTransactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and clinical services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management&#8217;s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. \n\nOn January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our business realignment.

We believe that we will grow from this level throughout the course of the year in the open retail market. \n\nIn February 2012, we added 117,000 Medicare Advantage members from the acquisition of XLHealth Corporation. \n\nOptum. &#32;Total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at OptumHealth and OptumInsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at OptumRx. \n\nOptum&#8217;s operating margin for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;was down compared to 2010. The decrease was due to changes in business mix within Optum&#8217;s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements. \n\nThe results by segment were as follows: \n\nOptumHealth \n\nIncreased revenues at OptumHealth for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services, as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings. \n\nEarnings from operations for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;and operating margin decreased compared to 2010. The decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services. \n\nOptumInsight \n\nIncreased revenues at OptumInsight for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;were due to the impact of organic growth and the full-year impact of 2010 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in June 2011. \n\nThe increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. \n\nOptumRx \n\nThe increase in OptumRx revenues for the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 &#32;was due to increased prescription volumes, primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement business, and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $16.7 billion &#32;and $14.4 billion &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. \n\nOptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 &#32;decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and Medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications. \n\nWe will consolidate and manage the majority of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs internally when our contract with Medco Health Solutions, Inc. expires at the end of 2012. The investments in our infrastructure and to expand our capacity will likely cause a decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin as in 2012, OptumRx expects to absorb approximately $115 million of the $150 million consolidated in-sourcing related operating costs. As a result of this transition, OptumRx expects to add 12 million members on a staged basis in 2013. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of certain risks associated with the transition of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs to OptumRx. \n\n2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2009 RESULTS \n\nConsolidated Financial Results \n\nRevenues \n\nThe increases in revenues for 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth. \n\nMedical Costs and Medical Care Ratio \n\nMedical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs. \n\nFor 2010 and 2009, there was $800 million and $310 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. \n\nThe medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services, successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nOperating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses, goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at OptumInsight, which is discussed in more detail below, an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the Medicare Advantage annual enrollment period, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs. \n\nIncome Tax Rate \n\nThe increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation due to the Health Reform Legislation. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nUnitedHealthcare \n\nThe revenue growth in UnitedHealthcare for 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases. \n\nUnitedHealthcare earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above, continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental \n\ncustomers, a general moderation in year-over-year growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs. \n\nOptumHealth \n\nIncreased revenues in OptumHealth for 2010 were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets. \n\nThe operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the federal Mental Health Parity &#38; Addiction Equity Act of 2008. \n\nOptumInsight \n\nIncreased revenues in OptumInsight for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance. \n\nThe decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. In addition, increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. \n\nOptumRx \n\nThe increased OptumRx revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement business and higher prescription volumes. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $14.4 billion and $12.5 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\nOptumRx operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management. \n\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity \n\nIntroduction \n\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. The risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses, geographies and customers; our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses; and continued productivity improvements that lower our operating costs. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment-grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors' approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital through risk tolerances around liquidity, credit quality, issuer limits, asset class diversification, income and duration. The policy emphasizes investment grade bonds with durations that are short to intermediate term in nature. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations and tax implications. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary&#8217;s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as &#8220;ordinary dividends&#8221; and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an &#8220;extraordinary dividend&#8221; and must receive prior regulatory approval. \n\nIn 2011, based on the 2010 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.4 billion . For the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion , including $1.1 billion &#32;of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $686 million &#32;of extraordinary dividends. \n\nOur non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. \n\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSources of cash: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,968 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,625 \n\nIssuance of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nInterest rate swap termination \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nProceeds from customer funds administered \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and maturities of investments, net of purchases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sources of cash \n\n&#160; \n\n8,123 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,633 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,895 \n\nUses of cash: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommon stock repurchases \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,994 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,517 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,801 \n\n) \n\nPurchases of investments, net of sales and maturities \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,695 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,157 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,459 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,304 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(486 \n\n) \n\nPurchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net of dispositions \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,018 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(878 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(739 \n\n) \n\nDividends paid \n\n&#160; \n\n(651 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(449 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\nRepayments of long-term debt and commercial paper \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,449 \n\n) \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\nTotal uses of cash \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,817 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,310 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,521 \n\n) \n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(677 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,374 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n2011 Cash Flows Compared to 2010 Cash Flows \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $695 million , or 11% , from 2010. The increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts, which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state Medicaid premium payments in 2010, which increased 2010 cash from operating activities. We anticipate lower year over year cash flows from operations in 2012, which will include payments in the third quarter for 2011 premium rebate obligations. \n\nCash flows used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion , or 22% , primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments. We anticipate an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2012 as compared to 2011. \n\nCash flows used for financing activities increased $879 million , or 55% , primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings. \n\n2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $648 million, or 12%, for 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments, and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections, which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program and payment for the settlement of the American Medical Association class action litigation \n\nrelated to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services. \n\nCash flows used for investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010, decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and the use of operating cash to purchase investments. \n\nCash flows used for financing activities decreased $664 million, or 29%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock. \n\nFinancial Condition \n\nAs of December 31, 2011 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.0 billion &#32;included $9.4 billion &#32;of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.6 billion &#32;was held by non-regulated entities), $18.0 billion &#32;of debt securities and $544 million &#32;of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. We had $417 million &#32;of Level 3 securities as of December 31, 2011 . Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $3.0 billion &#32;bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. \n\nOur cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2011 . Included in the debt securities balance are $2.4 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2011 . We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. \n\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity \n\nIn addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: \n\nCommercial Paper. &#32;We maintain a commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $3.0 billion &#32;bank credit facility described below. As of December 31, 2011 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. \n\nBank Credit Facility . &#32;In December 2011 , we amended and renewed our five-year revolving bank credit facility with 21 &#32;banks, which will mature in December 2016 . The amendment included increasing the borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion . This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2011 . The interest rate on borrowings is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011 , the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 1.2% &#32;to 1.7% . \n\nOur bank credit facility contains various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio below 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders&#8217; equity, was 29.1% &#32;and 30.1% &#32;as of December 31, 2011 &#32;and December 31, 2010 , respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2011 . \n\nLong-term debt. &#32;Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes and the funds may be used, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions, for share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes. \n\nIn November 2011, we issued $1.5 billion &#32;in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $400 million &#32;of 1.9% &#32;fixed-rate notes due November 2016, $500 million &#32;of 3.4% &#32;fixed-rate notes due November 2021 and $600 million &#32;of 4.6% &#32;notes due November 2041. \n\nIn February 2011, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $400 million of 4.7% fixed-rate \n\nnotes due February 2021 and $350 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due February 2041. \n\nCredit Ratings. &#32;Our credit ratings at December 31, 2011 &#32;were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nStandard &#38; Poor&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nFitch \n\n&#160; \n\nA.M.

For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. \n\nShare Repurchases. &#32;Under our Board of Directors&#8217; authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured repurchase programs), subject to certain preset parameters established by our Board. In May 2011 , our Board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million &#32;shares of our common stock. During the year &#32;ended December 31, 2011 , we repurchased 65 million &#32;shares at an average price of approximately $46 &#32;per share and an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion . As of December 31, 2011 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 65 million shares of our common stock. \n\nDividends. &#32;In May 2011 , our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.65 &#32;per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2010 , we had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 &#32;per share. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. On February 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1625 per share. \n\nThe following table provides details of our dividend payments and annual dividend rate: \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount Paid per Share \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Amount Paid \n\n&#160; \n\nAnnual Dividend Rate per Share \n\nat December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.0300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.03 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4050 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.50 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6125 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.65 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2011 , under our various contractual obligations and commitments: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2013 to 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\n2015 to 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nDebt (a) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,580 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,551 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,529 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,097 \n\nOperating leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,601 \n\nPurchase obligations (b) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFuture policy benefits (c) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,917 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,570 \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits (d) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,459 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,669 \n\nOther obligations (f) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,477 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,441 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,167 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,695 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (a) \n\nIncludes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values.

This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. \n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nAs of December 31, 2011 , we were not involved in off-balance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nIn July 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06, &#8220;Other Expenses (Topic 720): Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force&#8221; (ASU 2011-06). This update addresses the recognition and classification of an entity's share of the annual health insurance industry assessment (the fee) mandated by Health Reform Legislation. The fee will be levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of an entity's net health premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year. In accordance with the amendments in ASU 2011-06, our liability for the fee will be estimated and recorded in full once we provide qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable (first applicable in 2014) with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable. \n\nWe have determined that there have been no other recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nMedical Costs \n\nEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions. \n\nEach period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2011 , 2010 &#32;and 2009 , included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $720 million , $800 million &#32;and $310 million , respectively. This development represented approximately 8%, 9% and 4% of the medical claims payable balance as of December 31, 2010 , 2009 &#32;and 2008, respectively. \n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. \n\nCompletion Factors. &#32;Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2011 : \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Completion Factors \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nIn Medical Costs Payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n(0.75)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.50) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.25) \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25 \n\n&#160; \n\n(70 \n\n) \n\n0.50 \n\n&#160; \n\n(139 \n\n) \n\n0.75 \n\n&#160; \n\n(208 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMedical cost PMPM trend factors. &#32;Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2011 : \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Medical Costs PMPM Trend \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nIn Medical Costs Payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n3% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2 \n\n&#160; \n\n1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(138 \n\n) \n\n(2) \n\n&#160; \n\n(277 \n\n) \n\n(3) \n\n&#160; \n\n(415 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \n\nOur estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2011 , developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2011 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2011 &#32;estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2011 &#32;net earnings would have increased or decreased by $56 million and diluted net earnings per common share would have increased or decreased by $0.05 per share. \n\nThe current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. \n\nWe believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable \n\nregulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. \n\nRevenues \n\nRevenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Effective in 2011, premium revenue subject to the premium rebates of the Health Reform Legislation are recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract, when that amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated premium is revised each period to reflect current experience. The most significant factors in estimating these rebates are financial performance within each aggregation set, including medical claim experience and effective tax rates, as well as changes in business mix and regulatory requirements. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. \n\nOur Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and other health care plans collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS' retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Medicare Advantage risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. \n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. \n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. \n\nForecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategy. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevenue trends. Key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions around unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMedical cost trends. See further discussion of medical costs trends within Medical Costs above. Similar factors are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCapital levels. The capital structure and requirements for each business is considered. \n\n##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the \n\nlong-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Regulation&#8221;. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I and \"Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\" above. \n\nDiscount rates are determined for each reporting unit based on the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. \n\nThe passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units' operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. \n\nWe elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2012. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values, thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2011. \n\nIntangible assets. Finite-lived, separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). We do not have material holdings of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values and are then amortized over their expected useful lives. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles which represent 88% of our total intangible balance of $2.8 billion . \n\nCustomer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rate, perpetuity growth rate and discount rate. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). \n\nOur intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of an intangible asset, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. \n\nThere were no material impairments of finite-lived intangible assets during 2011. \n\nInvestments \n\nAs of December 31, 2011 , we had investments with a carrying value of $18.7 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders' equity. \n\nWe continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2011 , our investments had gross unrealized gains of $787 million &#32;and gross unrealized losses of $32 million . We evaluate investments for impairment considering factors including: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. \n\n##TABLE_END 47 \n\nFor debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. \n\nFor equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security's cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in through our income statement. \n\nInherently, there is uncertainty included in the impairment assessment of investments. Our analysis includes significant judgments and estimates including: the fair value of the investment, the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the issuer other forms of credit enhancements, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and general industry and sector economic conditions. \n\nFair values. We perform an analysis around the fair values of the securities held including obtaining an understanding of the pricing method and procedures over the valuation of securities. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, its custodian, its investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nchanges in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. \n\nOther-than-temporary impairment assessment. &#32; Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the factors above including: the length of time of impairment, credit standing, financial condition, near term-prospects and other factors specific to the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, the primary causes of historical impairments were market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations, etc) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Generally, we do not assume that we will be required &#32; to sell a security because our large cash holdings reduce this risk. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. \n\nWe believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $12 million , $23 million &#32;and $64 million , respectively. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2011. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. \n\nThe judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial \n\ncondition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. \n\nAs discussed further in Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" a 1% increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $622 million . \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. \n\nWe have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence (both positive and negative) for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. \n\nAccording to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. \n\nWe have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. \n\nThe significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2011 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $80 million. \n\nContingent Liabilities \n\nBecause of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. \n\nEstimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. \n\nGiven this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. \n\nLEGAL MATTERS \n\nA description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference in this report. \n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK \n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2011 , we had an aggregate $1.9 billion &#32;reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as &#8220;A+.&#8221; As of December 31, 2011 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 180, "Negative": 239, "Polarity": -0.14081145551118984, "Subjectivity": 0.05851138108385541}, "similarity_score": 0.8481055286451196, "nlp_result": 0}
