The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report . \n\nOverview \n\nVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services we provide. \n\nOverall economic conditions and regulatory environment. &#32;Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2012 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act. &#32;As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide interchange fees charged before the Dodd-Frank Act was implemented. The Federal Reserve has also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. \n\nThe interchange, exclusivity and routing regulations have impacted our pricing, reduced the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process and decreased associated revenues. A number of our clients have sought fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have reduced the number of debit cards they issue and reduced investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some have imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand-deposit account relationships. Some have elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. Additionally, the routing regulations have allowed merchants to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. \n\nWe have had to re-examine and renegotiate certain of our client contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations and will continue to do so with others. As a result, our clients have sought and will continue to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers' debit cards. \n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we began implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act to some extent by making pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. For fiscal 2012, the overall net impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, including restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, was a decrease of approximately $0.15 in diluted earnings per class A common share. \n\nOur broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to electronic currency may help buffer the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Dodd-Frank Act and mitigate some of its negative impacts. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment. \n\nNotice of Proposed Adjustment. &#32;On May 23, 2012, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) to our fiscal 2008 U.S. federal income tax return seeking to disallow the \n\ndeduction of settlement payments associated with the American Express litigation made during that fiscal year. However, on August 15, 2012, the IRS issued a Chief Counsel Advice (CCA), supporting our position that Visa is entitled to the deduction, and subsequently the IRS issued a revised Revenue Agent Report (RAR) effectively withdrawing the NOPA. The IRS may still challenge any income tax return position taken, including the deductibility of covered litigation payments made in fiscal 2008 or any future year, until the statute of limitations has closed for each applicable year. The statute of limitations for fiscal 2008 is expected to expire in June of 2013. However, given the CCA and revised RAR, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by $627 million. The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years. \n\nMultidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL) . On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange MDL. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the MDL for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. The settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval, which we cannot assure will be received, and to the adjudication of any appeals. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nAdjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they either are non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nReversal of tax reserves. &#32;During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by $627 million. The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLitigation provision. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion &#32;and related tax benefits associated with the interchange MDL, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeferred tax adjustment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevaluation of Visa Europe put option. &#32;During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating other income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision. The reduction in the fair value of the put option was the result of declines in our estimated long-term price-to-earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and did not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. \n\n##TABLE_END The following table presents our adjusted financial results for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except margin ratio and per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Visa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Visa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (2) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n8,282 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.16 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,650 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.16 \n\nReversal of tax reserves \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(326 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.48 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLitigation provision \n\n(4,098 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,593 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.82 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nImpact of deferred tax adjustment \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(208 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.31 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nRevaluation of Visa Europe put option \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(122 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.17 \n\n) \n\nAdjusted \n\n$ \n\n4,184 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,203 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6.20 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.99 \n\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding (as reported) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nOperating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total operating revenues. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. \n\n##TABLE_END Reduction in as-converted shares. &#32;During fiscal 2012 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million shares, using $2.4 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion, $710 million &#32;was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we made deposits totaling $1.7 billion &#32; of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. \n\nIn July 2012 , our board of directors authorized a $1 billion &#32;share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013 . As of September 30, 2012, the program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million . In October 2012 , our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion &#32;share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013 . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed. \n\nNominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and processed transactions are the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume increased as a result of continuing double-digit percentage growth in consumer credit and commercial payments volume worldwide. These increases were moderated by an anticipated deceleration in consumer debit growth, primarily due to the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Excluding U.S. debit transactions, which reflect the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate, reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency. \n\nThe following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars (1) . \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nRest of World &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVisa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2012 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2011 (2) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nChange &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2012 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2011 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nChange &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2012 (2) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2011 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nChange &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in billions, except percentages) \n\nNominal Payments Volume \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer credit \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,370 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,081 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,829 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nConsumer debit (3) \n\n1,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,037 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,378 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,302 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCommercial and other (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal Nominal Payments Volume \n\n$ \n\n2,066 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,961 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,833 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,569 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,899 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,530 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCash volume \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,921 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,704 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,351 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal Nominal Volume (4) \n\n$ \n\n2,496 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,364 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,753 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nRest of World \n\n&#160; \n\nVisa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2011 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2010 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nChange &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2011 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2010 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nChange &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2011 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n12 months \n\nended \n\nJune 30, \n\n2010 (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nChange &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in billions, except percentages) \n\nNominal Payments Volume \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer credit \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,829 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,586 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nConsumer debit (3) \n\n1,037 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,302 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,107 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCommercial and other (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal Nominal Payments Volume \n\n$ \n\n1,961 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,752 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,569 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,285 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,530 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,037 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCash volume \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,704 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,785 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal Nominal Volume (4) \n\n$ \n\n2,364 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,125 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,696 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,821 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining the interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance by the issuing bank, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. \n\nThe following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: \n\nService revenues &#32;consist primarily of revenues earned for providing clients with a supported global business infrastructure and for services which support the various product platforms that enable clients to deliver Visa products and payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. \n\nData processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway and PlaySpan's virtual goods payment platform . Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. \n\nInternational transaction revenues &#32;are earned for processing cross-border transactions, and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the cardholder's issuer country is different from the merchant's country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments and cash volume. \n\nOther revenues &#32;consist primarily of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and certain activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. &#32; \n\nClient incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nPersonnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. \n\nNetwork and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. \n\nMarketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. \n\nProfessional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. \n\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. \n\nGeneral and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. \n\nLitigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. \n\nOther Income (Expense) \n\nInterest income (expense) primarily includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. \n\nInvestment income &#32;represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other investments. \n\nOther non-operating income primarily relates to gains and losses earned on equity method investments and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. \n\nVisa Inc. Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nThe following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services.

Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the U.S. during fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect low double-digit percentage growth in our operating revenues for the full 2013 fiscal year. \n\nOur operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. There was no significant impact on the year-over-year growth for fiscal 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , as the effect of exchange rate movements was substantially mitigated through our \n\nhedging program. We expect the impacts of our hedging program to continue to minimize the effect of exchange rate movements during fiscal 2013 .

Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nService revenues increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;primarily due to 10% &#32;growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in geography-specific pricing. Service revenues &#32; increased in fiscal 2011 &#32;primarily due to 16% &#32;growth in nominal payments volume combined with benefits from competitive pricing actions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nData processing revenues &#32;increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;primarily as a result of the implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act to some extent through pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. This price restructuring included the implementation of the Fixed Acquirer Network Fee, which was partially offset by reductions in certain variable fees. While data processing fees benefited from the price restructuring that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 , increased merchant and acquirer incentives executed as part of this strategy resulted in higher client incentive levels, which partially offset this increase. \n\n##TABLE_END Data processing revenues for fiscal 2012 &#32;also benefited from overall growth in processed transactions of 5% , which reflected an anticipated decline in U.S. debit transactions processed as a result of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act becoming effective the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The deceleration in processed transaction growth was led by Interlink, one of our lowest yielding products in the U.S., which decreased 51% in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the same prior year period. This negative impact was more than offset by solid growth in CyberSource billable transactions, Visa transactions processed outside of the U.S., U.S. credit transactions and Visa Debit transactions, which exclude Interlink. \n\nData processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 &#32;primarily due to 12% &#32;growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource. This growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts and a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions on a net basis instead of a gross basis. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInternational transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;primarily reflecting 11% and 18% growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther revenues &#32;increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;primarily due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth. Other revenues &#32; decreased in fiscal 2011 &#32;primarily due to a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the Visa Extras rewards program on a net basis instead of a gross basis, and as a result of a large issuer that converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The decrease was partially offset by increases in license fees and the inclusion of revenue from our acquired entities. \n\n##TABLE_END 40 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nClient incentives &#32;increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2012 , including a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. Client incentives also increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume and certain one-time incentives incurred outside the U.S. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% for the full 2013 fiscal year. \n\n##TABLE_END Increases in client incentives during fiscal 2011 &#32;reflected growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011 . \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nPersonnel \n\n$ \n\n1,726 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,459 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,222 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nNetwork and processing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(68 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n)% \n\nMarketing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(94 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n)% \n\nProfessional fees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nLitigation provision \n\n4,100 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(45 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n4,093 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\nTotal Operating Expenses (2) \n\n$ \n\n8,282 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,550 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The increase also reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2011 &#32;primarily reflects the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. The increases in headcount reflect our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly outside the U.S., in support of our core business, as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNetwork and processing &#32;increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;primarily due to higher fees paid for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes. \n\n##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2011 &#32;reflects the change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions on a net basis instead of on a gross basis. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMarketing remained flat in fiscal 2012 &#32;despite an increase in spending to support new product initiatives and our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2013, including incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies and new product initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END The decrease in fiscal 2011 &#32;primarily reflects a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the Visa Extras rewards program on a net basis instead of on a gross basis, combined with the \n\nimpact of a large issuer converting away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProfessional fees increased in fiscal 2012 &#32;and 2011 , primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects to support our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDepreciation and amortization &#32;increased in fiscal 2012 , primarily due to additional depreciation expense from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2011 &#32;primarily reflects the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5&#8212;Acquisitions &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGeneral and administrative increased primarily due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary asset and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies. \n\n##TABLE_END The increase in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLitigation provision in fiscal 2012 &#32;reflects a $4.1 billion &#32;accrual related to litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. The credit to the provision in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $41 million &#32;pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers&#8217; litigation settlement, combined with the release of accruals for certain other legal matters settled during fiscal 2010. See Note 2&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END Other Income (Expense) \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nInterest income (expense) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(72 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n&#160; \n\n(55 \n\n)% \n\nInvestment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(72 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(67 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(121 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(98 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTotal Other Income (Expense) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(132 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(66 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Interest expense in fiscal 2011 reflects lower interest accretion due to declining litigation balances as well as the reversal of previously accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. See Note 20&#8212;Income Taxes &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInvestment income includes pre-tax gains of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Solu&#231;&#245;es e Servi&#231;os, or CBSS, and $20 million \n\n##TABLE_END 42 \n\nrecognized in fiscal 2010 related to our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther &#32;non-operating income primarily reflects non-cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2&#8212;Visa Europe &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END Effective Income Tax Rate \n\nThe effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 is lower than the effective income tax rate of 36% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, primarily due to the impact of the following in fiscal 2012: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nthe reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\na decrease in our overall state tax rate due to changes in the California apportionment rules and the associated one-time, non-cash benefit of $208 million from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the $11 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our 2007 reorganization; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\na one-time benefit recognized upon initial recognition of foreign tax credits; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nthe effect of applying the foregoing adjustments to a pre-tax income that was reduced by a $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nthe absence of nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option. \n\n##TABLE_END We expect our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate to increase to a more normalized range of 30% to 32%. \n\nAdjusted effective income tax rate. &#32;Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except for percentages) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n2,207 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nReversal of tax reserves \n\n(43 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLitigation provision \n\n4,098 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,505 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRemeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAdjusted \n\n$ \n\n6,262 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,061 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nManagement of Our Liquidity \n\nWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. \n\nThe objectives of our treasury policies are to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprovide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nensure payments on required litigation settlements; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nmake planned capital investments in our business; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\npay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and \n\n##TABLE_END 43 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\noptimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. \n\nCash Flow Data \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nTotal cash provided by (used in): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n$ \n\n5,009 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,872 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,691 \n\nInvesting activities \n\n(2,414 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,299 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,904 \n\n) \n\nFinancing activities \n\n(2,655 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,304 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,542 \n\n) \n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,740 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(750 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 &#32;compared to prior year, primarily reflecting higher operating revenue in fiscal 2012 . We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 &#32;compared to fiscal 2010 , primarily reflecting continued growth in our net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailers' litigation obligation in fiscal 2010. \n\nInvesting activities. &#32;Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 &#32;and fiscal 2011 was relatively consistent, reflecting our continued investment in available-for-sale securities. See Note 4&#8212;Fair Value Measurements and Investments &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. Comparatively, cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 primarily included $1.8 billion &#32;for the acquisition of CyberSource. \n\nFinancing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as-converted class A share count, either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow, and increased dividends. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 15&#8212;Stockholders' Equity &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nSources of Liquidity \n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. \n\nFunds held by our foreign subsidiaries include cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, both short and long-term. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of $2.6 billion , which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. \n\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.3 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. \n\nFactors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, \n\nand the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors. \n\nRevolving credit facilities. In February 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. We are in the process of replacing this facility in fiscal 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2012 . \n\nU.S. commercial paper program . We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2012 . There are no financial covenants related to this program. \n\nUniversal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires in July 2015. \n\nLitigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2012 , was $4.4 billion &#32;and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nAt September 30, 2012 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nStandard and Poor&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s \n\nDebt type \n\nRating \n\n&#160; \n\nOutlook \n\n&#160; \n\nRating \n\n&#160; \n\nOutlook \n\nShort-term unsecured debt \n\nA-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n&#160; \n\nP-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\nLong-term unsecured debt \n\nA+ \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n&#160; \n\nA1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. \n\nUses of Liquidity \n\nPayments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2012, we often did not need to fund settlement working capital as indicated by the fact that our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $43 million, although our greatest working capital requirement was a peak net settlement receivable balance of $587 million. \n\nCovered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2012 , we made $140 million &#32;in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2012 &#32;the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $4.4 billion . In October 2012, we made an additional payment of $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32; and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOther litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. \n\nReduction in as-converted shares. &#32;During fiscal 2012 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million &#32;shares, using $2.4 billion &#32;of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion , $710 million &#32;was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we made deposits totaling $1.7 billion &#32; of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. \n\nIn July 2012, our board of directors authorized a $1 billion &#32;share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013 . At September 30, 2012 , this share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million . In October 2012 , our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion &#32;share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013 . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed. See Note 15&#8212;Stockholders' Equity &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nDividends . During fiscal 2012 , we paid $595 million &#32;in dividends. On October 24, 2012 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.33 &#32;per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $221 million &#32;in connection with this dividend in December 2012. See Note 15&#8212;Stockholders' Equity &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. \n\nVisa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the \"P/E ratio\" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the \"adjusted sustainable income\" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. \n\nAt September 30, 2012 , we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million . While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each \n\ncase, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. \n\nGiven the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2012 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2012 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9 x. At September 30, 2012 , the spot P/E ratio was 18.8 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.8 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nVisa Inc&#8217;s Forward \n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio \n\n&#160; \n\nPayout Assuming \n\nAdjusted Sustainable \n\nIncome of $100 million (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/Decrease in Payout \n\nfor Each $25 million of \n\nAdjusted Sustainable \n\nIncome Above/Below $100 million \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$625 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n$500 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$375 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nGiven the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. \n\n##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $88 million , $74 million , and $66 million , respectively. In fiscal 2013 , we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $52 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. \n\nCapital expenditures. &#32;Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2012 &#32;due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $425 million &#32;to $475 million &#32;range in fiscal 2013 , as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. \n\nAcquisitions. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2012 , compared to fiscal 2011 , when we acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received. See Note 5&#8212;Acquisitions &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. \n\nFair Value Measurements&#8212;Financial Instruments \n\nThe assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair \n\nvalue. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2012 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $9.8 billion &#32;of assets and $168 million &#32;of liabilities. Of these instruments, $164 million , or less than 2%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million &#32;of this amount. At September 30, 2012 , debt instruments in this category included $7 million &#32;of auction rate securities. See Note 4&#8212;Fair Value Measurements and Investments &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. \n\nIndemnifications \n\nWe indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, traveler's cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See &#32; Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32; and &#32; Note 12&#8212;Settlement Guarantee Management &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2012. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities, or the litigation escrow account. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than \n\n1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1-3 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\n3-5 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than \n\n5 Years \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nPurchase orders (1) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,043 \n\nLeases (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nClient incentives (3) \n\n2,537 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,025 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,653 \n\nMarketing and sponsorship (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLitigation settlement payments (5) \n\n4,383 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,383 \n\nDividends (6) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal (7,8,9) \n\n$ \n\n8,209 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,017 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,251 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,354 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nRepresents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nIncludes both operating and capital leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nRepresents future cash payments for incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies &#32;to our consolidated financial statements \n\n##TABLE_END 48 \n\nrepresent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements which we estimate we will record. \n\n##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nVisa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) &#160; \n\nVisa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings on October 19, 2012. The amount in the table represents the maximum amount expected to be paid out in fiscal 2013 under the class plaintiffs' settlement agreement and the individual plaintiffs' settlement agreement from the litigation escrow account. This amount includes the $350 million &#32;payment to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund made in October 2012. A litigation provision of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation was booked during fiscal 2012. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) &#160; \n\nIncludes expected dividend amount of $221 million &#32;as dividends were declared on October 24, 2012 &#32;and will be paid on December 4, 2012 &#32;to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 16, 2012 . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) &#160; \n\nWe have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $139 million. At September 30, 2012, we also accrued $20 million &#32;of interest and $7 million &#32;of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8) &#160; \n\nVisa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million &#32;at September 30, 2012 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity &#32;and Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;and Note 2&#8212;Visa Europe &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (9) &#160; \n\nWe evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11&#8212;Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits &#32; to our consolidated financial statements . \n\n##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. \n\nWe believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. \n\nRevenue Recognition &#8212; Client Incentives \n\nCritical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. \n\nThe capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts \n\nAssumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. \n\nImpact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2012 , client incentives represented 17% &#32;of gross operating revenues. \n\nFair Value &#8212; Visa Europe Put Option \n\nCritical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. \n\nUpon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2&#8212;Visa Europe &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. \n\nThe fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million &#32;at September 30, 2012 . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. \n\nWhile this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;for further discussion. \n\nAssumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. \n\nProbability of Exercise&#8212; Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: \n\n(i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. \n\nP/E Differential&#8212; The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the &#8220;long-term P/E calculation&#8221;) and the last 30 trading dates (the &#8220;30-day P/E calculation&#8221;) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. \n\nFactors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. \n\nOther estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. \n\nImpact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012 , we have assumed a 40% &#32;probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% &#32;higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million &#32;in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million &#32;in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Matters \n\nCritical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. \n\nAssumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability \n\nand whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. \n\nOur retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We recorded an additional accrual of $4.1 billion &#32;for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nImpact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nCritical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. \n\nAssumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. \n\nImpact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 127, "Negative": 224, "Polarity": -0.2763532755659451, "Subjectivity": 0.05514532599290725}, "similarity_score": 0.902747987341717, "nlp_result": 0.01641760522362876}
