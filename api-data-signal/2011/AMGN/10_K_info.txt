MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END Forward-looking statements \n\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management&#146;s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;outlook,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;seek,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;assume&#148; and &#147;continue,&#148; as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management&#146;s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends and stock repurchases. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. \n\nOverview \n\nThe following management&#146;s discussion and analysis (MD&#38;A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen&#146;s business. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&#38;A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). \n\nWe are the world&#146;s largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment &#151; human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. \n\nWe earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, inflammation and nephrology. Our principal products include Neulasta &#174; , NEUPOGEN &#174; , ENBREL, Aranesp &#174; and EPOGEN &#174; . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business &#151; Marketed Products. \n\nIn 2011, we had several notable accomplishments, including achieving record U.S. and international product sales of $11.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. We also paid our first ever dividends, aggregating $500 million paid in 2011. In December 2011, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock payable in March 2012, representing a 29% increase over prior quarters. Additionally, in 2011, we repurchased approximately 15% of our stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010, for a total cost of $8.3 billion. Of this amount, $5 billion was purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer following an increase in our authorized stock repurchase program to $10 billion and our announcement that we intended to accelerate our repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. We issued $7.5 billion of debt, in part to fund the purchase of stock related to the tender offer. We expect to repurchase the remaining $5 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. \n\nWe enter 2012 with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA &#174; and Prolia &#174; represent significant commercial opportunities. In addition, receiving regulatory and/or reimbursement approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications \n\n&#160; \n\nfor these products may provide further opportunities for growth. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and Japan, by the successful development of our later stage pipeline and through strategic business development opportunities, such as our acquisitions of BioVex, Bergamo and our recently announced agreement to acquire Micromet. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies, along with the significant savings that we will realize upon the expiration of our ENBREL co-promotion agreement with Pfizer in the fourth quarter of 2013, may assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. \n\nOur business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure, including in Europe as a result of biosimilars. In the United States, ENBREL will also continue to face increasing competition and our ESAs may begin facing competition in the near term. Additionally, over the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire and, as a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. We also believe our products and product candidates will continue to face regulatory and reimbursement challenges. In addition, the current global economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including increased pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. \n\nCertain of the above challenges may have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and liquidity. However, these effects may be offset by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business, as discussed above. \n\nSelected financial information \n\nThe following provides an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition (amounts in millions, except percentages and per-share data): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Product sales: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. \n\n&#160; $ 11,725 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; $ 11,254 &#160; International \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,570 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,406 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total product sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 15,295 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 14,660 &#160; Other revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 287 &#160; &#160; &#160; (27)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 393 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; $ 15,582 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; $ 15,053 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; $ 11,270 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; &#160; $ 9,508 &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 4,312 &#160; &#160; &#160; (22)% &#160; &#160; $ 5,545 &#160; Net income \n\n&#160; $ 3,683 &#160; &#160; &#160; (20)% &#160; &#160; $ 4,627 &#160; Diluted EPS \n\n&#160; $ 4.04 &#160; &#160; &#160; (16)% &#160; &#160; $ 4.79 &#160; Diluted shares \n\n&#160; &#160; 912 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 965 &#160; ##TABLE_END When discussing changes in product sales below, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. \n\nThe increase in U.S. product sales for 2011 reflects overall growth for all marketed products except ESAs, which declined 17%. Excluding sales of ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 14%, driven primarily by unit growth and, to a lesser extent, increases in average net sales prices. International product sales for 2011 were negatively impacted by a decline in sales of Aranesp &#174; of 5%. Excluding Aranesp &#174; sales, international product sales grew 11%. \n\nThe decrease in other revenues for 2011 was due principally to certain milestone payments earned in 2010. \n\nThe increase in operating expenses for 2011 was driven primarily by a legal settlement charge and higher SG&#38;A expenses. \n\nThe decrease in diluted EPS for 2011 was due to the reduction in net income, attributable primarily to lower operating income. This decrease in diluted EPS was offset partially by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. \n\n&#160; \n\nAlthough changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the euro. \n\nOur results of operations for 2011 were impacted by the Puerto Rico excise tax. Commencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. This tax is currently scheduled to expire in 2016. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax, for 2011 cost of sales increased by $211 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $321 million and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.12. \n\nAs of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $20.6 billion, and total debt outstanding was $21.4 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nProduct sales \n\nWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a reduction in demand and/or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period, which we believe to be due, in part, to certain of these factors. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. \n\nIn addition, general economic conditions may affect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. \n\nSee Item 1.

Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.5% of product sales compared with 15.1% for 2010. This decrease was driven by improved productivity, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies. \n\nCost of sales increased to 15.1% of product sales for 2010, driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write-offs due to voluntary EPOGEN &#174; , PROCRIT &#174; (epoetin alfa) and ENBREL recalls. These increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties, primarily for ENBREL. \n\nResearch and development \n\nR&#38;D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems&#146; costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&#38;D with alternative future uses. R&#38;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&#38;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&#38;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. \n\nThe Company groups all of its R&#38;D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company&#146;s R&#38;D activities as set forth in the following table: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Category \n\n&#160; Description \n\nDiscovery Research and Translational Sciences \n\n&#160; R&#38;D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs \n\n&#160; R&#38;D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products \n\n&#160; R&#38;D expenses incurred in support of the Company&#146;s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nR&#38;D expense by category was as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; Discovery Research and Translational Sciences \n\n&#160; $ 1,125 &#160; &#160; $ 1,154 &#160; &#160; $ 1,157 &#160; Later stage clinical programs \n\n&#160; &#160; 983 &#160; &#160; &#160; 832 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; Marketed products \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,059 &#160; &#160; &#160; 908 &#160; &#160; &#160; 707 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total R&#38;D expense. \n\n&#160; $ 3,167 &#160; &#160; $ 2,894 &#160; &#160; $ 2,864 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END The increase in R&#38;D expense for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase of $151 million in our marketed product support largely driven by our continued support for Prolia &#174; and XGEVA &#174; which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs; and an increase of $151 million in our later stage clinical program support, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, offset partially by decreased support for Prolia &#174; and XGEVA &#174; as a result of their aforementioned approvals. These increases were offset partially by a decrease of $29 million in our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to R&#38;D technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years. \n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2010 was driven primarily by an increase of $201 million in our marketed product support largely driven by our support for Prolia &#174; and XGEVA &#174; which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs and, to a lesser extent, lower cost recoveries from ongoing collaborations. This increase was offset by a reduction of $168 million in our later stage clinical programs as a result of the aforementioned approvals of Prolia &#174; and XGEVA &#174; , as well as licensing fees paid in 2009, and lower expenses associated with our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities of $3 million. \n\nCertain amounts for 2010 have been reclassified to better conform to the above descriptions of R&#38;D activities. \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\nSG&#38;A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&#38;A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&#38;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. Beginning January 1, 2011, SG&#38;A expenses also include the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2011 was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee of $151 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $104 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia &#174; and XGEVA &#174; and expansion of our international operations of $89 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $67 million. \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2010 was due primarily to higher promotional costs for Prolia &#174; and other marketed products of $148 million, higher staff-related costs of $46 million and higher litigation expenses of $45 million, offset partially by charges of $29 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $1,288 million, $1,184 million and $1,163 million, respectively. \n\nOther \n\nIn 2011, we recorded a $780 million legal settlement charge in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices. In addition in 2011, as part of our continuing efforts to improve cost efficiencies in our operations, we recorded certain charges, primarily severance related, of $109 million. In 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our continuing efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. In 2009, we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. \n\nSee Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our 2011 legal settlement. \n\nNon-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes \n\nNon-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; Interest expense, net \n\n&#160; $ 610 &#160; &#160; $ 604 &#160; &#160; $ 578 &#160; Interest and other income, net \n\n&#160; $ 448 &#160; &#160; $ 376 &#160; &#160; $ 276 &#160; Provisions for income taxes \n\n&#160; $ 467 &#160; &#160; $ 690 &#160; &#160; $ 599 &#160; Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 11.3 % &#160; &#160; 13.0 % &#160; &#160; 11.5 % ##TABLE_END Interest expense, net \n\nIncluded in interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $143 million, $266 million and $250 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009. The reduction of non-cash interest expense in 2011 was offset by increased interest expense associated with recent borrowings. \n\nInterest and other income, net \n\nThe increase in interest and other income, net, for 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $67 million. \n\nThe increase in interest and other income, net, for 2010 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $48 million and higher interest income of $51 million, due principally to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011 was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in 2011, the non-deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in 2011 and the favorable resolution in 2010 of certain prior years&#146; non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities. \n\nCommencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed over a six year period beginning in 2011 with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015, and 1% in 2016). We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. The effective tax rate for 2011 would have been approximately 18% without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2010 was due primarily to the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years&#146; matters with tax authorities in 2009 compared to 2010; the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in 2010; and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years&#146; tax matters recognized in 2010 and 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively. \n\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. \n\nSee Summary of Critical Accounting Policies &#151; Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nRecent accounting pronouncements \n\nIn June 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that changed the disclosure requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the financial statements, including the elimination of the option to present OCI in the statement of stockholders&#146; equity. OCI and its components will be required to be presented for both interim and annual periods either in a single financial statement, the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of a statement of income followed by a separate statement presenting OCI. This standard is required to be applied retrospectively beginning January 1, 2012, except for certain provisions for which adoption was delayed. \n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSelected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; $ 20,641 &#160; &#160; $ 17,422 &#160; Total assets \n\n&#160; &#160; 48,871 &#160; &#160; &#160; 43,486 &#160; Current portion of long-term debt \n\n&#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,488 &#160; Long-term debt \n\n&#160; &#160; 21,344 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,874 &#160; Stockholders&#146; equity \n\n&#160; &#160; 19,029 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23,944 &#160; ##TABLE_END The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, as well as market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). In April 2011, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock. Subsequently in October 2011, the Board of Directors increased the total authorization for stock repurchases by $6.1 billion to $10 billion. At that time, we announced our intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program, reflecting our confidence in the long-term value of the Company and the attractive interest rate environment. During 2011, we repurchased 144 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer. We expect to repurchase the remaining $5 billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open-market purchases. In April 2011, the Board of Directors also approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock in July and October 2011, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $500 million in 2011. Additionally in December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 per share of common stock, payable in March 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as &#147;U.S. funds&#148;) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. \n\nA significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent upon the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, customers outside the United States, which include government owned or supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent, in part, upon the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, may continue to increase the average length of time it takes to collect payments, particularly in certain regions within these countries. However, the timing of payments from government healthcare providers has not nor is it expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows. To date we have not incurred any significant losses on collections of trade receivables from these government healthcare providers. \n\nOver the next several years, many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. Upon patent expiration for small molecule products, there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers, which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product. Given that our principal products are biologics, we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products, in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics, including significant regulatory, clinical and manufacturing expertise, and since the products are similar, but not identical, the biosimilars will have to compete against a product with an established efficacy and safety record. As discussed above, we have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA &#174; and Prolia &#174; and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products&#146; patent expiries. \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\nOf our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2011, approximately $16.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. \n\nThe primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. \n\nFinancing arrangements \n\nThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2011, were $84 million and $21.3 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2010, were $2.5 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2011, including: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; In 2011, we issued $10.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 1.875% 2014 Notes, the 2.30% 2016 Notes, the 2.50% 2016 Notes, the 4.375% 2018 euro Notes (&#128;550 million aggregate principal amount), the 4.10% 2021 Notes, the 3.875% 2021 Notes, the 5.50% 2026 pound sterling Notes (&#163;475 million aggregate principal amount), the 5.15% 2041 Notes and the 5.65% 2042 Notes. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; In 2010, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 4.50% 2020 Notes, the 3.45% 2020 Notes, the 5.75% 2040 Notes and the 4.95% 2041 Notes. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of the 5.70% 2019 Notes and the 6.40% 2039 Notes. \n\n##TABLE_END In February 2011, our 0.125% 2011 Convertible Notes became due, and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. No debt was due or repaid in 2010, and we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% in 2009. \n\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. \n\nIn order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long-term notes issued in 2011, we entered into cross currency swap contracts. These cross currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest payments in pounds sterling at a fixed rate of 5.5% on &#163;475 million and pay interest in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5.8% on $748 million, the aggregate notional amounts paid to/received from the counterparties upon exchange of currencies at the inception of these contracts. We will pay U.S. dollars to and receive pounds sterling from the counterparties at the maturity of the contracts for the same notional amounts. The terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged notes, effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on these notes from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. \n\nAs of December 31, 2011, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. \n\nIn December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. We would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In connection with the new revolving credit agreement we terminated our prior $2.3 billion revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in November 2012. \n\nIn March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in April 2011. This shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. \n\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2011. \n\nSee Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. \n\nCash flows \n\nOur cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; Net cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; $ 5,119 &#160; &#160; $ 5,787 &#160; &#160; $ 6,336 &#160; Net cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; (786 ) &#160; &#160; (4,152 ) &#160; &#160; (3,202 ) Net cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; (674 ) &#160; &#160; (1,232 ) &#160; &#160; (2,024 ) ##TABLE_END Operating \n\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during the 2011 due primarily to: increased interest payments; working capital increases related to the launch of Prolia &#174; and XGEVA &#174; ; and the prepayment of certain royalties. The reduction in net income during 2011 was driven primarily by the accrual of the legal settlement charge of $780 million, which will be paid in a subsequent period. Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities. \n\nInvesting \n\nCapital expenditures totaled $567 million, $580 million and $530 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. We currently estimate 2012 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. \n\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses totaling $701 million. \n\nNet proceeds from marketable securities were $437 million for 2011, compared to net purchases of marketable securities of $3.5 billion for 2010 and $2.7 billion for 2009. \n\nFinancing \n\nCash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2011; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion, including $7.5 billion issued in November and December 2011, in part, to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified Dutch auction tender offer. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.8 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2009 was due to repurchases of our common stock of $3.2 billion and repayment of long-term debt of $1.0 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders&#146; equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. \n\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, aggregated by type (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Payments due by period &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Year &#160; &#160; Years &#160; &#160; Years &#160; &#160; Years &#160; Contractual obligations \n\n&#160; Total &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 2 and 3 &#160; &#160; 4 and 5 &#160; &#160; 6 and beyond &#160; Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) \n\n&#160; $ 37,521 &#160; &#160; $ 888 &#160; &#160; $ 6,131 &#160; &#160; $ 3,396 &#160; &#160; $ 27,106 &#160; Operating lease obligations \n\n&#160; &#160; 774 &#160; &#160; &#160; 116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 189 &#160; &#160; &#160; 141 &#160; &#160; &#160; 328 &#160; Purchase obligations (4) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,992 &#160; &#160; &#160; 865 &#160; &#160; &#160; 420 &#160; &#160; &#160; 243 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,464 &#160; Unrecognized tax benefits (5) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total contractual obligations \n\n&#160; $ 41,287 &#160; &#160; $ 1,869 &#160; &#160; $ 6,740 &#160; &#160; $ 3,780 &#160; &#160; $ 28,898 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts also include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2011, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net reduction in future interest payments of $366 million. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long-term debt issued in December 2011, we entered into cross currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest and principal payments and on this debt. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross currency swap contracts. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) The long-term debt obligations amounts include the repayment of principal on our euro denominated foreign currency debt at the foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2011. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (4) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&#38;D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (5) &#160; Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $912 million at December 31, 2011, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the BioVex contingent consideration, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2011, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.6 billion, including $575 million in connection with the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nProduct sales, sales deductions and returns \n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, &#147;sales deductions&#148;) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. \n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Rebates &#160; &#160; Chargebacks &#160; &#160; Other deductions &#160; &#160; Total &#160; Balance as of January 1, 2009 \n\n&#160; $ 653 &#160; &#160; $ 84 &#160; &#160; $ 139 &#160; &#160; $ 876 &#160; Amounts charged against product sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,663 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,424 &#160; &#160; &#160; 552 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,639 &#160; Payments \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,609 ) &#160; &#160; (2,380 ) &#160; &#160; (556 ) &#160; &#160; (4,545 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Balance as of December 31, 2009 \n\n&#160; &#160; 707 &#160; &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; &#160; 135 &#160; &#160; &#160; 970 &#160; Amounts charged against product sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,861 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,593 &#160; &#160; &#160; 580 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,034 &#160; Payments \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,724 ) &#160; &#160; (2,548 ) &#160; &#160; (588 ) &#160; &#160; (4,860 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Balance as of December 31, 2010 \n\n&#160; &#160; 844 &#160; &#160; &#160; 173 &#160; &#160; &#160; 127 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,144 &#160; Amounts charged against product sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,795 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,626 &#160; &#160; &#160; 670 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,091 &#160; Payments \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,592 ) &#160; &#160; (2,600 ) &#160; &#160; (717 ) &#160; &#160; (4,909 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Balance as of December 31, 2011 \n\n&#160; $ 1,047 &#160; &#160; $ 199 &#160; &#160; $ 80 &#160; &#160; $ 1,326 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total sales deductions were 25%, 25% and 24% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 2% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for the three year ended December 31, 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. \n\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. \n\nRebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which for certain rebates can take up to one year and greater than one year for certain recent government programs. Rebates totaled $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011. A 5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2011 would have had an impact of approximately $90 million, or approximately one-half of 1% of our 2011 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. \n\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. \n\nProduct returns \n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. \n\nCertain items are included in the Company&#146;s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. \n\nThe Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company&#146;s pre-tax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company&#146;s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company&#146;s foreign income associated with the Company&#146;s operations conducted in Puerto Rico. \n\nIf future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. \n\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.) \n\nContingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. \n\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nValuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations \n\nWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&#38;D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. \n\nWe believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 111, "Negative": 123, "Polarity": -0.05128205106289722, "Subjectivity": 0.044360189565050195}, "similarity_score": 0.846317432193239, "nlp_result": 0}
