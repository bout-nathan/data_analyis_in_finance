Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our &#147;Direct to Consumer&#148; operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives, worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and service businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, &#147;must have&#148; products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. \n\nIn addition to achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Expanding gross margin by: \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#150; &#160; Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#150; &#160; Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation, \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#150; &#160; Utilizing price increases to effectively manage the price-to-value equation for our customers. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs, \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Improving working capital efficiency, and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Deploying capital effectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; High-single-digit revenue growth, \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Mid-teens earnings per share growth, \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. \n\n##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, NIKE, Inc.&#146;s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 15% to 22% and we expanded gross margins by 4 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur fiscal 2012 results demonstrated our continued focus toward delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2012. Our revenues grew 16% to $24.1 billion, net income increased 4% to $2.2 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.73, an 8% increase from fiscal 2011. \n\nIncome before income taxes increased 5% for fiscal 2012, driven by revenue growth and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin and an increase in other expense. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies, key categories and product types. Brand strength, innovative products and strong category retail presentation continues to fuel the demand for our NIKE Brand products. During fiscal 2012, we introduced a number of innovations, including the NIKE Fuelband and the Flyknit technology. The NIKE Fuelband is a digital device that tracks one&#146;s daily activities through a sport-tested accelerometer, while Flyknit is a new footwear technology that uses advanced materials and proprietary manufacturing technology to produce a form-fitting, lightweight and seamless upper. During this time, we also expanded our NIKE + platform into our Basketball and Training categories, and launched new high performance uniforms for all 32 NFL teams. Revenue for our Other Businesses also grew, reflective of growth across most businesses, led by Converse. Our gross margin continued to be impacted by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, which more than offset the positive impacts of higher product selling prices, the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and benefits from ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, the growth of our net income was negatively affected by a year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate. However, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, driven by share repurchases during fiscal 2012 and 2011. \n\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1) sales to external wholesale customers and 2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues do not include the estimation of sales made by NIKE Brand licensees as the amounts are not material. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (4) Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 17 ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% for fiscal 2012, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15%, as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012. North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase, while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 11% during fiscal 2012, contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth. \n\nExcluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15% and 13%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16% during fiscal 2012. Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to double-digit percentage growth in unit sales along with a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, notably Running, Sportswear and Basketball. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by mid-single-digit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases, partially offset by a higher mix of close-out sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories. \n\nWhile wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to see growth in revenue through our Direct to Consumer channels. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2012, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2011. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21% for fiscal 2012, as comparable store sales grew 13% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: the store has been open at least one year, square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. \n\nRevenues for our Other Businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 11% in fiscal 2012, reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley, which was slightly down for the fiscal year. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nOn both a reported and currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 10% for fiscal 2011, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10% for fiscal 2011, while revenues for our Other Businesses increased 8%. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, every NIKE Brand geography except Japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011, led by North America, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase. The Emerging Markets and Greater China contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. \n\nBy product group, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues declined 2% during fiscal 2011. Fueling the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and Free technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low single-digit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Men&#146;s Training, Action Sports and Women&#146;s Training products, while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products and fewer close-outs as a percentage of total sales. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines, while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat. The increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 16% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 15% in fiscal 2010. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network, increase comparable store sales and build our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales grew 11% for fiscal 2011. \n\nExcluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for Other Businesses increased by 8% in fiscal 2011, reflecting double-digit percentage revenue growth at Converse, Cole Haan and Hurley, and a low-single-digit growth at Umbro, which more than offset a mid-single-digit revenue decline at NIKE Golf. \n\nFutures Orders \n\nFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2012 were 7% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, as unit orders and average selling price per unit each contributed approximately 6 percentage points of growth. \n\n&#160;\n\nBy geography, futures orders growth was as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Reported Futures Orders Growth &#160; &#160; Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes (1) &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 15 % Western Europe &#160; &#160; -2 % &#160; &#160; 8 % Central &#38; Eastern Europe &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 11 % Greater China &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 2 % Japan &#160; &#160; -6 % &#160; &#160; 1 % Emerging Markets &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; 20 % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 12 % ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. \n\n&#160;\n\nGross Margin \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; Gross Profit \n\n&#160; $ 10,471 &#160; &#160; $ 9,508 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; $ 8,800 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % Gross Margin % \n\n&#160; &#160; 43.4 % &#160; &#160; 45.6 % &#160; &#160; (220 ) bps &#160; &#160; 46.3 % &#160; &#160; (70 ) bps ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, across most businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges, discounts on close-out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points. Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases, lower air freight costs, the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nFor fiscal 2011, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by higher input costs, transportation costs, including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for NIKE Brand products across most businesses, and a lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of NIKE, Inc. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011, with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives. \n\n&#160;\n\nSelling and Administrative Expense \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; Demand creation expense (1) \n\n&#160; $ 2,711 &#160; &#160; $ 2,448 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; $ 2,356 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % Operating overhead expense \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,720 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,245 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; 3,970 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % Selling and administrative expense \n\n&#160; $ 7,431 &#160; &#160; $ 6,693 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; $ 6,326 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % % of Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 30.8 % &#160; &#160; 32.1 % &#160; &#160; (130 ) bps &#160; &#160; 33.3 % &#160; &#160; (120 ) bps ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nOverall, selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012. \n\nDemand creation expense increased 11% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL uniforms, as well as an increased level of brand event spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point. \n\nCompared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 11%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nIn fiscal 2011, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense. \n\nDemand creation expense increased 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers. \n\nOperating overhead expense increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations, where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year. \n\n&#160;\n\nOther Expense (Income), net \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; Other expense (income), net &#160; $ 54 &#160; &#160; $ (33 ) &#160; $ (49 ) ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 19 ##TABLE_END Other expense (income), net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, other expense, net increased $87 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $76 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year. These impacts, together with a $24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brand&#146;s Western Europe operations, were partially offset by certain net gains related to non-operating items. \n\nThe combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense (income), net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nFor fiscal 2011, other expense (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, we estimated that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million on our income before income taxes. \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 25.5 % &#160; &#160; 25.0 % &#160; &#160; 50 bps &#160; &#160; &#160; 24.2 % &#160; &#160; 80 bps &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 50 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax position. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 primarily due to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions. \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Segments \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#146;s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central &#38; Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. \n\nAs part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity&#146;s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. \n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2012 presentation. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe breakdown of revenues follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 (1) &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 \n\n% Change \n\nExcluding \n\nCurrency Changes (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 (1) &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 \n\n% Change \n\nExcluding \n\nCurrency Changes (2) \n\n&#160; North America &#160; $ 8,839 &#160; &#160; $ 7,579 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; $ 6,697 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; 13 % Western Europe &#160; &#160; 4,144 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,868 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; 3,839 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 6 % Central &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,200 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,040 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 999 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; 6 % Greater China &#160; &#160; 2,539 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,060 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23 % &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; 1,742 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; 16 % Japan \n\n&#160; &#160; 829 &#160; &#160; &#160; 766 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 882 &#160; &#160; &#160; -13 % &#160; &#160; -21 % Emerging Markets &#160; &#160; 3,410 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,736 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 % &#160; &#160; 26 % &#160; &#160; 2,198 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 19 % Global Brand Divisions \n\n&#160; &#160; 111 &#160; &#160; &#160; 96 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; 86 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; 16 % Total NIKE Brand Revenues &#160; &#160; 21,072 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,145 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 16,443 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; 10 % Other Businesses \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,095 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,786 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; 2,564 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; &#160; 8 % Corporate (3) &#160; &#160; (39 ) &#160; &#160; (69 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers, driving demand for NIKE Brand products across all seven key categories. North America&#146;s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19% for fiscal 2012, fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, footwear revenue in North America increased 15%, driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices. Unit sales rose at a double-digit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a mid-single-digit rate, reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Basketball, Women&#146;s Training and Sportswear. \n\nCompared to the prior year, apparel revenue for North America increased 18%, primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in unit sales. The increase in average selling price per unit was reflective of product price increases and a greater mix of higher price point products. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, including Men&#146;s Training, Running and Basketball. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, EBIT for North America increased 16% as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on close-out sales, which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases, lower air freight costs and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012, as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nRevenues for North America increased 13%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in both wholesale and Direct to Consumer revenues. Contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers, improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season products. North America&#146;s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19%, which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to North America&#146;s revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 14% growth in comparable store sales. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the increase in North America footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Men&#146;s and Women&#146;s Training and Football (Soccer) and a single-digit percentage growth in Basketball, partially offset by a low-single-digit percentage decline in sales of our NIKE Brand Sportswear products. \n\nThe year-over-year increase in North America apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in most key categories, most notably Men&#146;s Training, Running, Basketball and Women&#146;s Training. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the increase in North America&#146;s EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage. The decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs, which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and fewer close-out sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; Revenues by: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Footwear \n\n&#160; $ 2,526 &#160; &#160; $ 2,345 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; $ 2,284 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; 8 % Apparel \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,377 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,303 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 1,311 &#160; &#160; &#160; -1 % &#160; &#160; 4 % Equipment \n\n&#160; &#160; 241 &#160; &#160; &#160; 220 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 244 &#160; &#160; &#160; -10 % &#160; &#160; -5 % TOTAL REVENUES &#160; $ 4,144 &#160; &#160; $ 3,868 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; $ 3,839 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 6 % Revenues by: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sales to Wholesale Customers \n\n&#160; $ 3,556 &#160; &#160; $ 3,385 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; $ 3,380 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 % &#160; &#160; 5 % Sales Direct to Consumer \n\n&#160; &#160; 588 &#160; &#160; &#160; 483 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; 459 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 10 % TOTAL REVENUES &#160; $ 4,144 &#160; &#160; $ 3,868 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; $ 3,839 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 6 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES &#160; $ 597 &#160; &#160; $ 730 &#160; &#160; &#160; -18 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 807 &#160; &#160; &#160; -10 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 4% for fiscal 2012, as most territories reported revenue growth, which more than offset revenue declines in the U.K. &#38; Ireland and Italy. Revenues for the U.K. &#38; Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, declined 3% for the fiscal 2012 period. Western Europe&#146;s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 18% for fiscal 2012, including 8% growth in comparable store sales. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 5% for fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a low-single-digit percentage growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair, primarily reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer), which more than offset a decline in Action Sports. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2% for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a mid-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, reflective of higher product prices. Partially offsetting the increase in average selling price per unit was a mid-single-digit percentage decline in unit sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a decline in Sportswear. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 7% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 18%, primarily driven by a 350 basis point decline in gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The decline in gross margin was driven by higher product input costs and the negative impact from changes in standard currency rates, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Also reflected in Western Europe&#146;s fiscal 2012 results was a $24 million charge relating to the restructuring of its operations. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 6% for fiscal 2011, attributable to growth in most territories. Revenues for the U.K. &#38; Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, grew 5% for fiscal 2011. Western Europe&#146;s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 10%, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Western Europe&#146;s revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 6% growth in comparable store sales. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 8%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports, which more than offset a slight revenue decline in Sportswear. \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 4%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a mid-single-digit revenue decline in Sportswear. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the decrease in Western Europe&#146;s EBIT was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates. Also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs, higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts. These factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer close-out sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; Revenues by: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Footwear \n\n&#160; $ 671 &#160; &#160; $ 605 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; $ 562 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 10 % Apparel \n\n&#160; &#160; 441 &#160; &#160; &#160; 359 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23 % &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 357 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 3 % Equipment \n\n&#160; &#160; 88 &#160; &#160; &#160; 76 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; &#160; -5 % &#160; &#160; -4 % TOTAL REVENUES &#160; $ 1,200 &#160; &#160; $ 1,040 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; $ 999 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; 6 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES &#160; $ 234 &#160; &#160; $ 244 &#160; &#160; &#160; -4 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 249 &#160; &#160; &#160; -2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nExcluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Central &#38; Eastern Europe increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth across most territories, including double-digit growth in Russia and Turkey, which more than offset lower revenues in Greece. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central &#38; Eastern Europe&#146;s footwear revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair. The increase in average selling price per pair was reflective of product price increases which more than offset the negative impact of higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and Football (Soccer). \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central &#38; Eastern Europe&#146;s apparel revenues grew 24%, mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales, offset by a slight decrease in average price per unit, mainly due to less favorable product mix and higher discounts on in-line sales, which more than offset the impact from product price increases. The overall increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in Football (Soccer), Sportswear and Running. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for Central &#38; Eastern Europe increased 15% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 4%, primarily driven by a 420 basis point decline in gross margin. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher product input costs as well as higher discounts on in-line and close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact from product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat compared to the prior period. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nLed by Russia and Turkey, most territories within Central &#38; Eastern Europe reported revenue growth during fiscal 2011 as economic conditions in the geography continued to show signs of recovery. \n\nThe growth in Central &#38; Eastern Europe&#146;s footwear revenues was mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in Football (Soccer), Running and Action Sports, while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the decrease in Central &#38; Eastern Europe&#146;s EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense.

The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China&#146;s apparel revenues for fiscal 2012 was mainly driven by a high-single-digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for Greater China increased 23% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 17%, as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Gross margin decreased 150 basis points for fiscal 2012, primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, driven by an increase in operating overhead expense. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2011, driven by expansion in the number of partner-owned stores selling NIKE products, as well as improvement in comparable store sales for partner-owned stores. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the increase in Greater China&#146;s footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running and Sportswear, while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by double-digit percentage increases in Sportswear, Basketball and Men&#146;s Training. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, EBIT for Greater China grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher product prices, favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense, which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new China distribution center. \n\n&#160;\n\nJapan \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\nExcluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; Revenues by: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Footwear \n\n&#160; $ 438 &#160; &#160; $ 396 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; $ 433 &#160; &#160; &#160; -9 % &#160; &#160; -16 % Apparel \n\n&#160; &#160; 322 &#160; &#160; &#160; 302 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; -1 % &#160; &#160; 357 &#160; &#160; &#160; -15 % &#160; &#160; -22 % Equipment \n\n&#160; &#160; 69 &#160; &#160; &#160; 68 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; -4 % &#160; &#160; 92 &#160; &#160; &#160; -26 % &#160; &#160; -33 % TOTAL REVENUES &#160; $ 829 &#160; &#160; $ 766 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; $ 882 &#160; &#160; &#160; -13 % &#160; &#160; -21 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES &#160; $ 136 &#160; &#160; $ 114 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 180 &#160; &#160; &#160; -37 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nDuring fiscal 2012, the macroeconomic environment in Japan remained uncertain as the market continued to recover from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.

The increase in Japan&#146;s gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the year-over-year change in standard currency rates, a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of close-out sales. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nOn March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami. While the Company&#146;s organization and assets in Japan were not materially damaged, business results for the month of March 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined, driven by decreases across most key categories. Partially offsetting the decreases was double-digit percentage growth in revenues from Running apparel. \n\nThe decrease in Japan&#146;s EBIT for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable year-over-year standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on close-out sales, which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Emerging Markets \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\nExcluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; Revenues by: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Footwear \n\n&#160; $ 2,386 &#160; &#160; $ 1,897 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26 % &#160; &#160; 27 % &#160; $ 1,458 &#160; &#160; &#160; 30 % &#160; &#160; 24 % Apparel \n\n&#160; &#160; 815 &#160; &#160; &#160; 657 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 25 % &#160; &#160; 577 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 9 % Equipment \n\n&#160; &#160; 209 &#160; &#160; &#160; 182 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 163 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; 7 % TOTAL REVENUES &#160; $ 3,410 &#160; &#160; $ 2,736 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 % &#160; &#160; 26 % &#160; $ 2,198 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 19 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST \n\nAND TAXES \n\n&#160; $ 853 &#160; &#160; $ 688 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 521 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nExcluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the Emerging Markets increased 26% for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the Emerging Markets was driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and mid-single-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit, primarily reflective of product price increases.

Gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher product input costs, customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points, as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nExcluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Emerging Markets increased 19% for fiscal 2011. Most territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year, led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the Emerging Markets was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, EBIT for Emerging Markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of in-line product sales, lower warehousing costs and favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher full-price discounts. \n\n&#160;\n\nGlobal Brand Divisions \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 111 &#160; &#160; $ 96 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; $ 86 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; 16 % (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes &#160; &#160; (1,177 ) &#160; &#160; (971 ) &#160; &#160; -21 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (866 ) &#160; &#160; -12 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nGlobal Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Revenues for the Global Brand Divisions are attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, Global Brand Divisions&#146; loss before interest and taxes increased $206 million, primarily driven by increased investments in our digital business and infrastructure for our Direct to Consumer operations, higher sports marketing expense as well as higher personnel costs to support our global brand functions. \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the increase in Global Brand Divisions&#146; loss before interest and taxes was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased investments in sports marketing. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 25 ##TABLE_END Other Businesses \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change Excluding Currency Changes &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Converse \n\n&#160; $ 1,324 &#160; &#160; $ 1,131 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; $ 983 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 15 % NIKE Golf \n\n&#160; &#160; 726 &#160; &#160; &#160; 658 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; &#160; 670 &#160; &#160; &#160; -2 % &#160; &#160; -3 % Cole Haan \n\n&#160; &#160; 535 &#160; &#160; &#160; 521 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; 466 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; 12 % Hurley \n\n&#160; &#160; 248 &#160; &#160; &#160; 252 &#160; &#160; &#160; -2 % &#160; &#160; -1 % &#160; &#160; 222 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 13 % Umbro \n\n&#160; &#160; 262 &#160; &#160; &#160; 224 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 223 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 % &#160; &#160; 2 % TOTAL REVENUES &#160; $ 3,095 &#160; &#160; $ 2,786 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; $ 2,564 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; &#160; 8 % EARNINGS BEFORE \n\nINTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; $ 341 &#160; &#160; $ 335 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 298 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nOur Other Businesses are comprised of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 11%, reflecting growth across most businesses, led by Converse. The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased sales in North America and China, as well as increased revenues in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2011. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE Golf increased 9% for fiscal 2012, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our apparel business, partially offset by a single-digit percentage decline in our club business. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Umbro grew 14% primarily driven by sales growth in France due to our acquisition of the exclusive licensee and distributor in March 2011. For fiscal 2012, revenues for Cole Haan grew 3%, mostly driven by growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 11% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 2%, as earnings growth at Converse was mostly offset by losses at Umbro and Hurley. Higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues negatively affected profitability at both companies, while lower gross margins also contributed to the decline in Hurley&#146;s earnings. \n\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, Cole Haan and Umbro combined contributed $797 million and $745 million, respectively, in revenues to the Other Businesses portfolio, and losses before interest and taxes of $43 million and $18 million, respectively. \n\nWe are currently in the process of preparing these businesses for sale and identifying suitable buyers. Although we are unable to estimate the ultimate gains or losses on the sales of these businesses at this time, we anticipate we will in the future incur certain non-cash charges related to the divestiture of Umbro. Upon the sale of the business, or when the ultimate selling price becomes estimable, we expect to incur non-cash charges to liquidate certain balance sheet accounts, most significantly the cumulative translation adjustment and deferred tax assets related to Umbro. At May 31, 2012, the cumulative translation adjustment was $110 million, net of tax, and the deferred tax asset was $32 million. We may also incur other cash and non-cash charges related to the divestiture of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in China, as well as increased sales in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution. Revenues for Cole Haan increased 12%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high-single-digit percentage growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. Revenues declined at NIKE Golf, where we experienced significant erosion in our Japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. \n\nFor fiscal 2011, EBIT for our Other Businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues, primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts. Gross margin remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011, as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011. \n\n&#160;\n\nCorporate \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Fiscal 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2011 &#160; &#160; FY12 vs. FY11 % Change &#160; &#160; Fiscal 2010 &#160; &#160; FY11 vs. FY10 % Change &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ (39 ) &#160; $ (69 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; $ 7 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes &#160; &#160; (916 ) &#160; &#160; (805 ) &#160; &#160; -14 % &#160; &#160; (841 ) &#160; &#160; 4 % ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nCorporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses; corporate eliminations and other items. \n\nCorporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Other Businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, other conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Other Businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, Corporate expense grew $111 million, mainly due to an increase of $49 million in performance-based compensation and a year-over-year net increase of $73 million from foreign currency impacts. These foreign currency impacts were driven by a year-over-year increase in foreign currency net losses, arising from certain Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign currency hedges and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. The above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 \n\nFor fiscal 2011, the decrease in Corporate expense was primarily driven by year-over-year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Also contributing to the decrease in Corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a $54 million year-over-year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year. These benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses, primarily driven by higher wage-related expense. \n\n&#160;\n\nForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices \n\n&#160;\n\nOverview \n\n&#160;\n\nAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, such as the Euro and Chinese Renminbi, into U.S. Dollars. \n\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio, and where practical, by hedging a portion of the remaining material exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk on a portfolio basis by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of aggregate foreign exchange exposure. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. \n\n&#160;\n\nTransactional exposures \n\n&#160;\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Product Costs &#151; NIKE&#146;s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 1. Non-functional currency denominated product purchases: ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (&#147;NTC&#148;), a wholly-owned centralized sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from external factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from external factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2. Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories&#146; foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (&#147;factory currency exposure index&#148;) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (&#147;factory input costs&#148;) are denominated. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivatives and are recorded at fair value through other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16 &#151; Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE&#146;s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales &#151; A portion of our Western Europe and Central &#38; Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound, Polish Zloty) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Other Costs &#151; Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities &#151; Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 27 ##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures \n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product costs exposure as discussed below. As of May 31, 2012, there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to 24 months. The fair value of outstanding currency forward contracts at May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $183 million and $28 million in assets and $32 million and $136 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (&#147;OCI&#148;), a component of shareholders&#146; equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect consolidated earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. \n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. The fair value of undesignated instruments was $55 million and $9 million in assets and $20 million and $17 million in liabilities at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#151; Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 &#150; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded. \n\nTranslational exposures \n\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries&#146; non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders&#146; equity. In the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $268 million and $(28) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $74 million and $(16) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\nManaging translational exposures \n\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $27 million and $1 million in assets and $3 million and $21 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other expense (income), net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. \n\nThe combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense (income), net had an insignificant impact on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2012 and had a unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million for the year ended May 31, 2011. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#151; Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 &#151; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded. \n\nNet investments in foreign subsidiaries \n\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2012. At May 31, 2011, the fair value was $23 million in liabilities. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $22 million and $(23) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash Flow Activity \n\nCash provided by operations was $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2012 was net income of $2.2 billion. Our working capital was a net cash outflow of $799 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to a net cash outflow of $708 million for fiscal 2011. Our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses. Inventory at the end of fiscal 2012 increased 23% compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher product input costs as well as changes in product mix, which more than offset the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Inventory units for the NIKE Brand grew 10% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in futures orders and improved factory deliveries. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily driven by higher prepaid demand creation expenses around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. \n\nCash provided by investing activities was $514 million during fiscal 2012, compared to a use of cash of $1,021 million for fiscal 2011. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $1,124 million (net of purchases) in fiscal 2012, compared to net purchases of $537 million (net of sales and maturities) during fiscal 2011. \n\nCash used by financing activities was $2.1 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.0 billion for fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of long-term debt, notes payable, and dividends, which was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. \n\nIn fiscal 2012, we purchased 20.0 million shares of NIKE&#146;s class B common stock for $1.8 billion. These repurchases were made under the four-year, $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008, under which stock repurchase activities commenced in December 2009. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 50.3 million shares for $4.1 billion under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nOn November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billon with lender approval. The facility matures in November 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in December 2012. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, we had no amounts outstanding under our new committed revolving credit facility. \n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor&#146;s Corporation and Moody&#146;s Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed revolving credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2012, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. \n\nLiquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor&#146;s Corporation and Moody&#146;s Investor Services, respectively. \n\nOur previous $760 million shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission expired during fiscal 2012. No debt securities were issued under that shelf registration prior to its expiry. We may issue debt securities under a new shelf registration in fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs. \n\nAs of May 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of May 31, 2012. \n\nDespite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. \n\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the U.S. through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt, we would incur additional interest expense. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 29 ##TABLE_END Contractual Obligations \n\nOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2012 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Description of Commitment &#160; Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, &#160; (In millions) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; &#160; Thereafter &#160; &#160; Total &#160; Operating Leases &#160; $ 408 &#160; &#160; $ 387 &#160; &#160; $ 271 &#160; &#160; $ 224 &#160; &#160; $ 186 &#160; &#160; $ 662 &#160; &#160; $ 2,138 &#160; Long-term Debt &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; &#160; 59 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 109 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; &#160; 262 &#160; Endorsement Contracts (1) &#160; &#160; 856 &#160; &#160; &#160; 804 &#160; &#160; &#160; 686 &#160; &#160; &#160; 491 &#160; &#160; &#160; 363 &#160; &#160; &#160; 628 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,828 &#160; Product Purchase Obligations (2) &#160; &#160; 2,861 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,861 &#160; Other (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 320 &#160; &#160; &#160; 101 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38 &#160; &#160; &#160; 31 &#160; &#160; &#160; 91 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 582 &#160; TOTAL \n\n&#160; $ 4,494 &#160; &#160; $ 1,351 &#160; &#160; $ 1,004 &#160; &#160; $ 855 &#160; &#160; $ 649 &#160; &#160; $ 1,318 &#160; &#160; $ 9,671 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $285 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2012. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. \n\nWe also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2012. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7 &#151; Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; Outstanding as \n\nof May 31, 2012 \n\n&#160; Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand \n\n&#160; $ 108 &#160; Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port \n\n&#160; $ 75 &#160; ##TABLE_END As of May 31, 2012, letters of credit of $138 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company&#146;s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIn April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which became effective for us beginning March 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which became effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards became effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 30 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Recently Issued Accounting Standards \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity&#146;s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders&#146; equity. Companies will now be required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This guidance also required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. Both issuances on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \n\nWe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. \n\nWithin the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. \n\nIn some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. \n\nIn certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. \n\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. \n\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable \n\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. \n\nInventory Reserves \n\nWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 31 ##TABLE_END Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts \n\nA significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. \n\nSome of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. \n\nSome of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser&#146;s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. \n\nSome of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset&#146;s net book value to its salvage value. \n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group&#146;s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nWe perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill over its implied fair value if any. \n\nWe generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit&#146;s business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. \n\nOn May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. As of May 31, 2012, Cole Haan had no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet, while Umbro had $70 million of goodwill and $164 million of trademark and other intangible assets. As of May 31, 2012, both asset groups for Cole Haan and Umbro did not quality as &#147;assets-held-for-sale&#148; under applicable accounting guidance. The decision to divest these businesses was deemed a triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of Umbro&#146;s intangible assets at that date and was considered in our fourth quarter impairment analysis. We are currently in the process of preparing the businesses for divestiture and identifying potential acquirers. Therefore, we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the Umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. As discussed above, the asset groups for Umbro did not qualify as &#147;assets-held-for-sale&#148;; therefore, we did not consider potential disposition costs or cumulative translation adjustments in the carrying value of the Umbro reporting unit in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter impairment analysis. Because we are still in the preliminary stages of the divestiture process and have not yet identified potential acquirers or the likely deal structure, these methods represent our best estimate of the fair value of the Umbro business. Our analysis determined there was no impairment of intangible assets or goodwill related to Umbro. If the sales process indicates a fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit, an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charges exist at that point. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Fair Value Measurements \n\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. \n\nIn the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \n\nA majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. \n\nHedge Accounting for Derivatives \n\nWe use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense (income), net during the quarter in which such changes occur. \n\nWe use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders&#146; equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur. \n\nStock-based Compensation \n\nWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. \n\nTaxes \n\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. \n\nIn addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. \n\nWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. \n\nOn an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. \n\nOn a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 33 ##TABLE_END Other Contingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 34 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 179, "Negative": 261, "Polarity": -0.18636363594008265, "Subjectivity": 0.049134561691888935}, "similarity_score": 0.9962321916852467, "nlp_result": 0.1206585586977549}
