MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (&#147;MD&#38;A&#148;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. \n\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK \n\nMicrosoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play and communicate across a wide range of computing devices. \n\nWe generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services, by designing and selling hardware, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and services, and income taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustry Trends \n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. \n\nKey Opportunities and Investments \n\nBased on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth. \n\nSmart connected devices \n\nThe price per unit of processing, storage, and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability. This ongoing trend is increasing the capabilities of PCs, mobile, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications. At the same time, the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices. User experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart, connected devices. Microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect PCs and mobile and other devices through the cloud. We are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like Bing, Windows Live, and Xbox LIVE. Our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like Kinect, Windows, Windows Azure, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Xbox. \n\nCloud computing transforming the data center and information technology \n\nCloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. Computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost than smaller ones; larger data centers include diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns which improve the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As a result of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. For most businesses, the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center. We are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as Microsoft Dynamics Online, Microsoft SQL Azure, Office 365, Windows Azure, Windows Intune, and Windows Server. \n\nEntertainment \n\nThe evolution of hardware, software, services, and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices. These rich media experiences include games, movies, music, television, and social interactions with family, friends, and colleagues. At Microsoft, our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services. We invest significant resources in partnerships, content, Windows Phone, Xbox, and Xbox LIVE. \n\nSearch \n\nOver the last two decades, web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online, while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links. There is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ncomplete tasks more simply when using PC, mobile, and other devices. Our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent, and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual, social, and other elements which simplifies people&#146;s interaction with the Internet. We invest significant resources in Bing, SharePoint, Windows, and Windows Phone. \n\nCommunications and productivity \n\nPersonal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools. Over the last decade, Microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich Office client on the PC. Productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, which are increasingly powered by server-side applications. These server applications can be hosted by the customer, a partner, or by Microsoft in the cloud. There are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across PCs, mobile devices, and other devices that connect to services. We invest significant resources in Dynamics, Exchange, Lync, Office, Office 365, SharePoint, and Windows Live. \n\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges and Risks \n\nAs discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. We must anticipate changes in technology and business models. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. \n\nAt Microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market can be built internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition. \n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation. \n\nDemand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part 1, Item 1a. of this Form 10-K). \n\nSeasonality \n\nOur revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter. In addition, quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the &#147;Office Deferral&#148;) and sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of Windows 7 to retailers before general availability (the &#147;Windows 7 Deferral&#148;). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nSummary of Results for Fiscal Years 2011, 2010, and 2009 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 69,943 &#160; &#160; $ 62,484 &#160; &#160; $ 58,437 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12% &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 27,161 &#160; &#160; $ 24,098 &#160; &#160; $ 20,363 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; &#160; 18% &#160; Diluted earnings per share \n\n&#160; $ 2.69 &#160; &#160; $ 2.10 &#160; &#160; $ 1.62 &#160; &#160; &#160; 28% &#160; &#160; &#160; 30% &#160; ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nRevenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the Xbox 360 entertainment platform, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, and Server and Tools products, offset in part by lower Windows revenue. Revenue also increased due to the $254 million Office Deferral in fiscal year 2010 and the subsequent recognition of the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue. \n\nOperating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Cost of revenue increased $3.2 billion or 26%, due to higher costs associated with our online offerings, including traffic acquisition costs, and increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors sold. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Sales and marketing expenses increased $726 million or 5%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of the Xbox 360 platform, Windows Phone, and Windows and Windows Live, higher headcount-related expenses and increased fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Research and development expenses increased $329 million or 4%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; General and administrative expenses increased $159 million or 4%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses and new Puerto Rican excise taxes, partially offset by prior year transition expenses associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. \n\n##TABLE_END Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting higher revenue, repurchases of common stock, and lower income tax expense, offset in part by higher operating expenses. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nRevenue increased mainly due to strong sales of Windows 7, which was released during fiscal year 2010, and PC market improvement. Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Sales and marketing expenses increased $335 million or 3%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7 and Bing and increased sales force expenses related to Windows 7. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; General and administrative expenses increased $33 million or 1% due mainly to increased legal charges and transition expenses associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement, offset in part by a reduction in headcount-related expenses. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Cost of revenue increased $240 million or 2%, primarily reflecting increased online costs and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone, offset in part by decreased Xbox 360 console costs and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Research and development expenses decreased $296 million or 3%, primarily reflecting a decrease in third-party development and programming costs and increased capitalization of certain software development costs. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380 million shares during fiscal year 2010. \n\nSEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) \n\nThe revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 21 &#150; Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. \n\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts within this MD&#38;A to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving Microsoft&#146;s PC hardware business from Entertainment and Devices Division to Windows &#38; Windows Live Division, Windows Embedded from Entertainment and Devices Division to Server and Tools, and Office for Mac from Entertainment and Devices Division to Microsoft Business Division, as well as implementing intersegment cost allocations between all segments related to the collaborative investment in mobile platform development. \n\nWindows &#38; Windows Live Division \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 19,024 &#160; &#160; $ 19,494 &#160; &#160; $ 15,847 &#160; &#160; &#160; (2)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 23% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 12,281 &#160; &#160; $ 13,034 &#160; &#160; $ 9,790 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 33% &#160; ##TABLE_END Windows &#38; Windows Live Division (&#147;Windows Division&#148;) develops and markets PC operating systems, related software and online services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the user&#146;s hardware and software. Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products. \n\nWindows Division revenue is largely correlated to the PC market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (&#147;OEMs&#148;) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue (&#147;other revenue&#148;) is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nWindows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 11% this year and sales of PCs to consumers declined approximately 1%. The decline in consumer PC sales included an approximately 32% decline in the sales of netbooks. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 2% to 4%. Revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred Windows XP revenue. Considering the impact of Windows 7 launch in the prior year, including $273 million of revenue recognized related to the Windows 7 Deferral, we estimate that Windows Division revenue was in line with the PC market. \n\nWindows Division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $224 million or 8% reflecting increased advertising of Windows and Windows Live. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nWindows Division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 16% to 18%. OEM revenue increased $2.6 billion or 22%, while OEM license units increased 21%. The OEM revenue increase was driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, and the mix of versions of Windows licensed, offset in part by PC market changes, including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer PCs versus business PCs. Fiscal year 2009 OEM revenue reflects a $273 million Windows 7 Deferral. This amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010. Other revenue increased $970 million or 26% driven primarily by Windows 7 retail sales. \n\nWindows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $258 million or 11% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7. Cost of revenue increased $251 million or 14%, primarily driven by traffic acquisition costs and royalties. \n\nServer and Tools \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 17,096 &#160; &#160; $ 15,378 &#160; &#160; $ 14,601 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 6,608 &#160; &#160; $ 5,539 &#160; &#160; $ 4,816 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19% &#160; &#160; &#160; 15% &#160; ##TABLE_END Server and Tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings include Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure, Visual Studio, System Center products, Windows Embedded device platforms, and Enterprise Services. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes primarily from multi-year volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nServer and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product sales and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server, Enterprise CAL Suites, and Windows Embedded, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Enterprise Services revenue grew $337 million or 11%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services. \n\nServer and Tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $366 million or 13%, primarily reflecting a $323 million increase in expenses from providing Enterprise Services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $264 million or 6% reflecting increased fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors and increased corporate marketing activities. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nServer and Tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. Product revenue increased $784 million or 7%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server and Enterprise CAL Suites revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. Enterprise Services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in Premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by increased cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $65 million or 2%, reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and hosting costs. \n\nOnline Services Division \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 2,528 &#160; &#160; $ 2,201 &#160; &#160; $ 2,121 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15% &#160; &#160; &#160; 4% &#160; Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (2,557 ) &#160; $ (2,337 ) &#160; $ (1,641 ) &#160; &#160; (9)% &#160; &#160; &#160; (42)% &#160; ##TABLE_END Online Services Division (&#147;OSD&#148;) develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and that help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, MSN, adCenter, and advertiser tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising. Search and display advertising generally accounts for nearly all of OSD&#146;s annual revenue. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nOSD revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. Online advertising revenue grew $358 million or 19% to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth, relative share gains in the U.S., and our Yahoo! alliance, offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adCenter platform for the new mix and volume of traffic from the combined Yahoo! and Bing properties. As of June 30, 2011, according to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share grew over 31% to approximately 14%, while Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 27%. \n\nOSD operating loss increased due to higher operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue grew $641 million driven by costs associated with the Yahoo! search agreement and increased traffic acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $157 million or 60% due mainly to transition expenses in the prior year associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. Research and development increased $117 million or 11% due to increased headcount-related costs. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nOSD revenue increased reflecting increased online advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased Access (dial-up internet) revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $146 million or 8% to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased advertiser and publisher tools revenue. Access revenue decreased $57 million or 31%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. \n\nOSD operating loss increased due to increased operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $567 million, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs and Yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs. General and administrative expenses increased $135 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased $51 million or 5% due mainly to increased marketing of Bing, offset in part by decreased headcount-related expenses. \n\nMicrosoft Business Division \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 22,186 &#160; &#160; $ 19,076 &#160; &#160; $ 19,257 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16% &#160; &#160; &#160; (1)% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 14,124 &#160; &#160; $ 11,504 &#160; &#160; $ 11,365 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23% &#160; &#160; &#160; 1% &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Division (&#147;MBD&#148;) develops and markets software and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nMBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, the $254 million Office Deferral during fiscal year 2010, and the subsequent recognition of the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2011. Business revenue increased $2.0 billion or 13%, reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 10% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $1.1 billion or 33%, approximately half of which was attributable to the launch of Office 2010 and half of which was attributable to the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2010 and subsequent recognition of the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2011. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue increased $620 million or 17% due to sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system. \n\nMBD operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $335 million or 26%, primarily driven by higher online costs and services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $97 million or 2%, primarily driven by an increase in corporate and cross-platform marketing activities. Research and development costs increased $79 million or 4%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs in the prior year. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nMBD revenue decreased primarily as a result of the net deferral of $254 million of revenue related to the Office 2010 Deferral. Consumer revenue decreased $142 million or 4%, primarily due to the Office 2010 Deferral, offset in part by growth in the PC market and sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Business revenue decreased $39 million, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue and licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers. Microsoft Dynamics revenue was flat. \n\nMBD operating income increased due mainly to decreased operating expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $203 million or 5%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses decreased $202 million or 9%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $50 million or 17% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of Fast Search &#38; Transfer ASA (&#147;FAST&#148;) and lower headcount-related expenses. These decreases were offset in part by a $135 million or 12% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services. \n\nEntertainment and Devices Division \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 8,913 &#160; &#160; $ 6,168 &#160; &#160; $ 6,416 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45% &#160; &#160; &#160; (4)% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 1,324 &#160; &#160; $ 618 &#160; &#160; $ 351 &#160; &#160; &#160; 114% &#160; &#160; &#160; 76% &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEntertainment and Devices Division (&#147;EDD&#148;) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people.

In November 2010, we released Kinect for Xbox 360 and the latest version of Windows Phone. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nEDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $2.7 billion or 48%, led by increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles, sales of Kinect sensors, and higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 13.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2011, compared with 10.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2010. \n\nEDD operating income increased primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $1.8 billion or 49% primarily reflecting higher volumes of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect sensors sold, and increased royalty costs resulting from increased sales of Xbox LIVE digital content. Research and development expenses increased $119 million or 12%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related costs. Sales and marketing expenses grew $90 million or 12% primarily reflecting increased Xbox 360 platform marketing activities. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nEDD revenue decreased reflecting decreased revenue from Xbox 360 platform and PC games. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $12 million, primarily reflecting a reduction in Xbox 360 consoles sold and revenue per console, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 10.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2010, compared with 11.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2009. Non-gaming revenue decreased $197 million or 25% primarily reflecting decreased Zune and Windows Phone revenue. \n\nEDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $496 million or 12%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalty costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sales and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone. Sales and marketing costs decreased $75 million or 9%, primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 platform marketing activities. Research and development expenses increased $54 million or 6%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses, offset in part by decreased third-party development and programming costs. \n\nCorporate-Level Activity \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2011 Versus 2010 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2010 Versus 2009 &#160; Corporate-level activity \n\n&#160; $ &#160;(4,619 ) &#160; $ &#160;(4,260 ) &#160; $ &#160;(4,318 ) &#160; &#160; (8)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 1% &#160; ##TABLE_END Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; and legal settlements and contingencies. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nCorporate-level expenses increased due mainly to new Puerto Rican excise taxes, certain revenue related sales and marketing expenses, and increased headcount-related expenses. These increases were offset in part by lower legal charges, which were $332 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to $533 million in fiscal year 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nCorporate-level expenses decreased due mainly to employee severance charges of $330 million incurred in the prior year, decreased partner payments, and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts.

During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, general and administrative expenses included employee severance expense of $59 million and $330 million, respectively, associated with a resource management program that was announced in January 2009 and completed in fiscal year 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND INCOME TAXES \n\nOther Income (Expense) \n\nThe components of other income (expense) were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Year Ended June 30, &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; Dividends and interest income \n\n&#160; $ 900 &#160; &#160; $ 843 &#160; &#160; $ 744 &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160; (295 ) &#160; &#160; (151 ) &#160; &#160; (38 ) Net recognized gains (losses) on investments \n\n&#160; &#160; 439 &#160; &#160; &#160; 348 &#160; &#160; &#160; (125 ) Net losses on derivatives \n\n&#160; &#160; (77 ) &#160; &#160; (140 ) &#160; &#160; (558 ) Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements \n\n&#160; &#160; (26 ) &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; (509 ) Other \n\n&#160; &#160; (31 ) &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; (56 ) &#160; &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 910 &#160; &#160; $ 915 &#160; &#160; $ (542 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). These are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nDividends and interest income increased due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by fewer gains on sales of fixed-income securities. Derivative losses decreased due primarily to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nDividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in May 2009. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period. Other-than-temporary impairments were $69 million during fiscal year 2010, as compared with $862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period. Net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of $509 million in the prior year, which had resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the prior year. For fiscal year 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18% and 25%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are subject to \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nlower income tax rates. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our U.S. income before income taxes was $8.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 32% and 38%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the foreign income before income taxes was $19.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 68% and 62%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16% and 12%, respectively. \n\nIn addition, our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the I.R.S. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. This partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million. \n\nTax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.4 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $44.8 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because they are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $14.2 billion as of June 30, 2011. \n\nWhile we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the I.R.S. completed its examination and issued a Revenue Agent&#146;s Report (&#147;RAR&#148;) for the remaining unresolved items. We do not agree with the adjustments in the RAR, and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process. The proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably; however, we believe our existing reserves are adequate. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2010. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nOur effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were approximately 25% and 27%, respectively. In fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 12% and 9%, respectively, reflecting the mix of U.S. and international income before income taxes and the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to international income. In fiscal years 2010 and 2009, foreign income before income taxes was $15.4 billion and $14.3 billion, respectively. \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $52.8 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared with $36.8 billion as of June 30, 2010. Equity and other investments were $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared with $7.8 billion as of June 30, 2010. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of June 30, 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOf the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2011, approximately $45 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $379 million. As of June 30, 2011, approximately 68% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 12% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. \n\nSecurities lending \n\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2011. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $1.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. \n\nValuation \n\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. treasuries. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. \n\nCash Flows \n\nFiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 \n\nCash flows from operations increased $2.9 billion during the current fiscal year to $27.0 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $4.9 billion to $8.4 billion due mainly to a $5.8 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $602 million increase in cash paid for dividends. Cash used in investing increased $3.3 billion to $14.6 billion due to a $5.8 billion increase in purchases of investments, offset in part by a $2.5 billion increase in cash from securities lending. \n\nFiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 \n\nCash flow from operations increased $5.0 billion, primarily due to payment of $4.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year. Cash used for financing increased $5.8 billion, primarily due to a $5.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nbillion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of short-term and long-term debt. Financing activities also included a $1.9 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, which was offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued. Cash used for investing decreased $4.5 billion due to a $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities along with a $1.1 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment. \n\nDebt \n\nShort-term debt \n\nDuring fiscal year 2011, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper, leaving zero outstanding. \n\nOn November 5, 2010, our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expired. This facility served as a back-up for our commercial paper program. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented. \n\nLong-term debt \n\nWe issued debt during the periods presented to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our superior credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases. \n\nAs of June 30, 2011, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $4.9 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2010. The estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of June 30, 2011 and 2010, as applicable. \n\nThe components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of June 30, 2011: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Due Date &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Notes \n\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConvertible Debt \n\nIn June 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. As of June 30, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $38 million. \n\nPrior to March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft&#146;s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. \n\nBecause the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders&#146; equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders&#146; equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt. \n\nIn connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders&#146; equity. \n\nUnearned Revenue \n\nUnearned revenue at June 30, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; OEM minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. \n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2011: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; Three Months Ending, &#160; &#160; &#160; September 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; $ 5,979 &#160; December 31, 2011 \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,914 &#160; March 31, 2012 \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,207 &#160; June 30, 2012 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,622 &#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,398 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 17,120 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nOn September 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 (the &#147;2007 Programs&#148;) to buy back up to $40.0 billion of Microsoft common stock. On September 22, 2008, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of September 30, 2013 (the &#147;2008 Program&#148;). As of June 30, 2011, approximately $12.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. \n\nDuring the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 447 million shares for $11.5 billion during fiscal year 2011; 380 million shares for $10.8 billion during fiscal year 2010; and 318 million shares for $8.2 billion during fiscal year 2009. All shares repurchased in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were repurchased under the 2008 Program.

To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2011. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2013-2015 &#160; &#160; 2016-2018 &#160; &#160; 2019 and Thereafter &#160; &#160; Total &#160; Long-term debt: (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Principal payments \n\n&#160; $ 0 &#160; &#160; $ 4,250 &#160; &#160; $ 2,500 &#160; &#160; $ 5,250 &#160; &#160; $ 12,000 &#160; Interest payments \n\n&#160; &#160; 344 &#160; &#160; &#160; 959 &#160; &#160; &#160; 720 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,228 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,251 &#160; Construction commitments (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 263 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 263 &#160; Operating leases (c) \n\n&#160; &#160; 481 &#160; &#160; &#160; 964 &#160; &#160; &#160; 380 &#160; &#160; &#160; 127 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,952 &#160; Purchase commitments (d) \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,580 &#160; &#160; &#160; 355 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,935 &#160; Other long-term liabilities (e) \n\n&#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 92 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; &#160; 136 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total contractual obligations \n\n&#160; $ 6,668 &#160; &#160; $ 6,620 &#160; &#160; $ 3,622 &#160; &#160; $ 8,627 &#160; &#160; $ 25,537 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) See Note 12 &#150; Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) These amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (c) These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (d) These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (e) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $8.8 billion and other long-term contingent liabilities of $276 million (related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits) from the amounts presented, as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue of $1.4 billion and non-cash items of $279 million. \n\n##TABLE_END Other Planned Uses of Capital \n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. \n\nDefinitive Agreement with Skype \n\nOn May 10, 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with Skype Global S.&#224;.r.l. (&#147;Skype&#148;) under which we would acquire Skype, a leading internet communications company, for $8.5 billion in cash. We anticipate the acquisition will extend Skype&#146;s brand and reach of its network platform, while enhancing our existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We obtained regulatory approval in the U.S. and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory approvals during calendar year 2011. \n\nLiquidity \n\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nshort-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. \n\nShould we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. \n\nAs a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $6.3 billion at June 30, 2011. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nOn July 1, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nOn July 1, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on the consolidation of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012 and will have presentation changes only. \n\nIn May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. Additionally, the new guidance \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nexpands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. \n\nIn January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nSoftware revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. \n\nImpairment of Investment Securities \n\nInvestments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \n\nGoodwill \n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Among our reporting units, the fair value of OSD has been the closest to its carrying value. The carrying value of OSD&#146;s goodwill was $6.4 billion as of June 30, 2011. \n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \n\nResearch and Development Costs \n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements. \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT&#146;S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management&#146;s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. \n\nThe Company engaged Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). \n\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Steven A. Ballmer Chief Executive Officer Peter S.
