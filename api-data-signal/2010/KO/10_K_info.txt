MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") is intended to help the reader understand The Coca-Cola Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to &#151; and should be read in conjunction with &#151; our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&#38;A, which includes the following sections: \n\n&#149; Our Business &#151; a general description of our business and the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. &#149; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. &#149; Operations Review &#151; an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. Except to the extent that differences among our operating segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion in the MD&#38;A on a consolidated basis. &#149; Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#151; an analysis of cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations; foreign exchange; an overview of financial position; and the impact of inflation and changing prices. 33 \n\nOur Business \n\nGeneral \n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company. We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. Along with Coca-Cola, which is recognized as the world's most valuable brand, we own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. \n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers &#151; the world's largest beverage distribution system. Of the approximately 55 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day, beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for approximately 1.7 billion. \n\nWe believe that our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. \n\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets &#151; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#151; to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. \n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells: \n\n&#149; beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate business\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and &#149; finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished products business\" or \"finished products operations\"). Generally, finished products operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. \n\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us &#151; such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles &#151; and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\nOur finished products operations consist primarily of the production, sales and distribution operations managed by CCR and our Company-owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations. CCR is included in our North America operating segment, and our Company-owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished products operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Concentrate operations 1 &#160; &#160; 51 % &#160; 54 % &#160; 54 % Finished products operations 2 &#160; &#160; 49 3 &#160; 46 &#160; &#160; 46 &#160; &#160; &#160; Net operating revenues &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; 100 % &#160; 100 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 Includes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. &#160; 2 Includes fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. &#160; 3 Includes net operating revenues related to the acquired CCE North American business from October 2, 2010. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Concentrate operations 1 &#160; &#160; 76 % &#160; 78 % &#160; 77 % Finished products operations 2 &#160; &#160; 24 3 &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; &#160; Total worldwide unit case volume &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; 100 % &#160; 100 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 Includes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. &#160; 2 Includes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. &#160; 3 Includes unit case volume related to the acquired CCE North American business from October 2, 2010. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAcquisition of CCE's North American Business and Related Transactions \n\nPursuant to the terms of the business separation and merger agreement entered into on February 25, 2010, as amended (the \"merger agreement\"), on October 2, 2010 (the \"acquisition date\"), we acquired CCE's North American business, consisting of CCE's production, sales and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and a substantial majority of CCE's corporate segment. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. \n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCE's North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Company's 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCE's North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as \"New CCE\") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. \n\nAs of October 1, 2010, our Company owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. Based on the closing price of CCE's common stock on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition date, the fair value of our investment in CCE was approximately $5,373 million, which reflected the fair value of our ownership in both CCE's North American business and its European operations. We remeasured our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon \n\nthe close of the transaction. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $4,978 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statement of income. The gain included a $137 million reclassification adjustment related to foreign currency translation gains recognized upon the disposal of our indirect investment in CCE's European operations. The Company relinquished its indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations to New CCE as part of the consideration to acquire the 67 percent of CCE's North American business that was not already owned by the Company. \n\nAlthough the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. \n\nIn contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C' Plus in Canada, and we made a net one-time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20-year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca-Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of CCE's North American business, we granted to New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in our German bottler at any time from 18 to 39 months after February 25, 2010, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. \n\nThe Nonalcoholic Beverages Segment of the Commercial Beverages Industry \n\nWe operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. \n\nOur Objective \n\nOur objective is to use our formidable assets &#151; brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and a strong commitment by our management and associates worldwide &#151; to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: \n\n&#149; People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. &#149; Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people's desires and needs. &#149; Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. &#149; Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. &#149; Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. &#149; Productivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. 36 \n\nStrategic Priorities \n\nWe have four strategic priorities designed to create long-term sustainable growth for our Company and the Coca-Cola system and value for our shareowners. These strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership; accelerating innovation; leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio; and leading the Coca-Cola system for growth. To enable the entire Coca-Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; franchise leadership; and bottling and distribution operations. \n\nCore Capabilities \n\nConsumer Marketing \n\nMarketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands. This produces long-term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions. \n\nWe have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our most developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our most developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. \n\nWe are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment. \n\nCommercial Leadership \n\nThe Coca-Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customer's business and needs, whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. \n\nFranchise Leadership \n\nWe must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Company's success. We work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. Our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca-Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. \n\nBottling and Distribution Operations \n\nWhile most of our Company beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independently owned and managed bottling partners, the Company has had a significant increase in the number of consolidated bottling and distribution operations over the last several years. We often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. \n\nAs a Company we have a long history of providing world-class customer service, demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce. In addition, we have an experienced bottler management team. All of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations. \n\nThe Company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business. This includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers. As we further transform the way we go to market the Company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient. \n\nChallenges and Risks \n\nBeing a global company provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. \n\nOur management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our Company. Of these, four key challenges and risks are discussed below. \n\nObesity and Inactive Lifestyles. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry. We recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line, which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water products. Our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace; supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education; and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. We are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments, educators and consumers through science-based solutions and programs. \n\nWater Quality and Quantity. Water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Company's attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. It is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution and poor management. Our Company is in an excellent position to share the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve &#151; water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems, and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. We are actively engaged in assessing the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects. We are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource. \n\nEvolving Consumer Preferences. Consumers want more choices. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs, desires and lifestyle choices. \n\nIncreased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace. Our Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share. \n\nAll four of these challenges and risks &#151; obesity and inactive lifestyles, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences, and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace &#151; have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. \n\nSee also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n\n&#149; Basis of Presentation &#149; Principles of Consolidation &#149; Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions &#149; Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets &#149; Pension Plan Valuations &#149; Revenue Recognition &#149; Income Taxes &#149; Contingencies Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result. \n\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are increased or decreased by our proportionate share of the net income or loss and other comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\") of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also decreased by dividends we receive from the investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. \n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. \n\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the change in fair value being included in the determination of net income. The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option; and therefore, we only measure assets and liabilities at fair value if required under other accounting guidance. \n\nCertain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a VIE. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $1,274 million and $624 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $191 million and $84 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. \n\nThe information presented above reflects the impact of the Company's adoption of accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to VIEs in June 2009. This accounting guidance resulted in a change in our accounting policy effective January 1, 2010. Among other things, the guidance requires more qualitative than quantitative analyses to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, enhances disclosures about an enterprise's involvement with a VIE, and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE. \n\nBeginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of this change in accounting policy. These entities are primarily bottling operations and had previously been consolidated due to certain loan guarantees and/or other financial support given by the Company. These financial arrangements, although not significant to our consolidated financial statements, resulted in a disproportionate relationship between our voting interests in these entities and our exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of the entities. As a result, we determined that we held a majority of the variable interests in these entities and, therefore, were deemed to be the primary beneficiary \n\nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as of December 31, 2009. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Consequently, subsequent to the change in accounting policy, the Company deconsolidated the majority of these VIEs. \n\nThe entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company in 2009, and we have accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting since January 1, 2010. Although the deconsolidation of these entities impacted individual line items in our consolidated financial statements, the impact on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company in future periods will be nominal. The equity method of accounting is intended to be a single line consolidation and, therefore, generally should result in the same net income attributable to the investor as would be the case if the investee had been consolidated. The main impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2010 was that, instead of these entities' results of operations and balance sheets affecting our consolidated line items, our proportionate share of net income or loss from these entities was reported in equity income (loss) &#151; net, in our consolidated income statements, and our investment in these entities was reported as equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes and New License Agreements\" for additional information. \n\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions \n\nThe Company adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on January 1, 2009, which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis. In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. We estimate fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets. Management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Company's results of operations. \n\nTransaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in the Company's consolidated statements of income. \n\nIn 2010, we acquired CCE's North American business and recorded total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. The assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that are subject to the significant estimates described above. Our acquisition accounting is not complete and adjustments may be recorded in future periods as appraisals for intangible assets and certain fixed assets are completed. Refer to the heading \"Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets,\" below, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to this acquisition. \n\nRecoverability of Noncurrent Assets \n\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. \n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated income statements. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. \n\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, prices, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation; and therefore, we do not believe it is practicable to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. \n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging markets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#151; Challenges and Risks,\" above, and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. \n\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities \n\nThe carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. Refer to the heading \"Basis of Presentation,\" above, for information related to how the carrying values of our equity method investments are determined. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value, if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. \n\nThe following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2010 &#160; &#160; Carrying Value &#160; &#160; Percentage of Total Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; Equity method investments &#160; &#160; $ 6,954 &#160; &#160; 10 % Securities classified as available-for-sale &#160; &#160; 485 &#160; &#160; * &#160; Securities classified as trading &#160; &#160; 209 &#160; &#160; * &#160; Cost method investments &#160; &#160; 159 &#160; &#160; * &#160; Securities classified as held-to-maturity &#160; &#160; 111 &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; $ 7,918 &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInvestments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in developing and emerging markets, may impact the determination of fair value. \n\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were approximately $267 million and $5 million, respectively. Management assessed each individual investment with unrealized losses to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary. Based on these assessments, management determined that the decline in fair value of each of these investments was temporary in nature. We will continue to monitor these investments in future periods. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2010, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $41 million related to certain available-for-sale securities and an equity method investment. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (loss) &#151; net and impacted the Bottling Investments and Corporate operating segments. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2009, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $27 million in other income (loss) &#151; net as a result of an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of a cost method investment. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of this investment approximated the Company's carrying value in the investment. However, in 2009, the Company was informed by the investee of its intent to reorganize its capital structure in 2009, which resulted in the Company's shares in the investee being canceled. As a result, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of this cost method investment was other than temporary. This impairment charge impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2008, the Company had several investments classified as available-for-sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of the investment, each of which initially occurred between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2008. Management determined that the decline in fair value of each investment was other than temporary, and the Company recognized impairment charges of approximately $81 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. These impairment charges were recorded to other income (loss) &#151; net in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2010 &#160; Fair Value &#160; Carrying Value &#160; Difference &#160; &#160; &#160; Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. &#160; $ 4,740 &#160; $ 1,315 &#160; $ 3,425 &#160; Coca-Cola Amatil Limited &#160; 2,322 &#160; 948 &#160; 1,374 &#160; Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. &#160; 2,204 &#160; 1,336 &#160; 868 &#160; Coca-Cola Icecek A.S. &#160; 692 &#160; 183 &#160; 509 &#160; Coca-Cola Embonor S.A. &#160; 480 &#160; 284 &#160; 196 &#160; Grupo Continental, S.A.B. &#160; 439 &#160; 175 &#160; 264 &#160; Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A. &#160; 160 &#160; 96 &#160; 64 &#160; Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated &#160; 138 &#160; 83 &#160; 55 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 11,175 &#160; $ 4,420 &#160; $ 6,755 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOther Assets \n\nOur Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. \n\nIn 2010, as a result of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, the Company recorded a charge of $265 million related to preexisting relationships. The charge was primarily related to the write-off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. Our investment in these infrastructure programs with CCE did not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset subsequent to the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was approximately $14,727 million, or 20 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2010 &#160; &#160; Carrying Value &#160; &#160; Percentage of Total Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; Goodwill &#160; &#160; $ 11,665 &#160; &#160; 16 % Bottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives &#160; &#160; 7,511 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; Trademarks with indefinite lives &#160; &#160; 6,356 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; Definite-lived intangible assets, net &#160; &#160; 1,264 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; Other intangible assets not subject to amortization &#160; &#160; 113 &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; $ 26,909 &#160; &#160; 37 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as business units. These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. In 2010, the Company combined several reporting units within our Europe operating segment. In addition, we also combined several reporting units within our Pacific operating segment. These changes were the result of the Company's productivity initiatives. \n\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the \n\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. \n\nAs of our most recent annual impairment review, the Company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets, individually or in the aggregate. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. However, if macroeconomic conditions worsen, it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets, which would require us to recognize impairment charges. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods. \n\nIn 2010, we acquired CCE's North American business, which resulted in the Company recording $13,878 million of intangible assets, including goodwill. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquired intangible assets included $5,705 million of bottler franchise rights, which consisted of $5,100 million of franchise rights with indefinite lives and $605 million of franchise rights with definite lives. The franchise rights with indefinite lives represent franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute certain beverages in specified territories. The franchise rights with definite lives relate to franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive rights to manufacture and/or distribute certain beverages in specified territories for a finite period of time and, therefore, have been classified as definite-lived intangible assets. \n\nThe bottler franchise rights acquired by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business include the contractual rights previously impaired by CCE. In 2008, CCE recorded pretax impairment charges of approximately $7.6 billion ($4.9 billion after-tax), which reduced the carrying value of CCE's North American franchise rights to zero. The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE's North American franchise rights was the result of several factors including, but not limited to, (1) challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for higher-margin packages and certain higher-margin beverage categories; (2) increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum, HFCS and resin; (3) increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs; (4) a dramatic increase in market debt rates, which impacted the capital charge; and (5) a significant decline in the funded status of CCE's defined benefit pension plans. Similar factors may also potentially result in future impairments. In 2008, the Company's proportionate share of these impairment charges recorded by CCE was approximately $1.6 billion, which we recorded to equity income (loss) &#151; net. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Equity Income (Loss) &#151; Net\" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company recorded $7,746 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition, which is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the North America operating segment. This goodwill is primarily related to synergistic value created from having a unified operating system that will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. \n\nIn 2009, the Company recognized a $23 million impairment charge due to a change in the expected useful life of an intangible asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Other Operating Charges,\" and Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nHyperinflationary Economies \n\nOur Company conducts business in more than 200 countries, some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years. These economies create financial exposure to the Company. Venezuela was deemed to be a hyperinflationary economy subsequent to December 31, 2009. \n\nAs of December 31, 2009, two main exchange rate mechanisms existed in Venezuela. The first exchange rate mechanism is known as the official rate of exchange (\"official rate\"), which is set by the Venezuelan government. In order to utilize the official rate, entities must seek approval from the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (\"CADIVI\"). As of December 31, 2009, the official rate set by the Venezuelan government was 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The second exchange rate mechanism was known as the parallel rate, which in some circumstances provided entities with a more liquid exchange through the use of a series of transactions via a broker. \n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2009, Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy, and the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official rate to 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods and 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods. In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. As a result, we remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets. The loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statement of income. We classified the impact of the remeasurement loss in the line item effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\nIn early June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system known as the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (\"SITME\"). This new system, which is subject to annual limits, replaced the parallel market whereby entities domiciled in Venezuela are able to exchange their bolivar to U.S. dollars through authorized financial institutions (commercial banks, savings and lending institutions, etc.). \n\nIn December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that it was eliminating the official rate of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods. As a result, there are only two exchange rates available for remeasuring bolivar-denominated transactions as of December 31, 2010, the official rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods and the SITME rate. As discussed above, the Company has remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar since January 1, 2010. Therefore, the elimination of the official rate for essential goods had no impact on the remeasurement of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to use the official exchange rate for nonessential goods to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary. If the official exchange rate devalues further, it would result in our Company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government-approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition, we have certain intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. If we are unable to utilize a government-approved exchange rate mechanism for concentrate sales, or if the bolivar further devalues, it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our accounts receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela and intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela was approximately $135 million. The revenues and cash flows associated with concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela in 2011 are not anticipated to be significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\nOur Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. \n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation. \n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the weighted-average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was 5.5 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long-term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our net periodic benefit cost was 8.0 percent in both 2010 and 2009. \n\nIn 2010, the Company's total pension expense was $176 million. In 2011, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $240 million. The expected increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The estimated impact of an additional 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $21 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $20 million. \n\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. \n\nOur customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were approximately $5.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined, and have historically not been significant. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. \n\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. \n\nTax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. \n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2010, the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $950 million and are primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. This criteria is met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but is not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other \n\nfactors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability, and asset risk. As of December 31, 2010, undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $20.8 billion. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent in 2011. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2011. \n\nContingencies \n\nOur Company is subject to various claims and contingencies, mostly related to legal proceedings and tax matters (both income taxes and indirect taxes). Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings, tax matters or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nRecent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements \n\nRefer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. \n\nOperations Review \n\nOur organizational structure as of December 31, 2010, consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as \"operating groups\" or \"groups\": Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements \n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance. \n\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" below. \n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" below. \n\nOur Bottling Investments segment and our other finished products operations, including those managed by CCR, typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these finished products operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate \n\nsales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" below. \n\n\"Structural changes\" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of consolidated bottlers. \n\nThe Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. \n\n\"Acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the current year. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. \n\n\"License agreements\" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and we derive an economic benefit from the ultimate sale of these brands. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. \n\nThe following significant transactions and agreements impacted the Company's 2010 operating results: \n\n&#149; on October 2, 2010, in legally separate transactions, we acquired CCE's North American business and entered into a license agreement with DPS; &#149; on October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE; and &#149; on January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities, primarily bottling operations, as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact that each of the aforementioned items had on the Company's consolidated financial statements is discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. The sections below are intended to provide an overview of the impact these items had on our 2010 operating results and are expected to have on key metrics used by management. \n\nAcquisition of CCE's North American Business and the DPS License Agreements \n\nImmediately prior to the October 2, 2010 completion of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, the Company owned 33 percent of CCE's outstanding common stock. This ownership represented our indirect ownership interest in both CCE's North American business and its European operations. On October 2, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining 67 percent of CCE's North American business not already owned by the Company for consideration that included the Company's indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations. As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100 percent of CCE's North American business and does not own any interest in New CCE's European operations. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#151; General,\" above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the acquisition. \n\nThe operating results of CCE's North American business are included in our consolidated financial statements effective October 2, 2010. The operating results of New CCE had no direct impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, since we have no ownership interest in this entity. CCE's North American business contributed net revenues of approximately $3,637 million and net losses of approximately $122 million from October 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Furthermore, the Company recorded total assets as a result of the acquisition of $22.2 billion. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position,\" below, for additional information related to the impact the acquisition had on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, the Company also entered into an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where these brands were distributed by CCE prior to our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#151; General,\" above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these new license agreements. \n\nPrior to the acquisition of CCE's North American business and entering into the DPS license agreements, the Company's North America operating segment was predominantly a concentrate operation. As a result of the acquisition of CCE's North American business and the DPS license agreements, the North America operating segment is now predominantly a finished products operation. Generally, finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins compared to concentrate operations. Refer to \"Item 1. Business &#151; Products and Brands,\" for additional discussion of the differences between the Company's concentrate operations and our finished products operations. These transactions resulted in higher net operating revenues, but lower gross profit margins and operating margins for the North America operating segment and our consolidated operating results. \n\nPrior to the acquisition of CCE's North American business, the Company reported unit case volume for the sale of Company beverage products sold by CCE. After the transaction closing, we reported unit case volume of Company beverage products just as we had prior to the transaction. \n\nPrior to the acquisition of CCE's North American business, the Company recognized concentrate sales volume at the time we sold the concentrate to CCE. Upon the closing of the transaction, we do not recognize the concentrate sales volume until CCR has sold finished products manufactured from concentrate to a customer. \n\nThe DPS license agreements impact both the Company's unit case and concentrate sales volume. Sales made pursuant to these license agreements represent acquired volume and are incremental unit case volume and concentrate sales volume to the Company. Prior to entering into the license agreements, the Company did not include the DPS brands as unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as these brands were not Company beverage products. As mentioned above, we do not normally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. However, in the case of the DPS license agreements, given their correlation to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, we have included the impact of these license agreements as a structural change when explaining our 2010 financial results. \n\nSince we have determined it is appropriate to include the impact of the DPS license agreements as a structural change, the total revenues attributable to CCE's North American business, including DPS, recognized by the Company since the date of acquisition are considered a structural change. \n\nPrior to the acquisition, we recognized the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sold to CCE's North American business until the finished products manufactured from those concentrates are sold. For example, in 2010, most of our pre-Easter concentrate sales to CCE impacted our first quarter operating results. In 2011, we anticipate that most of our Easter-related finished product sales will likely impact our second quarter operating results. Likewise, in 2010, most of our pre-July 4th concentrate sales to CCE impacted our second quarter operating results. In 2011, the impact of the July 4th holiday-related finished product sales will likely impact our third quarter operating results. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not have an indirect ownership interest in New CCE's European operations. Therefore, we are no longer required to defer the portion of revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales to New CCE. \n\nIn 2010, the gross profit for our North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the acquisition. Refer to the headings \"Gross Profit Margin\" and \"Operating Income and Operating Margin.\" \n\nThe acquisition of CCE's North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. We estimate that approximately 35 percent of our total cost of goods in 2011 will be comprised of both the raw material and conversion costs associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The bulk of these costs will reside within our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure; and therefore, we have increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to the heading \"Gross Profit Margin,\" below, and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity. \n\nThe acquisition of CCE's North American business increased the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010, primarily due to delivery-related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are typically higher, as a percentage of net operating revenues, for finished products operations compared to concentrate operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition. The Company recorded $605 million of definite-lived acquired franchise rights that are being amortized over a weighted-average life of approximately 8 years, which is equal to the weighted-average remaining contractual term of the acquired franchise rights. In addition, the Company recorded $380 million of customer rights that are being amortized over 20 years. We estimate the amortization expense related to these definite-lived intangible assets to be approximately $100 million per year for the next several years, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nOnce fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate realizing approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Refer to the heading \"Other Operating Charges,\" below, and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this integration initiative. \n\nIn connection with the Company's acquisition of CCE's North American business, we assumed $7,602 million of long-term debt, which had an estimated fair value of $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOn November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long-term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long-term debt. The Company used the remaining cash from the issuance to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The repurchased debt consisted of $1,827 million of debt assumed in our acquisition of CCE's North American business and $1,083 million of the Company's debt that was outstanding prior to the acquisition. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to the heading \"Interest Expense,\" below, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn 2010, we recognized a gain of $4,978 million due to the remeasurement of our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon the close of the transaction. This gain was classified in the line item other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nAlthough our 2010 operating results and certain key metrics were affected by these structural changes, we do not believe it is indicative of the impact they will have on future operating periods. Our 2011 consolidated financial statements will reflect twelve months of operating results of the acquired CCE North American business and DPS license agreements compared to three months in 2010. Therefore, we expect these structural changes to have a significant impact on our operating results and certain key metrics in 2011, when compared to 2010. \n\nPrior to the closing of this acquisition, we had accounted for our investment in CCE under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded our proportionate share of CCE's net income or loss \n\nin the line item equity income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statements of income. However, as a result of this transaction, beginning October 2, 2010, the Company no longer records equity income or loss related to CCE; and therefore, we expect this transaction to negatively impact equity income in future periods. Refer to the heading \"Equity Income (Loss) &#151; Net,\" below. \n\nDivestiture of Norwegian and Swedish Bottling Operations \n\nThe divestiture of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations had no impact on our consolidated unit case volume and consolidated concentrate sales volume, for the same reasons discussed above in relation to our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The divestiture of these bottling operations reduced unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment. In addition, the divestiture reduced net operating revenues and net income for our consolidated operating results and the Bottling Investments operating segment. However, since we divested a finished goods business, it had a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating margins. Furthermore, the impact these divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues was partially offset by the concentrate revenues that were recognized on sales to these bottling operations. These concentrate sales had previously been eliminated because they were intercompany transactions. The net impact to net operating revenues was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" below. \n\nThis divestiture resulted in a gain of $597 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nImpact of New Accounting Guidance \n\nBeginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Principles of Consolidation,\" above. The entities that have been deconsolidated as a result of this change in accounting guidance accounted for approximately 3 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues and less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company in 2009. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Principles of Consolidation,\" above. These entities accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Company's equity income in 2010. Refer to the heading \"Equity Income (Loss) &#151; Net,\" below. The impact that the deconsolidation of these entities had on net operating revenues was included as a structural change. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" below. \n\nBeverage Volume \n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures, in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. \n\nInformation about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 vs. 2009 &#160; &#160; 2009 vs. 2008 &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; Unit Cases 1,2 &#160; Concentrate Sales &#160; &#160; Unit Cases 1,2 &#160; Concentrate Sales &#160; &#160; &#160; Worldwide &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; 5 % &#160; 3 % &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; 12 % &#160; 4 % &#160; 5 % Europe &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; (2 ) Latin America &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; (2 ) &#160; (2 ) Pacific &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; N/A &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; N/A &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. &#160; 2 Geographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers in the applicable geographic areas, both consolidated and unconsolidated. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nUnit Case Volume \n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold approximately 25.5 billion unit cases of our products in 2010, approximately 24.4 billion unit cases in 2009 and approximately 23.7 billion unit cases in 2008. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nIn Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 12 percent, which consisted of 10 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 21 percent growth in still beverages. The group's unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 17 percent growth in India, which included growth of 15 percent and 23 percent in sparkling and still beverages, respectively. India's growth in sparkling beverages was led by double-digit growth in Trademarks Sprite, Thums Up and Coca-Cola, which reflected the benefit of successful national marketing programs. Still beverage growth in India included the impact of 22 percent growth in our Maaza juice brand. In addition to growth in India, the group's unit case volume growth included 14 percent growth in Turkey, 8 percent growth in North and West Africa, 16 percent growth in Russia, 20 percent growth in Southern Eurasia, 12 percent growth in East and Central Africa and 5 percent growth in South Africa. The growth across the African continent was attributable to the strong performance of both sparkling and still beverages and the benefit of our FIFA World Cup&#153; activation programs. \n\nUnit case volume in Europe was even, which reflected the impact of continuing difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout certain regions in Europe. The group's unit case volume included unit case volume growth of 5 percent in France, 1 percent in Germany and 2 percent in our Nordic Business Unit. The growth in these regions was offset by unit case volume declines in other regions, including a 7 percent decline in South and Eastern Europe, primarily due to continuing macroeconomic pressures. The group's unit case volume also included unit case volume declines of 2 percent and 1 percent in Italy and Iberia, respectively. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 9 percent growth in still beverages. The group's unit case volume growth was led by 11 percent growth in Brazil and 3 percent growth in Mexico. Brazil's unit case volume growth was primarily due to 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages, led by 11 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. Mexico's unit case volume growth was impacted by adverse weather conditions. The group's unit case volume growth also included 5 percent growth in our South Latin Business Unit. All of the aforementioned markets benefited from our strong FIFA World Cup&#153; activation programs. \n\nUnit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, including 1 percent attributable to the new license agreements with DPS. The group's unit case volume growth was driven by 5 percent growth in still beverages, led by 19 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, 12 percent growth in teas and 23 percent growth in Trademark Simply. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages in North America increased 1 percent, primarily due to the sale of DPS brands under the new license agreements. Coca-Cola Zero continued its strong performance in North America with 15 percent \n\ngrowth in 2010. The group's strong marketing initiatives, including our FIFA World Cup&#153; activation programs, contributed to the unit case volume growth in North America. \n\nThe volume and net operating revenues attributable to the sale of DPS brands have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" below, and \"Structural Changes and New License Agreements,\" above. \n\nIn Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 13 percent growth in still beverages and 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The group's volume growth was led by 6 percent growth in China, 15 percent growth in the Philippines and 3 percent growth in Japan. China's volume growth included 21 percent growth in juices and juice drinks primarily due to the continued strong momentum of Minute Maid Pulpy, as well as strong growth in other still beverages including water. Tough weather conditions, including flooding in the higher per capita consumption regions, negatively impacted unit case volume in China. In the Philippines, unit case volume growth was led by 14 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. In Japan, the unit case volume growth was driven by successful in-market activations, strong innovation and favorable weather conditions. Included in Japan's unit case volume growth was 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, primarily due to strong FIFA World Cup&#153; activation programs and our Coca-Cola Summer Promotion. Japan's unit case volume growth also benefited from 17 percent growth in sports drinks. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Principles of Consolidation\" and \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements.\" The deconsolidation of these entities negatively impacted the unit case volume for Bottling Investments by approximately 9 percent. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments was also negatively impacted by the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. The unfavorable impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by growth in markets where we own or otherwise consolidate the bottling operations. Unit case volume grew 6 percent in China, 17 percent in India, 15 percent in the Philippines and 1 percent in Germany. The Company's consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 66 percent, 100 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India, the Philippines and Germany, respectively. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nIn Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 4 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 8 percent growth in still beverages. The group's unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 31 percent growth in India, led by 32 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The sparkling beverages growth in India was largely due to double-digit growth in Trademarks Thums Up, Sprite, Fanta and Coca-Cola. Still beverages in India grew 28 percent, driven by double-digit growth in Trademark Maaza. The group also benefited from 6 percent volume growth in North and West Africa and 10 percent volume growth in East and Central Africa. The group's unit case volume growth also included the impact of a 14 percent volume decline in Russia, primarily due to a challenging economic environment. In addition, South Africa and Turkey each experienced a 1 percent unit case volume decline. \n\nUnit case volume in Europe decreased 1 percent, primarily attributable to difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout most of Europe. These difficult macroeconomic conditions impacted a number of key markets and contributed to unit case volume declines of 8 percent in South and Eastern Europe, 4 percent in Iberia and 2 percent in Germany. The volume declines in these markets were partially offset by 6 percent unit case volume growth in France and 4 percent growth in Great Britain. The unit case volume growth in both France and Great Britain was led by Trademark Coca-Cola. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 24 percent growth in still beverages. The group benefited from strong volume growth in key markets, including 6 percent in Mexico, 4 percent in Brazil, 2 percent in Argentina and double-digit growth in Colombia. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point of the group's total unit case volume growth. The group's sparkling beverage volume growth was primarily attributable to 4 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola. The successful integration of Jugos del Valle, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Jugos del Valle\") drove still beverage volume growth. \n\nUnit case volume in North America decreased 2 percent, which reflected the impact of a difficult U.S. economic environment and a competitive pricing environment. The effect of the economic environment and pricing environment was partially offset by the impact of strong customer and consumer programs. North America's unit case volume decline consisted of a 3 percent decline in sparkling beverages, partially offset by 1 percent growth in still beverages. The decline in sparkling beverages was partly attributable to the significant price increase taken by bottlers in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline was partially offset by the continued strong performance of Coca-Cola Zero, which had unit case volume growth of 19 percent. Still beverage unit case volume growth was primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze Beverage, LLC (\"Fuze\"), Trademark Simply and tea. The unit case volume growth in still beverages was reduced by a double-digit volume decline in the North American water businesses, including Trademark Dasani, primarily due to the slowing water category and the Company's decision to not pursue unprofitable volume opportunities in bulk water/case packs in North America. \n\nIn Pacific, unit case volume increased 7 percent, which consisted of growth in sparkling and still beverages of 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Sparkling beverage growth in Pacific included 14 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. The group's volume growth was led by 16 percent growth in China, which reflected 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 30 percent growth in still beverages. China's sparkling beverage volume growth was led by double-digit growth in Trademark Sprite and 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. China's still beverage volume growth was led by double-digit growth in Minute Maid. The unit case volume growth in China was partially offset by a 2 percent volume decline in Japan, primarily due to the continued severe economic challenges and unfavorable weather conditions during what are traditionally high-volume months. Sparkling beverage volume in Japan was even, while still beverages declined 3 percent. The decline in still beverages included the impact of a 5 percent volume decline in Aquarius and a 3 percent decline in Georgia Coffee. Due to the weak economy, Georgia Coffee was negatively impacted by shifts away from the at-work vending channel. The group's volume increase also included a 1 percent increase in the Philippines. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 2 percent, primarily due to the impact of unit case volume growth of 16 percent in China, 31 percent in India and 1 percent in the Philippines. The Company's consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 65 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and the Philippines, respectively. The favorable impact of unit case volume in these markets was partially offset by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda. (\"Remil\"), a bottler in Brazil, and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd. (\"Coca-Cola Pakistan\"), which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Germany's unit case volume declined 2 percent. The Company's consolidated bottling operations account for 100 percent of the unit case volume in Germany. \n\nConcentrate Sales Volume \n\nIn 2010, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2009. In 2009, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 3 percent compared to 2008. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for individual operating segments in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. \n\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2010 vs. 2009 &#160; 2009 vs. 2008 &#160; (In millions except percentages and per share data) &#160; NET OPERATING REVENUES &#160; $ &#160; 35,119 &#160; $ 30,990 &#160; $ 31,944 &#160; 13 % (3 )% Cost of goods sold &#160; 12,693 &#160; 11,088 &#160; 11,374 &#160; 14 &#160; (3 ) &#160; &#160; GROSS PROFIT &#160; 22,426 &#160; 19,902 &#160; 20,570 &#160; 13 &#160; (3 ) GROSS PROFIT MARGIN &#160; 63.9 % 64.2 % 64.4 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Selling, general and administrative expenses &#160; 13,158 &#160; 11,358 &#160; 11,774 &#160; 16 &#160; (4 ) Other operating charges &#160; 819 &#160; 313 &#160; 350 &#160; * &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; OPERATING INCOME &#160; 8,449 &#160; 8,231 &#160; 8,446 &#160; 3 &#160; (3 ) OPERATING MARGIN &#160; 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest income &#160; 317 &#160; 249 &#160; 333 &#160; 27 &#160; (25 ) Interest expense &#160; 733 &#160; 355 &#160; 438 &#160; 106 &#160; (19 ) Equity income (loss) &#151; net &#160; 1,025 &#160; 781 &#160; (874 ) 31 &#160; * &#160; Other income (loss) &#151; net &#160; 5,185 &#160; 40 &#160; 39 &#160; * &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES &#160; 14,243 &#160; 8,946 &#160; 7,506 &#160; 59 &#160; 19 &#160; Income taxes &#160; 2,384 &#160; 2,040 &#160; 1,632 &#160; 17 &#160; 25 &#160; Effective tax rate &#160; 16.7 % 22.8 % 21.7 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME &#160; 11,859 &#160; 6,906 &#160; 5,874 &#160; 72 &#160; 18 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests &#160; 50 &#160; 82 &#160; 67 &#160; (39 ) 22 &#160; &#160; &#160; NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREOWNERS OF THE COCA-COLA COMPANY &#160; $ &#160; 11,809 &#160; $ 6,824 &#160; $ 5,807 &#160; 73 % 18 % &#160; &#160; NET INCOME PER SHARE 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Basic net income per share &#160; $ &#160; 5.12 &#160; $ 2.95 &#160; $ 2.51 &#160; 74 % 18 % Diluted net income per share &#160; $ &#160; 5.06 &#160; $ 2.93 &#160; $ 2.49 &#160; 73 % 18 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * Calculation is not meaningful. &#160; 1 Basic net income per share and diluted net income per share are calculated based on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Operating Revenues \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nNet operating revenues increased by $4,129 million, or 13 percent.

Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#149; consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; &#149; Eurasia and Africa was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as India and Russia. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; &#149; Latin America was favorably impacted by pricing in a number of our key markets and the impact of still beverages growing faster than sparkling beverages; &#149; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and the Philippines. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets. 59 \n\nThe favorable impact of currency fluctuations increased net operating revenues by approximately 2 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#151; Foreign Exchange.\" \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nNet operating revenues decreased by $954 million, or 3 percent. The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues by operating segment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Percent Change 2009 vs. 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Volume 1 Structural changes &#160; Price, product &#38; geographic mix &#160; Currency fluctuations &#160; Total &#160; &#160; &#160; Consolidated &#160; 3 % (1 )% &#160;&#151; % (5 )% (3 )% &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; 5 % &#160;&#151; % &#160;&#151; % (11 )% (6 )% Europe &#160; (2 ) &#151; &#160; 1 &#160; (9 ) (10 ) Latin America &#160; 7 &#160; &#151; &#160; 9 &#160; (15 ) 1 &#160; North America &#160; (2 ) &#151; &#160; 2 &#160; &#151; &#160; &#151; &#160; Pacific &#160; 7 &#160; (1 ) (7 ) 5 &#160; 4 &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; 2 &#160; (4 ) 1 &#160; (6 ) (7 ) Corporate &#160; * &#160; * &#160; * &#160; * &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * Calculation is not meaningful. &#160; 1 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases). For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" above. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRefer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. \n\nStructural changes accounted for approximately 1 percent of the decrease in net operating revenues. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Other Income (Loss) &#151; Net\" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrice, product and geographic mix had a net zero percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#149; consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies. The shift in our marketing and media spend strategies was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in-store activations, loyalty points programs and point-of-sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading \"Selling, General and Administrative Expenses,\" below; &#149; consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; &#149; Latin America benefited from the successful integration of Jugos del Valle. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" above; 60 \n\n&#149; North America was favorably impacted by the growth of our still beverage volume, primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze, Trademark Simply and tea. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" above; &#149; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and a decline in Japan, a developed market. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume,\" above. The revenue per unit sold in emerging and developing markets is generally less than in developed markets. The Pacific operating segment was also unfavorably impacted by shifts away from the at-work vending channel in our Japanese business. The unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations decreased net operating revenues by approximately 5 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#151; Foreign Exchange.\" \n\nNet Operating Revenues by Operating Segment \n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; &#160; 6.9 % &#160; 6.4 % &#160; 6.7 % Europe &#160; &#160; 12.6 &#160; &#160; 13.9 &#160; &#160; 15.0 &#160; Latin America &#160; &#160; 11.0 &#160; &#160; 12.0 &#160; &#160; 11.3 &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 31.7 &#160; &#160; 26.4 &#160; &#160; 25.7 &#160; Pacific &#160; &#160; 14.1 &#160; &#160; 14.6 &#160; &#160; 13.7 &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; &#160; 23.4 &#160; &#160; 26.4 &#160; &#160; 27.3 &#160; Corporate &#160; &#160; 0.3 &#160; &#160; 0.3 &#160; &#160; 0.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to the other operating segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations. In 2010, the percentage of the Company's net operating revenues contributed by our North America operating segment increased by 5.3 percent, primarily due to our acquisition of CCE's North American business and sales related to our new license agreements with DPS. In 2011, we expect the percentage contribution by our North America operating segment to increase from 2010 due to the full year impact of these structural items. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the first quarter of operation following our acquisition of CCE's North American business and the new license agreements with DPS, our North America operating segment contributed 45.8 percent of the Company's net operating revenues. Although the fourth quarter of 2010 may not be indicative of the full year 2011 percentage contribution, it provides trend information related to the potential future impact of these structural changes. \n\nIn addition, in 2010, the percentage of the Company's net operating revenues contributed by our Bottling Investments operating segment decreased by 3.0 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above. \n\nThe size and timing of structural changes are not consistent from period to period. As a result, anticipating the impact of such events on future net operating revenues, and other financial statement line items, usually is not possible. We expect structural changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. \n\nGross Profit Margin \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 63.9 percent from 64.2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, partially offset by favorable geographic mix, product mix, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. \n\nRefer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above, for additional information regarding the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" above. \n\nIn 2011, we expect our gross profit margin to decline due to the full year impact of consolidating CCE's North American business, as well as an increase in commodity costs. The acquisition of CCE's North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. Finished products operations typically have lower gross profit margins and the additional commodity risk could lead to higher raw material costs in 2011. Subsequent to this transaction, approximately 35 percent of our consolidated cost of goods sold is comprised of the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The majority of these costs are incurred by our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate that the cost of underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure. We expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity costs on our total company results to range between $300 million and $400 million. \n\nUpon the close of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, we increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 64.2 percent in 2009 from 64.4 percent in 2008, primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations, the growth of our finished products operations, unfavorable geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets, our current focus to drive greater affordability initiatives across many key markets, and unfavorable channel and product mix in certain key markets. The unfavorable impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the favorable impact of price increases in certain markets, lower costs related to several key commodities and the sale of certain bottling operations in 2008. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading \"Other Income (Loss) &#151; Net,\" below, and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Stock-based compensation expense &#160; &#160; $ &#160; 380 &#160; &#160; $ 241 &#160; &#160; $ 266 &#160; Advertising expenses &#160; &#160; 2,917 &#160; &#160; 2,791 &#160; &#160; 2,998 &#160; Bottling and distribution expenses &#160; &#160; 3,902 &#160; &#160; 2,627 &#160; &#160; 2,815 &#160; Other operating expenses &#160; &#160; 5,959 &#160; &#160; 5,699 &#160; &#160; 5,695 &#160; &#160; &#160; Selling, general and administrative expenses &#160; &#160; $ 13,158 &#160; &#160; $ 11,358 &#160; &#160; $ 11,774 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,800 million, or 16 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percent. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily related to higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long-term incentive compensation programs and the impact of modifications made to certain replacement performance share unit awards issued by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The Company modified primarily all of these replacement performance share unit awards to eliminate the remaining holding period, which resulted in approximately $74 million of accelerated expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in advertising expenses reflected the Company's continued investment in our brands and building market execution capabilities. \n\nThe increase in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily related to the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business and our continued investments in our other bottling operations. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and accounted for approximately 2 percent of the Company's consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009. Bottling and distribution expenses were also reduced due to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. \n\nIn 2011, our pension expense is expected to increase by approximately $60 million compared to 2010. The anticipated increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business and a decrease in our discount rate compared to 2010. The expected unfavorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the expected favorable impact of approximately $800 million of anticipated contributions to various plans in 2011, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the anticipated 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\" for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Pension Plan Valuations,\" and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the discount rates used by the Company. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, we had $457 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $416 million, or 4 percent. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 4 percent. Advertising expenses were impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies, primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in-store activations, loyalty points programs and point-of-sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net operating revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" above. The decrease in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily attributable to the full year impact of certain bottling operations sold in 2008. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a \n\nportion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Other operating expenses reflects the impact of an increase in pension costs and higher short-term incentive costs, partially offset by savings generated from the Company's ongoing productivity initiatives. The increase in our pension expense was primarily attributable to the significant decline in the value of our pension plan assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system instability in 2008. As a result of this decline, along with a decrease in the discount rate, our 2009 pension costs increased by $103 million. \n\nOther Operating Charges \n\nOther operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; &#160; $ 7 &#160; &#160; $ 4 &#160; &#160; $ 1 &#160; Europe &#160; &#160; 50 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Latin America &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 133 &#160; &#160; 31 &#160; &#160; 56 &#160; Pacific &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; &#160; 122 &#160; &#160; 141 &#160; &#160; 46 &#160; Corporate &#160; &#160; 485 &#160; &#160; 129 &#160; &#160; 246 &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; $ 819 &#160; &#160; $ 313 &#160; &#160; $ 350 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2010, the Company incurred other operating charges of approximately $819 million, which consisted of $478 million associated with the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, $250 million related to charitable contributions, $81 million due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and $10 million of charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. The Company's integration activities include costs associated with the integration of CCE's North American business, as well as the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The charitable contributions were primarily attributable to a cash donation to The Coca-Cola Foundation. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction costs. \n\nIn 2010, the Company began an integration initiative related to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, which resulted in total expenses of $135 million. These expenses were primarily related to both internal and external costs associated with the development and design of our future operating framework. These charges impacted the North America and Corporate operating segments. Our acquisition of CCE's North American business closed on October 2, 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. We are reconfiguring our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to achieve cost reductions over time. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate that these operational synergies will be phased in over the next four years, and that we will begin to fully realize the annual benefit from these synergies in the fourth year. We currently expect to realize approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. \n\nUpon completion of the CCE transaction, we combined the management of the acquired North American business with the management of our existing foodservice business, Minute Maid and Odwalla juice businesses, North America supply chain operations and Company-owned bottling operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a unified bottling and customer service organization called CCR. In addition, we reshaped our remaining CCNA operations into an organization that primarily provides franchise leadership and consumer marketing and innovation for the North American market. As a result of the transaction and related reorganization, our North American businesses operate as aligned and agile organizations with distinct capabilities, responsibilities and strengths. The Company currently expects the total cost of these integration initiatives to be approximately $425 million and anticipates recognizing these charges over the next three years. \n\nThe Company's integration initiatives include costs related to the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The Company began these integration initiatives in 2008 and has incurred total pretax expenses of approximately $225 million since they commenced. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company is currently reviewing other integration and restructuring opportunities within the German bottling and distribution operations, which if implemented will result in additional charges in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2010, the Company had not finalized any additional plans. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this integration initiative. \n\nThe Company has recognized costs of approximately $352 million related to our ongoing productivity initiatives since they commenced in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is targeting $500 million in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by the end of 2011 to provide additional flexibility to invest for growth. The savings are expected to be generated in a number of areas and include aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a \"procure-to-pay\" program. In realizing these savings, the Company expects to incur total costs of approximately $500 million by the end of 2011. The Company believes we are on track to achieve our $500 million target in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's ongoing productivity initiatives. \n\nIn 2009, the Company incurred other operating charges of $313 million, which consisted of $273 million related to the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives and $40 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. The impairment charges were related to a $23 million impairment of an intangible asset and a $17 million impairment of a building. The impairment of the intangible asset was due to a change in the expected useful life of the asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. The $17 million impairment was due to a change in disposal strategy related to a building that is no longer occupied. The Company had originally intended to sell the building along with the related land. However, we have determined that the maximum potential sales proceeds would likely be realized through the sale of vacant land. As a result, the building was removed. The land is not considered held-for-sale, primarily due to the fact that it is not probable a sale would be completed within one year. \n\nIn 2008, the Company incurred other operating charges of $350 million, which consisted of $249 million due to productivity and restructuring initiatives, $63 million related to contract termination fees and $38 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity and restructuring initiatives. The contract termination fees were primarily the result of penalties incurred by the Company to terminate existing supply and co-packer agreements. The asset impairment charges were primarily due to the write-down of manufacturing lines that produced product packaging materials. \n\nOperating Income and Operating Margin \n\nInformation about our operating income contribution by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; &#160; 11.6 % &#160; 9.8 % &#160; 9.9 % Europe &#160; &#160; 35.2 &#160; &#160; 35.8 &#160; &#160; 37.6 &#160; Latin America &#160; &#160; 28.5 &#160; &#160; 24.8 &#160; &#160; 24.8 &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 18.0 &#160; &#160; 20.7 &#160; &#160; 18.8 &#160; Pacific &#160; &#160; 24.2 &#160; &#160; 22.9 &#160; &#160; 22.0 &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; &#160; 2.7 &#160; &#160; 2.2 &#160; &#160; 3.1 &#160; Corporate &#160; &#160; (20.2 ) &#160; (16.2 ) &#160; (16.2 ) &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; Information about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment is as follows: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Consolidated &#160; &#160; 24.1 % &#160; 26.6 % &#160; 26.4 % &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; &#160; 40.4 % &#160; 41.0 % &#160; 39.1 % Europe &#160; &#160; 67.3 &#160; &#160; 68.4 &#160; &#160; 66.4 &#160; Latin America &#160; &#160; 62.0 &#160; &#160; 55.2 &#160; &#160; 57.9 &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 13.6 &#160; &#160; 20.7 &#160; &#160; 19.3 &#160; Pacific &#160; &#160; 41.4 &#160; &#160; 41.6 &#160; &#160; 42.6 &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; &#160; 2.8 &#160; &#160; 2.2 &#160; &#160; 3.0 &#160; Corporate &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * Calculation is not meaningful. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by operating segment fluctuated from year to year. Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events including the following: \n\n&#149; In 2010, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 3 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#151; Foreign Exchange.\" &#149; In 2010, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 7 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 3 percent for Latin America, 8 percent for Pacific and 9 percent for Bottling Investments. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 1 percent for Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a nominal impact on operating income for North America and Corporate. &#149; In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. 66 \n\n&#149; In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. The majority of the deconsolidated entities had previously been included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. &#149; In 2010, the operating margin for the Latin America operating segment was favorably impacted by the sale of 50 percent of our ownership interest in Le&#227;o Junior resulting in its deconsolidation, as well as the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Price and product mix also favorably impacted Latin America's operating income and operating margin during the year. &#149; In 2010, the operating margin for the North America operating segment was unfavorably impacted by the Company's acquisition of CCE's North American business. Generally, bottling and finished products operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above. &#149; In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $74 million due to the acceleration of expense associated with certain share-based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#149; In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the profit associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the profit associated with concentrate sold to CCE's legacy North American business until the finished beverage products made from those concentrates are sold. &#149; In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $20 million due to the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. &#149; In 2010, operating income was reduced by $7 million for Eurasia and Africa, $50 million for Europe, $133 million for North America, $22 million for Pacific, $122 million for Bottling Investments and $485 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. Refer to the heading \"Other Operating Charges,\" above. &#149; In 2009, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 11 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#151; Foreign Exchange.\" &#149; In 2009, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 15 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 11 percent for Europe, 18 percent for Latin America, 1 percent for North America, 19 percent for Bottling Investments and 4 percent for Corporate. Operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 3 percent for Pacific. 67 \n\n&#149; In 2009, shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies favorably impacted the operating margin in the majority of our operating segments. The shift was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in-store activations, improving shelf impact, loyalty points programs and point-of-sale marketing. Many of these strategies are recorded as deductions from revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" above. &#149; In 2009, lower commodity prices favorably impacted North America's operating margin. &#149; In 2009, the operating margins for the Latin America and North America operating segments were unfavorably impacted by the growth of our finished goods businesses. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. &#149; In 2009, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. &#149; In 2009, operating income was reduced by approximately $4 million for Eurasia and Africa, $7 million for Europe, $31 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $141 million for Bottling Investments and $129 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, the Company's ongoing productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading \"Other Operating Charges,\" above. &#149; In 2008, operating income was reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for Latin America, $56 million for North America, $46 million for Bottling Investments and $246 million for Corporate, primarily due to restructuring costs, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading \"Other Operating Charges,\" above. Interest Income \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nInterest income increased by $68 million, or 27 percent. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average cash and short-term investment balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nInterest income decreased by $84 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher short-term investment balances. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nInterest expense increased $378 million, primarily due to a $342 million charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. The increase also reflects the impact of interest expense on debt assumed from CCE. In connection with the Company's acquisition of CCE's North American business, we assumed $266 million of short-term borrowings and $7,602 million of long-term debt. The estimated fair value of the long-term debt was approximately $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long-term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long-term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included approximately $994 million of fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from CCE. These fair value adjustments will be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 15 years, which is equal to the weighted-average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $422 million in 2010. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nInterest expense decreased by $83 million, or 19 percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on short-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2009. The Company elected to replace a certain amount of commercial paper and short-term debt with longer-term debt, which resulted in the Company issuing long-term notes in the principal amounts of $900 million at a rate of 3.625 percent and $1,350 million at a rate of 4.875 percent due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The interest rates on the long-term notes are higher than the interest rates on our short-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn addition, interest expense in 2008 included the impact of the reclassification of approximately $17 million of previously unrecognized gains on interest rate locks from AOCI to interest expense, which was partially offset by approximately $9 million of losses related to the portion of cash flow hedges that were deemed to be ineffective. The reclassification was the result of a discontinued cash flow hedging relationship on interest rate locks, as it was no longer probable that we would issue the long-term debt for which these hedges were designated. \n\nEquity Income (Loss) &#151; Net \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 \n\nEquity income (loss) &#151; net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investments. In 2010, equity income was $1,025 million, compared to equity income of $781 million in 2009, an increase of $244 million, or 31 percent. The increase was primarily due to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees; the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; a decrease in the Company's proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees; and the impact of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact of these items was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, which resulted in the consolidation of CCE's North American business. As a result of this transaction, the Company stopped recording equity income related to CCE beginning October 2, 2010. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above. \n\nThe Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB resulted in the deconsolidation of certain entities. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Company's equity income in 2010. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 \n\nIn 2009, equity income was $781 million, compared to an equity loss of $874 million in 2008, an increase of $1,655 million. In 2008, equity income (loss) &#151; net was impacted by our proportionate share of approximately $7.6 billion of pretax charges ($4.9 billion after-tax) recorded by CCE due to impairments of its North American franchise rights. The Company's proportionate share of these charges was approximately $1.6 billion. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets,\" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in equity income in 2009 was also partially attributable to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the Company's proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees. \n\nOther Income (Loss) &#151; Net \n\nOther income (loss) &#151; net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, dividend income, rental income, gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities and the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets \n\nand liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2010, other income (loss) &#151; net was income of $5,185 million, primarily related to a $4,978 million gain related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon the close of our acquisition of CCE's North American business and a $597 million gain related to the sale of all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These gains were partially offset by a $265 million charge related to preexisting relationships with CCE and foreign currency exchange losses of $148 million. The charge related to preexisting relationships was primarily due to the write-off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. The foreign currency exchange losses were primarily due to a charge of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#151; Foreign Exchange.\" In addition to the items mentioned above, other income (loss) &#151; net also included a $23 million gain on the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&#227;o Junior and $48 million of charges related to other-than-temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity investees. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2009, other income (loss) &#151; net was income of $40 million, primarily related to a realized gain of approximately $44 million on the sale of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, $40 million from the sale of other investments and $18 million of dividend income from cost method investments. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the gain on the sale of available-for-sale securities. These gains were partially offset by approximately $34 million in net foreign currency exchange losses and an other-than-temporary impairment charge of approximately $27 million on a cost method investment. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Investments in Equity and Debt Securities,\" and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2008, other income (loss) &#151; net was income of $39 million. The Company recognized gains on divestitures of approximately $119 million, primarily related to the sale of Remil to Coca-Cola FEMSA and the sale of a portion of the Company's investment in Coca-Cola Pakistan to Coca-Cola Icecek A.S. (\"Coca-Cola Icecek\"). Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) &#151; net also included approximately $24 million in net foreign currency exchange gains in 2008. The gains on divestitures and net foreign currency exchange were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment charges of approximately $81 million on available-for-sale securities. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#151; Investments in Equity and Debt Securities,\" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) &#151; net also included approximately $46 million of realized and unrealized losses on trading securities. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. A change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the Company's periodic effective tax rate. \n\nOur effective tax rate of approximately 16.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the following: \n\n&#149; an approximate 27 percent combined effective tax rate on the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a tax benefit of $34 million related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The tax benefit reflects the impact of reversing deferred tax liabilities associated with our equity investment in CCE prior to the acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 37 percent effective tax rate on charges related to preexisting relationships with CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 70 \n\n&#149; an approximate 44 percent effective tax rate on the gain related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 35 percent combined effective tax rate on the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCE's North American business (refer to the heading \"Gross Profit Margin,\" above); &#149; an approximate 37 percent combined effective tax rate on the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition and mark-to-market gains related to non-designated hedges that are associated with underlying transactions expected to occur in a future period; &#149; an approximate 38 percent effective tax rate on the acceleration of expense associated with certain share-based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business (refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 4 percent combined effective tax rate on other-than-temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 33 percent combined effective tax rate on a charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer (refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a zero percent effective tax rate on the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 46 percent effective tax rate on the gain from the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&#227;o Junior (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 14 percent effective tax rate on our proportionate share of unusual tax charges, asset impairments, restructuring charges, transaction costs and a remeasurement gain recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a tax charge of approximately $14 million related to new legislation that changed the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies (refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a net tax charge of approximately $216 million, primarily related to deferred tax expense on certain current year undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and &#149; a net tax charge of approximately $67 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 22.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, included the following: \n\n&#149; an approximate 17 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, productivity initiatives and asset impairments (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 21 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a zero percent effective tax rate on an other-than-temporary impairment of a cost method investment (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a zero percent effective tax rate on realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities (refer to Note 3 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a tax benefit of approximately $17 million due to the impact that a tax rate change had on certain deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 71 \n\n&#149; a tax charge of approximately $15 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and &#149; a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 21.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2008, included the following: \n\n&#149; an approximate 20 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments recorded by the Company (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 23 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees, primarily related to impairment charges recorded by CCE (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; an approximate 24 percent combined effective tax rate on gains from divestitures (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); &#149; a tax charge of approximately $10 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and &#149; a net tax benefit of approximately $5 million, primarily related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2010, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $387 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate of approximately $163 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining approximately $224 million, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event that the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefit amounts is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits &#160; &#160; $ 354 &#160; &#160; $ 369 &#160; &#160; $ 643 &#160; Increases related to prior period tax positions &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; 52 &#160; Decreases related to prior period tax positions &#160; &#160; (10 ) &#160; (28 ) &#160; (4 ) Increases due to current period tax positions &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; 47 &#160; Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; (27 ) &#160; (254 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; (73 ) &#160; (36 ) Increase due to acquisition of CCE's North American business &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Increases (decreases) from effects of exchange rates &#160; &#160; (21 ) &#160; 48 &#160; &#160; (79 ) &#160; &#160; Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits &#160; &#160; $ 387 &#160; &#160; $ 354 &#160; &#160; $ 369 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2008, agreements were reached between the U.S. government and a foreign government concerning the allocation of income between the two tax jurisdictions. Pursuant to these agreements, we made cash payments during the third quarter of 2008 that constituted payments of tax and interest. These payments were partially offset by tax credits taken in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008, and tax refunds and interest on refunds received in 2009. These benefits had been recorded as deferred tax assets in prior periods. The settlements did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2008. \n\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had approximately $112 million, $94 million and $110 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $17 million, $16 million and $14 million of benefits were recognized through tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate. \n\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2011 is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in future years. \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position \n\nWe believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2011. As a result of our expected strong cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. We typically fund a significant portion of our dividends, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, share repurchases and acquisitions with cash generated from operating activities. We rely on external funding for additional cash requirements. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities,\" below. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, we acquired CCE's North American business. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCE's North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Company's 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCE's North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as \"New CCE\") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. \n\nAlthough the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. \n\nOn November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long-term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long-term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt. \n\nIn a concurrent transaction, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash on October 2, 2010. The Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company prior to the divestiture. This divestiture was pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement entered into on March 20, 2010. In addition, we granted New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in CCEAG, 18 to 39 months after the date of the merger agreement, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. \n\nIn contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C' Plus in Canada, and we made a net one-time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20-year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca-Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. \n\nThe Company contributed $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2011, we expect to contribute $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe government in Venezuela has enacted certain monetary policies that restrict the ability of companies to pay dividends from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2010, cash held by our Venezuelan subsidiary accounted for approximately 2 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance. In the first quarter of 2010 the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of $103 million during the first quarter of 2010 in the line item other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government-approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. \n\nIn addition to the Company's cash balances and commercial paper program, we also maintain $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. We have evaluated the financial stability of each bank and believe we can access the funds, if needed. \n\nBased on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9,532 million, $8,186 million and $7,571 million, respectively. \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $1,346 million, or 16 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to increased receipts from customers, the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business, the favorable impact of exchange rates on operations and a decrease in contributions to our pension plans. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher tax payments in 2010. The increase in cash receipts from customers was primarily due to an increase in net operating revenues. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues,\" above. Also, in 2009, cash flows from operating activities included the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca-Cola Hellenic. The Company contributed approximately $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $269 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $615 million, or 8 percent, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to lower tax payments, decreased payments to suppliers and vendors, and the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca-Cola Hellenic. The special dividend received from Coca-Cola Hellenic was incremental to its normal quarterly dividend. We classified the receipt of this special dividend in cash flows from operating activities due to the fact that our cumulative equity in earnings from Coca-Cola Hellenic exceeded the cumulative distributions received; therefore, the special dividend was deemed to be a return on our investment and not a return of our investment. The impact of these items was partially offset by increased contributions to our pension plans. The increase in contributions to our pension plans was primarily due to the decline in fair value of our pension \n\nplan assets in 2008. The Company contributed approximately $269 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to approximately $96 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Purchases of short-term investments &#160; &#160; $ (4,579 ) &#160; $ (2,130 ) &#160; $ &#151; &#160; Proceeds from disposals of short-term investments &#160; &#160; 4,032 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Acquisitions and investments &#160; &#160; (2,511 ) &#160; (300 ) &#160; (759 ) Purchases of other investments &#160; &#160; (132 ) &#160; (22 ) &#160; (240 ) Proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments &#160; &#160; 972 &#160; &#160; 240 &#160; &#160; 479 &#160; Purchases of property, plant and equipment &#160; &#160; (2,215 ) &#160; (1,993 ) &#160; (1,968 ) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment &#160; &#160; 134 &#160; &#160; 104 &#160; &#160; 129 &#160; Other investing activities &#160; &#160; (106 ) &#160; (48 ) &#160; (4 ) &#160; &#160; Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities &#160; &#160; $ (4,405 ) &#160; $ (4,149 ) &#160; $ &#160; (2,363 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nShort-term Investments \n\nIn 2010, purchases of short-term investments were $4,579 million, and proceeds from disposals of short-term investments were $4,032 million. This activity resulted in a net cash outflow of $547 million during the year. In 2009, purchases of short-term investments were $2,130 million. These short-term investments are time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year, and are classified in the line item short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company began investing in longer-term time deposits during the fourth quarter of 2009 to match the maturities of short-term debt issued as part of our commercial paper program. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities,\" below. These time deposits are classified in the line item short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nAcquisitions and Investments \n\nIn 2010, the Company's acquisition and investment activities totaled $2,511 million, which was primarily related to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, DPS license agreements, our acquisition of OAO Nidan Juices (\"Nidan\"), a Russian juice company, and our additional investment in Fresh Trading Ltd. (\"innocent\"). The Company and the existing shareowners of innocent have a series of outstanding put and call options for the Company to potentially acquire the remaining shares not already owned by the Company. The put and call options are exercisable in stages between 2013 and 2014. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. \n\nIn 2009, our Company's acquisition and investment activities totaled $300 million. None of the acquisitions or investments was individually significant. Included in these investment activities was the acquisition of a minority interest in innocent. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. \n\nIn 2008, our Company's acquisition and investment activities totaled $759 million, which included the acquisition of brands and licenses in Denmark and Finland from Carlsberg Group Beverages for approximately $225 million. None of the other acquisitions during 2008 was individually significant. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nProceeds from Disposals of Bottling Companies and Other Investments \n\nIn 2010, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments were $972 million. These proceeds were primarily related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion and the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&#227;o Junior for approximately $83 million. Refer to the \n\nheading \"Operations Review &#151; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn 2008, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments included proceeds of approximately $275 million, net of the cash balance as of the disposal date, related to the sale of Remil to Coca-Cola FEMSA. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment &#151; Net \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment net of disposals for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $2,081 million, $1,889 million and $1,839 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements.\" Generally, bottling and finished products operations are more capital intensive compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (including our investments in information technology) and the percentage of such totals by operating segment were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Capital expenditures &#160; &#160; $ 2,215 &#160; &#160; $ 1,993 &#160; &#160; $ 1,968 &#160; &#160; &#160; Eurasia &#38; Africa &#160; &#160; 2.7 % &#160; 3.5 % &#160; 3.4 % Europe &#160; &#160; 1.5 &#160; &#160; 3.4 &#160; &#160; 3.9 &#160; Latin America &#160; &#160; 4.2 &#160; &#160; 6.2 &#160; &#160; 2.9 &#160; North America &#160; &#160; 32.1 &#160; &#160; 23.0 &#160; &#160; 25.0 &#160; Pacific &#160; &#160; 4.6 &#160; &#160; 4.6 &#160; &#160; 9.0 &#160; Bottling Investments &#160; &#160; 42.5 &#160; &#160; 41.4 &#160; &#160; 41.6 &#160; Corporate &#160; &#160; 12.4 &#160; &#160; 17.9 &#160; &#160; 14.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2011, our annual capital expenditures will increase as we integrate CCE's North American business and make investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness. The net result of these North America-specific expenditures will result in an estimated increase of $1.0 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program. \n\nIn addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments operating segment. As a result, we expect our annual 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. We currently expect this level of capital expenditure to remain relatively constant for the next two years, but anticipate these levels to decrease over time. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nIn 2010, other investing activities primarily related to the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities due to the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The cash flow impact in other investing activities primarily represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents on the deconsolidated entities' balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Issuances of debt &#160; &#160; $ 15,251 &#160; &#160; $ 14,689 &#160; &#160; $ 4,337 &#160; Payments of debt &#160; &#160; (13,403 ) &#160; (12,326 ) &#160; (4,308 ) Issuances of stock &#160; &#160; 1,666 &#160; &#160; 664 &#160; &#160; 595 &#160; Purchases of stock for treasury &#160; &#160; (2,961 ) &#160; (1,518 ) &#160; (1,079 ) Dividends &#160; &#160; (4,068 ) &#160; (3,800 ) &#160; (3,521 ) Other financing activities &#160; &#160; 50 &#160; &#160; (2 ) &#160; (9 ) &#160; &#160; Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities &#160; &#160; $ &#160; (3,465 ) &#160; $ (2,293 ) &#160; $ (3,985 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDebt Financing \n\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, our long-term debt was rated \"A+\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"Aa3\" by Moody's and \"A+\" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"P-1\" by Moody's and \"F-1\" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider financial information for certain bottlers, including New CCE, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers. \n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. \n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. \n\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. On December 31, 2010, we had $4,850 million in lines of credit available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. \n\nIn 2010, the Company had issuances of debt of $15,251 million, which included $1,171 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $9,503 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. In addition, on November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long-term notes. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repurchase $2,910 million of long-term debt, and the remainder was used to reduce our commercial paper balance. The long-term notes issued on November 15, 2010, had the following general terms: \n\n&#149; $1,250 million total principal notes due May 15, 2012, at a variable interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 0.05 percent; &#149; $1,250 million total principal notes due November 15, 2013, at a fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent; &#149; $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 1.5 percent; and &#149; $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2020, at a fixed interest rate of 3.15 percent. In 2010, the Company had payments of debt of $13,403 million, including the repurchased long-term debt discussed above. Total payments of debt also included $9,667 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt. \n\nIn 2009, the Company had issuances of debt of approximately $14,689 million and payments of debt of $12,326 million. The issuances of debt included approximately $12,397 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, as well as $900 million and $1,350 million of long-term debt due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The payments of debt included approximately $1,861 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less; $10,017 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days; and $448 million related to long-term debt. The increase in issuances and payments of commercial paper with maturities of greater than 90 days was primarily due to a favorable interest rate environment on longer-term commercial paper. As a result, the Company also began investing in longer-term time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Investing Activities.\" \n\nThe issuances of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,001 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days, and approximately $194 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The payments of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,032 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days. \n\nIssuances of Stock \n\nThe issuances of stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nOn July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to 300 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program took effect on October 31, 2006. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of shares repurchased (in millions) &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; Average price per share &#160; &#160; $ 63.85 &#160; &#160; $ 57.09 &#160; &#160; $ 58.01 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSince the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2010, we have purchased approximately 1.4 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $21.37. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2010, we repurchased approximately $3.1 billion of our stock, of which $3.0 billion settled prior to December 31, 2010. We currently expect to repurchase an additional $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion of our stock during 2011. \n\nDividends \n\nAt its February 2011 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 7 percent, raising it to $0.47 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.88 per share in 2011. This is our 49 th consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $1.76 per share, $1.64 per share and $1.52 per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 dividend represented a 7 percent increase from 2009, and the 2009 dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 2008. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\n&#149; any obligation under certain guarantee contracts; &#149; a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; &#149; any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and &#149; any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. As of December 31, 2010, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of approximately $683 million, of which approximately $336 million related to VIEs. These guarantees primarily are related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2010, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. \n\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the Company had $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which $4,597 million was unused and available. While no amounts have been borrowed against these lines of credit, certain portions have been limited due to outstanding letters of credit related to collateral for claims incurred under our self-insurance programs and for certain operating activities. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. \n\nAggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the Company's contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Payments Due by Period &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2012&#150;2013 &#160; &#160; 2014&#150;2015 &#160; &#160; 2016 and Thereafter &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term loans and notes payable 1 : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Commercial paper borrowings &#160; &#160; $ 7,535 &#160; &#160; $ 7,535 &#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings &#160; &#160; 565 &#160; &#160; 565 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Current maturities of long-term debt 2 &#160; &#160; 1,266 &#160; &#160; 1,266 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Long-term debt, net of current maturities 2 &#160; &#160; 13,076 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 3,800 &#160; &#160; 3,392 &#160; &#160; 5,884 &#160; Estimated interest payments 3 &#160; &#160; 7,686 &#160; &#160; 696 &#160; &#160; 1,282 &#160; &#160; 1,027 &#160; &#160; 4,681 &#160; Accrued income taxes 4 &#160; &#160; 273 &#160; &#160; 273 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Purchase obligations 5 &#160; &#160; 12,463 &#160; &#160; 7,615 &#160; &#160; 2,628 &#160; &#160; 1,053 &#160; &#160; 1,167 &#160; Marketing obligations 6 &#160; &#160; 4,557 &#160; &#160; 1,652 &#160; &#160; 1,691 &#160; &#160; 468 &#160; &#160; 746 &#160; Lease obligations &#160; &#160; 1,155 &#160; &#160; 238 &#160; &#160; 386 &#160; &#160; 218 &#160; &#160; 313 &#160; &#160; &#160; Total contractual obligations 4 &#160; &#160; $ 48,576 &#160; &#160; $ 19,840 &#160; &#160; $ 9,787 &#160; &#160; $ 6,158 &#160; &#160; $ 12,791 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper.

We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. 3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term fixed-rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. 4 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was approximately $474 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. 5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2010, was approximately $2,563 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. \n\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\"PPA\") was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2008, the funded status of the Company's primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan declined as a result of the overall stock market decline. In early 2009, the Company contributed approximately $175 million to this plan. Subsequent to this contribution, the plan is sufficiently funded to maintain maximum flexibility as outlined in the PPA. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. In 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $4,837 million, and the fair value of plan assets was approximately $4,118 million. The majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was approximately $2,455 million, and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was approximately $1,379 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately $50 million in 2011 and remain near that level through 2030, decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2010, our self-insurance reserves totaled approximately $502 million. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above. \n\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2010, were approximately $4,279 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. \n\nWe use 75 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; All operating currencies &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; (9 )% &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; Brazilian real &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; (8 )% &#160; 6 % Mexican peso &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; (24 ) &#160; 0 &#160; Australian dollar &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; (8 ) &#160; 1 &#160; South African rand &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; (18 ) British pound &#160; &#160; (2 ) &#160; (18 ) &#160; (9 ) Euro &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; (8 ) &#160; 9 &#160; Japanese yen &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThese percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was an increase of approximately 3 percent in 2010 and a decrease of approximately 11 percent in 2009. Based on the anticipated impact of hedging coverage in place, the Company expects currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the first quarter and full year of 2011. \n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Other Income (Loss) &#151; Net.\" The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $148 million and $34 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $24 million in 2008. \n\nThe remeasurement loss recorded in 2010 was primarily related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation, and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of approximately $103 million during the first quarter of 2010, in the line item other income (loss) &#151; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nThe Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. \n\nOverview of Financial Position \n\nIn 2010, the Company had a number of significant transactions and events that impacted our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#151; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements,\" for additional information related to these transactions and events. The most significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet was related to our acquisition of CCE's North American business, which resulted in the Company recording total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a preliminary allocation of the purchase price by major class of assets and liabilities. The majority of the fluctuations in individual line items in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, were attributable to this acquisition. The following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Company's consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents &#160; &#160; $ 8,517 &#160; &#160; $ 7,021 &#160; &#160; $ 1,496 &#160; Short-term investments &#160; &#160; 2,682 &#160; &#160; 2,130 &#160; &#160; 552 &#160; Marketable securities &#160; &#160; 138 &#160; &#160; 62 &#160; &#160; 76 &#160; Trade accounts receivable &#151; net &#160; &#160; 4,430 &#160; &#160; 3,758 &#160; &#160; 672 &#160; Inventories &#160; &#160; 2,650 &#160; &#160; 2,354 &#160; &#160; 296 &#160; Prepaid expenses and other assets &#160; &#160; 3,162 &#160; &#160; 2,226 &#160; &#160; 936 &#160; Equity method investments &#160; &#160; 6,954 &#160; &#160; 6,217 &#160; &#160; 737 &#160; Other investments, principally bottling companies &#160; &#160; 631 &#160; &#160; 538 &#160; &#160; 93 &#160; Other assets &#160; &#160; 2,121 &#160; &#160; 1,976 &#160; &#160; 145 &#160; Property, plant and equipment &#151; net &#160; &#160; 14,727 &#160; &#160; 9,561 &#160; &#160; 5,166 &#160; Trademarks with indefinite lives &#160; &#160; 6,356 &#160; &#160; 6,183 &#160; &#160; 173 &#160; Bottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives &#160; &#160; 7,511 &#160; &#160; 1,953 &#160; &#160; 5,558 &#160; Goodwill &#160; &#160; 11,665 &#160; &#160; 4,224 &#160; &#160; 7,441 &#160; Other intangible assets &#160; &#160; 1,377 &#160; &#160; 468 &#160; &#160; 909 &#160; &#160; &#160; Total assets &#160; &#160; $ 72,921 &#160; &#160; $ 48,671 &#160; &#160; $ 24,250 &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts payable and accrued expenses &#160; &#160; $ 8,859 &#160; &#160; $ 6,657 &#160; &#160; $ 2,202 &#160; Loans and notes payable &#160; &#160; 8,100 &#160; &#160; 6,749 &#160; &#160; 1,351 &#160; Current maturities of long-term debt &#160; &#160; 1,276 &#160; &#160; 51 &#160; &#160; 1,225 &#160; Accrued income taxes &#160; &#160; 273 &#160; &#160; 264 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; Long-term debt &#160; &#160; 14,041 &#160; &#160; 5,059 &#160; &#160; 8,982 &#160; Other liabilities &#160; &#160; 4,794 &#160; &#160; 2,965 &#160; &#160; 1,829 &#160; Deferred income taxes &#160; &#160; 4,261 &#160; &#160; 1,580 &#160; &#160; 2,681 &#160; &#160; &#160; Total liabilities &#160; &#160; 41,604 &#160; &#160; 23,325 &#160; &#160; 18,279 &#160; &#160; &#160; Net assets &#160; &#160; $ 31,317 &#160; &#160; $ 25,346 &#160; &#160; $ 5,971 1 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 Includes a decrease in net assets of $947 million resulting from translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events: \n\n&#149; Property, plant and equipment &#151; net increased $5,166 million, primarily due to the $5,385 million of property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The impact of this acquisition was partially offset by a decrease of $315 million due to the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and a decrease of $400 million related to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#149; Bottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives increased $5,558 million, primarily due to the $5,100 million of indefinite-lived franchise rights we reacquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business and $865 million related to DPS license agreements. The impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. &#149; Goodwill increased $7,441 million, primarily due to $7,746 million of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The acquired goodwill was partially offset by the impact of the 83 \n\ndeconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#149; Other intangible assets increased $909 million, primarily due to $605 million of definite-lived franchise rights and $380 million of customer rights we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#149; Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2,202 million, primarily due to the $1,826 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase also reflects additional accrued liabilities related to our stock repurchase program for shares purchased but not settled as of December 31, 2010. &#149; Loans and notes payable increased $1,351 million, primarily related to an increase in short-term borrowings to fund the cash payment made in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#149; Current maturities of long-term debt increased $1,225 million, primarily related to an increase in our overall debt balance as a result of our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#149; Long-term debt increased $8,982 million, primarily due to long-term debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities,\" above, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. &#149; Other liabilities increased $1,829 million, primarily due to pension and other postretirement liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. The assumed liabilities consisted of benefit obligations of $3,544 million and plan assets of $2,231 million as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pension and other postretirement plans assumed from CCE. &#149; Deferred income taxes increased $2,681 million, primarily due to deferred tax liabilities recorded on the franchise rights acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices \n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 405, "Negative": 525, "Polarity": -0.12903225792577178, "Subjectivity": 0.05634997576003696}, "similarity_score": 0.9901385465573748, "nlp_result": 0}
