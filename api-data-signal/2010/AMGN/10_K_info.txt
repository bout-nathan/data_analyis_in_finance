MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nForward looking statements \n\n&#160;\n\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management&#146;s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;outlook,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;seek,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;assume&#148; and &#147;continue,&#148; as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward looking statements on our management&#146;s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. \n\n&#160;\n\nOverview \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following management&#146;s discussion and analysis (&#147;MD&#038;A&#148;) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen&#146;s business. MD&#038;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&#038;A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;). \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses. We concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. We operate in one business segment &#151; human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp &#174; , EPOGEN &#174; , Neulasta &#174; , NEUPOGEN &#174; and ENBREL, all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a collaboration agreement with Pfizer in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp &#174; , Neulasta &#174; and NEUPOGEN &#174; . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business &#151; Marketed Products. \n\n&#160;\n\nThroughout 2010 and early 2011, various developments occurred regarding our business, including regulatory and reimbursement developments associated with certain of our marketed products and product candidates. Most notably, the FDA approved Prolia &#174; and XGEVA tm , and the EC granted marketing authorization for Prolia &#174; for certain indications. In addition, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States. As a result of these and other developments, we have various opportunities to grow our business but will also continue to face various challenges. The following summarizes certain key opportunities and challenges. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have various opportunities to grow our business. In the near term, we believe the currently approved indications for Prolia &#174; and XGEVA tm represent significant commercial opportunities. In addition, receipt of regulatory approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications for these products may also provide further significant opportunities. For example, the results of our recently announced phase 3 trial evaluating \n\nXGEVA tm versus placebo in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint. This study will form the basis of planned marketing applications, which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of 2011, for the prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our late-stage pipeline and strategic business development opportunities, such as our recently announced agreement to acquire BioVex. In addition, longer-term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and Japan. \n\n&#160;\n\nLooking forward, we believe our products will continue to face various regulatory, reimbursement and competitive challenges. Our ESA products, in particular, have several near-term challenges that could result in further reductions in sales. For example, EPOGEN &#174; sales will be impacted by the Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis that became effective in 2011. Further, the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the results of the MEDCAC meetings held in March 2010 and January 2011 could lead to an NCD for the use of ESAs in patients with kidney disease, which could impact the use of or reimbursement for ESAs to manage anemia in patients with CKD and/or dialysis-related anemia. In addition, the FDA-approved REMS for ESAs may continue to impact Aranesp &#174; sales in the supportive cancer care setting. Future product label changes (including those we proposed prior to the 2010 CRDAC meeting, any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting and any from the PLR conversion process), may also impact the use of ESAs in CKD. Since we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the recently enacted healthcare reform law has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our products in the United States and on our results of operations. The provisions of the new legislation impacted our U.S. product sales by approximately $200 million in 2010, and we anticipate that our U.S. product sales in 2011 will be impacted by $250 million to $300 million. Furthermore, we estimate that our results of operations for 2011 will be impacted by an additional $150 million to $200 million related to a new fee on manufacturers and importers of &#147;branded prescription drugs&#148; established by that legislation, which is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our products will also continue to face increasing competitive pressure, in particular ENBREL in the United States, as well as Aranesp &#174; , Neulasta &#174; and NEUPOGEN &#174; in Europe as a result of biosimilars. In addition, over the next several years, the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire, and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter. (See Item 1. Business &#151; Marketed Products.) \n\n&#160;\n\nCertain of these developments are expected to have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations. However, these effects may be mitigated by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business, discussed above, by other strategic initiatives or by increased efforts to manage our expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\nSelected Financial Data \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table presents selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in millions, except percentages and per share data): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 Change 2009 &#160; Product sales: \n\nU.S. \n\n$ 11,254 1% $ 11,135 International \n\n3,406 6% 3,216 Total product sales \n\n14,660 2% 14,351 Other revenues \n\n393 35% 291 Total revenues \n\n$ 15,053 3% $ 14,642 Operating expenses \n\n$ 9,508 4% $ 9,136 Operating income \n\n$ 5,545 1% $ 5,506 Net income \n\n$ 4,627 &#151; $ 4,605 Diluted EPS \n\n$ 4.79 6% $ 4.51 Diluted shares \n\n965 (5)% 1,021 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following discusses certain key changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as well as our financial condition as of December 31, 2010. \n\nThe increase in our U.S. product sales for 2010 reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products, except for our ESA products, which declined 5%. The growth in sales of our non-ESA products reflects increases primarily in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. U.S. product sales in 2010 were unfavorably impacted by $198 million as a result of the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform law. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in our international product sales for 2010 reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products, except for Aranesp &#174; , which declined 1%. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in other revenues for 2010 was due primarily to milestone payments earned from Glaxo in connection with certain commercial milestones for Prolia &#174; in the EU and from Takeda in connection with certain regulatory milestones for Vectibix &#174; in Japan. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in operating expenses for 2010 was due principally to higher cost of sales, due primarily to higher bulk manufacturing costs, as well as higher selling, general and administrative (&#147;SG&#038;A&#148;) expenses, due primarily to increased promotional costs for Prolia &#174; and our other marketed products. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet income was relatively unchanged in 2010 as the increases in operating income, discussed above, and interest and other income were offset substantially by an increase in our provision for income taxes. The increase in interest and other income was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments and higher interest income. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due principally to reduced benefits resulting from settlements with tax authorities in 2010. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in diluted EPS for 2010 principally reflects a reduction in our weighted-average shares used to compute diluted EPS resulting from our stock repurchase program, including approximately 67 million shares repurchased in 2010 at a total cost of $3.8 billion. \n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the Euro. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $17.4 billion, and total debt outstanding was $13.4 billion, including $2.5 billion which was repaid in February 2011. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2010, approximately $15.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if those funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. \n\nResults of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nProduct sales \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 &#160; Aranesp &#174; \n\n$ 2,486 (6) % $ 2,652 (15) % $ 3,137 EPOGEN &#174; \n\n2,524 (2) % 2,569 5 % 2,456 Neulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; \n\n4,844 4 % 4,643 &#151; 4,659 ENBREL \n\n3,534 1 % 3,493 (3) % 3,598 Sensipar &#174; /Mimpara &#174; \n\n714 10 % 651 9 % 597 Vectibix &#174; \n\n288 24 % 233 52 % 153 Nplate &#174; \n\n229 &#151; 110 &#151; 17 Prolia &#174; \n\n33 &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; XGEVA tm \n\n8 &#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; Other \n\n&#151; &#151; &#151; &#151; 70 Total product sales \n\n$ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 (2) % $ 14,687 Total U.S. \n\n$ 11,254 1 % $ 11,135 (3) % $ 11,460 Total International \n\n3,406 6 % 3,216 &#151; 3,227 Total product sales \n\n$ 14,660 2 % $ 14,351 (2) % $ 14,687 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nProduct sales are influenced by a number of factors, some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others, including, but not necessarily limited to: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; our contracting and pricing strategies; &#160; &#160; &#149; recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from: ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#161; &#160; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; &#160; &#160; &#161; &#160; legislative reform in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions; &#160; &#160; &#161; &#160; cost containment pressures; and &#160; &#160; &#161; &#160; the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; clinical trial outcomes, including adverse events or results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, studies or meta-analyses performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our products, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; &#160; &#160; &#149; changes in clinical practice, including those resulting from the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments; &#160; &#160; &#149; adoption of and adherence to risk management activities, such as a REMS, undertaken by us or required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; &#160; &#160; &#149; product label changes; &#160; &#160; &#149; patient population growth; &#160; &#160; &#149; segment growth and penetration; &#160; &#160; &#149; new product launches and indications; &#160; &#160; &#149; expansion into new international markets; ##TABLE_END 71 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; competitive products, including biosimilars; &#160; &#160; &#149; patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights; &#160; &#160; &#149; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; &#160; &#160; &#149; adequacy of product supply and distribution; &#160; &#160; &#149; effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including those conducted under collaboration agreements; &#160; &#160; &#149; concentration of customer purchasing power; and &#160; &#160; &#149; acquisitions. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nOur U.S. product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (eg, holiday-driven wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a reduction in demand and/or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period, which we believe to be due, in part, to certain of these factors. While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, general economic conditions may affect, or in some cases amplify, certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales. (See Item 1. Business &#151; Marketed Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) \n\n&#160;\n\nAranesp &#174; \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total Aranesp &#174; sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 &#160; Aranesp &#174; &#160;&#151; U.S. \n\n$ 1,103 (12 ) % $ 1,251 (24 ) % $ 1,651 Aranesp &#174; &#160;&#151; International \n\n1,383 (1 ) % 1,401 (6 ) % 1,486 Total Aranesp &#174; \n\n$ 2,486 (6 ) % $ 2,652 (15 ) % $ 3,137 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nThe decrease in U.S. Aranesp &#174; sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand, reflecting an overall decline in the segment. The decrease in international Aranesp &#174; sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in demand. \n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. sales of Aranesp &#174; for 2008 benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves. Excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates, the decrease in U.S. Aranesp &#174; sales of approximately 21% for 2009 was due primarily to a decline in unit demand and a low single-digit percentage point decrease in the average net sales price. The decline in unit demand reflects the negative impact, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting, of a product safety-related label change in August 2008 as well as an overall decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share. Excluding an $85 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, international Aranesp &#174; sales for 2009 remained unchanged. \n\nIn addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Aranesp &#174; sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; regulatory developments, including: ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#161; &#160; the REMS for our ESAs approved by the FDA in February 2010; &#160; &#160; &#161; &#160; product label changes, including those proposed prior to the October 2010 CRDAC meeting and any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting, as well as any from the PLR conversion process; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; reimbursement developments, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; and &#160; &#160; &#149; development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nCertain of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp &#174; . \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Item 1.

Risk Factors herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nEPOGEN &#174; \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total EPOGEN &#174; sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 &#160; EPOGEN &#174; &#160;&#151; U.S. \n\n$ 2,524 (2)% $ 2,569 5% $ 2,456 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nThe decrease in EPOGEN &#174; sales for 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in unit demand and certain changes in accounting estimates. The decrease in unit demand reflects a decrease in dose utilization, offset partially by patient population growth. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in EPOGEN &#174; sales for 2009 was due primarily to an increase in unit demand and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average net sales price. The increase in unit demand was due principally to patient population growth and increased dose utilization. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future EPOGEN &#174; sales will depend, in part, on such factors as: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; reimbursement developments, including those resulting from: ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#161; &#160; CMS&#146;s Final Rule on Bundling in Dialysis; &#160; &#160; &#161; &#160; Other CMS activities, including the potential imposition of an NCD or other developments resulting from the NCA opened by CMS in June 2010 and the associated MEDCAC meetings; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; regulatory developments, such as those resulting from product label changes, including those proposed prior to the October 2010 CRDAC meeting and any others required in connection with TREAT or the CRDAC meeting, as well as any from the PLR conversion process; &#160; &#160; &#149; changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling; and &#160; &#160; &#149; adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with CRF. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nCertain of the above factors are expected to have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN &#174; . \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Item 1.

The increase in international Neulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; sales for 2010 reflects primarily growth in Neulasta &#174; principally from the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN &#174; to Neulasta &#174; , offset partially by a decline in NEUPOGEN &#174; as a result of biosimilar competition. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in U.S. sales of Neulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; for 2009 was due primarily to a low single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. Excluding a $94 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, international Neulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; sales increased 4% for 2009, due primarily to an increase in demand, reflecting the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN &#174; to Neulasta &#174; . \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to other factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future Neulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; sales will depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Item 1. Business &#151; Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nENBREL \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 &#160; ENBREL &#151; U.S. \n\n$ 3,304 1% $ 3,283 (3)% $ 3,389 ENBREL &#151; Canada \n\n230 10% 210 &#151; 209 Total ENBREL \n\n$ 3,534 1% $ 3,493 (3)% $ 3,598 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in ENBREL sales for 2010 reflects an increase in the average net sales price, offset partially by a low single-digit percentage point decline in unit demand, resulting primarily from share declines in dermatology. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2009 was due primarily to an unfavorable change in wholesaler inventories resulting from an approximate $100 million wholesaler inventory build in 2008 related to a shift of ENBREL to a wholesaler distribution model and a decline in unit demand as a result of competitive activity, offset partially by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price. \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Item 1. Business &#151; Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. \n\nSelected operating expenses \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 &#160; Operating expenses: \n\nCost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets presented below) \n\n$ 2,220 6 % $ 2,091 (9 )% $ 2,296 % of product sales \n\n15.1% 14.6% 15.6% Research and development \n\n$ 2,894 1 % $ 2,864 (5 )% $ 3,030 % of product sales \n\n19.7% 20.0% 20.6% Selling, general and administrative \n\n$ 3,983 4 % $ 3,820 1 % $ 3,789 % of product sales \n\n27.2% 26.6% 25.8% Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets \n\n$ 294 &#151; $ 294 &#151; $ 294 Other charges \n\n$ 117 75 % $ 67 (82 )% $ 380 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160;\n\nCost of sales, which excludes the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, increased to 15.1% of product sales for 2010, driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write-offs due to voluntary EPOGEN &#174; , PROCRIT &#174; (Epoetin alfa) and ENBREL recalls. These increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties, primarily for ENBREL. \n\n&#160;\n\nCost of sales decreased to 14.6% of product sales for 2009, driven primarily by lower excess capacity charges, lower excess inventory write-offs, due primarily to the $84 million write-off of inventory in 2008 resulting from a strategic decision to change manufacturing processes, and lower royalty expenses. These decreases were offset partially by less favorable product mix and higher fill and finish costs resulting from lower utilization at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. \n\n&#160;\n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160;\n\nR&#038;D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems&#146; costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&#038;D with alternative future uses. R&#038;D expenses include costs incurred under R&#038;D arrangements with our corporate partners, such as activities performed on behalf of KA, and costs and cost recoveries associated with collaborative R&#038;D and in-licensing arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaboration partners in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&#038;D costs for arrangements with our corporate partners is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in R&#038;D expenses for 2010 was driven primarily by $110 million of lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations and higher staff-related costs of $84 million. These increases were offset largely by lower licensing fees of $115 million, associated principally with payments made in 2009 under the Cytokinetics and Array BioPharma Inc. (&#147;Array&#148;) agreements, and reduced denosumab clinical trial costs of $73 million in 2010. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe decrease in R&#038;D expenses for 2009 was driven primarily by lower clinical trial costs of $128 million, including those associated with our denosumab and Vectibix &#174; registrational studies, our marketed products and the delay of the phase 3 motesanib NSCLC trial, and $14 million lower staff-related costs. The higher licensing fees incurred in 2009, which were related to the $60 million expense associated with the Array agreement and the $50 million expense resulting from the payment to Cytokinetics, were offset substantially by the $100 million expense in 2008 resulting from the upfront payment associated with the Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. collaboration. \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\n&#160;\n\nSG&#038;A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&#038;A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&#038;A costs for collaborations is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. In connection with a collaboration agreement, we and Pfizer market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada, and Pfizer is paid a share of the related profits, as defined. The share of ENBREL&#146;s profits owed to Pfizer is included in SG&#038;A expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in SG&#038;A expenses for 2010 was due primarily to higher promotional costs for Prolia &#174; and other marketed products of $148 million, higher staff-related costs of $46 million and higher litigation expenses of $45 million, offset partially by charges of $29 million in 2009 for certain cost savings initiatives related to our 2007 restructuring plan. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in SG&#038;A expenses for 2009 was due primarily to higher product promotional expenses of $207 million, including increased spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia &#174; . This increase was offset substantially by lower litigation expenses of $38 million, lower expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share of $32 million, expense recoveries associated with our Glaxo collaboration agreement for Prolia &#174; in PMO in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico of $29 million, lower staff-related costs of $28 million, lower global enterprise resource planning (&#147;ERP&#148;) system related expenses of $28 million and lower restructuring and related costs of $8 million. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the expense associated with the ENBREL profit share was $1,184 million, $1,163 million and $1,195 million, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nAmortization of certain acquired intangible assets \n\n&#160;\n\nAmortization of certain acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. \n\n&#160;\n\nOther charges \n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our continuing efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. In 2009, the Company recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain legal proceedings aggregating $33 million. In 2008, the Company recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating $288 million, related principally to the settlement of the Ortho Biotech antitrust suit. \n\n&#160;\n\nNon-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table presents non-operating expenses/income and the provisions for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 2009 2008 &#160; Interest expense, net \n\n$ 604 $ 578 $ 551 Interest and other income, net \n\n$ 376 $ 276 $ 352 Provisions for income taxes \n\n$ 690 $ 599 $ 963 Effective tax rate \n\n13.0% 11.5% 19.2% ##TABLE_END \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $266 million, $250 million and $235 million, respectively, resulting from the change in the accounting for our convertible debt effective January 1, 2009. \n\n&#160;\n\nInterest and other income, net \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in interest and other income, net for 2010 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of $48 million and higher interest income of $51 million, due principally to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2009 was due primarily to: lower interest income of $45 million, due principally to lower portfolio investment returns; lower net gains on sales of investments of $28 million; and higher losses on certain leased facilities that will no longer be used in our operations of $31 million; offset partially by higher foreign currency exchange net gains of $27 million. \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2010 was due primarily to: the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years&#146; matters with tax authorities in 2009 compared to 2010; the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in 2010; and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009 and effective for subsequent periods. The resolution of prior years&#146; tax matters recognized in 2010 and 2009 reduced the effective tax rate by 3.1% and 4.2%, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2009 was due principally to: the favorable resolution of certain income tax examinations; higher profits and manufacturing in Puerto Rico, which are taxed under an incentive grant; and a tax benefit from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes arising from changes in California tax law enacted in 2009. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. \n\n&#160;\n\n(See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies &#151; Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) \n\n&#160;\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements \n\n&#160;\n\nIn January 2010, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 17, Fair value measurement. This standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. In addition, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard requires additional disclosure and requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity for Level 3 fair value measurements on a gross as opposed to a net basis. As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, its adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn January 2011, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which addresses the accounting for the annual fee due from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry beginning January 1, 2011, mandated by the PPACA and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made certain changes and adjustments to PPACA. We refer to these two laws collectively as the &#147;new healthcare reform law.&#148; The new healthcare reform law obligates a pharmaceutical manufacturer, upon the first gross receipt during a calendar year from prescription drug sales under any specified government program, to pay an annual fee to the U.S. government. The new accounting standard requires the liability for the annual fee to be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost established that is to be amortized and recognized as an operating expense over \n\nthe calendar year that it is payable using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee. We have elected to amortize this fee on a straight-line basis and it will be recorded in SG&#038;A expense. \n\n&#160;\n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 2009 &#160; Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n$ 17,422 $ 13,442 Total assets \n\n43,486 39,629 Current debt \n\n2,488 &#151; Non-current debt \n\n10,874 10,601 Stockholders&#146; equity \n\n23,944 22,667 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to opportunistically pursue our stock repurchase program and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sale of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other debt markets and equity markets. In February 2011, our 2011 Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $2.5 billion were repaid in full. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.) \n\n&#160;\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160;\n\nOf our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2010, approximately $15.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. \n\nFinancing arrangements \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 2009 &#160; 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) \n\n$ 2,488 $ 2,342 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) \n\n2,213 2,088 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) \n\n1,099 1,099 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) \n\n1,000 1,000 5.70% notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) \n\n998 998 6.40% notes due 2039 (2039 Notes) \n\n996 995 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) \n\n899 899 3.45% notes due October 2020 (October 2020 Notes) \n\n897 &#151; 5.75% notes due 2040 (2040 Notes) \n\n696 &#151; 4.95% notes due 2041 (2041 Notes) \n\n595 &#151; 6.15% notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) \n\n499 499 6.90% notes due 2038 (2038 Notes) \n\n499 499 4.50% notes due March 2020 (March 2020 Notes) \n\n300 &#151; Other notes \n\n183 182 Total borrowings \n\n13,362 10,601 Less current portion \n\n(2,488 ) &#151; Total non-current debt \n\n$ 10,874 $ 10,601 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nWe issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2010, including: in 2010, $300 million principal amount of March 2020 Notes, $700 million principal amount of 2040 Notes, $900 million principal amount of October 2020 Notes and $600 million principal amount of 2041 Notes; in 2009, $1.0 billion principal amount of 2019 Notes and $1.0 billion principal amount of 2039 Notes; and in 2008, $500 million principal amount of 2018 Notes and $500 million principal amount of 2038 Notes. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with these debt offerings totaled $17 million, $13 million and $6 million for debt issued in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are being amortized over the respective lives of the notes. \n\n&#160;\n\nAll of these debt issuances as well as the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes may be redeemed at any time at our option, in whole or in part, at the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest and a &#147;make-whole&#148; amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of these debt issuances at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2009, we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and in 2008, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating London Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) based notes. \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Note 15, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our Convertible Notes. \n\n&#160;\n\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The effective rates on these swaps range from LIBOR plus 0.3% to LIBOR plus 2.6%. See Note 15, Financing arrangements and Note 18, Derivative instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap agreements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.3 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, we have a $2.3 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit facility that matures in November 2012 and is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. Annual commitment fees for this facility are 0.05% based on our current credit rating. As of December 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which allows us to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units and depository shares. Under this registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration expires in April 2011. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, we have $400 million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in 1997. In connection with this shelf registration, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2010, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. \n\n&#160;\n\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2010. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants. \n\n&#160;\n\nCash flows \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 2009 2008 &#160; Net cash provided by operating activities \n\n$ 5,787 $ 6,336 $ 5,988 Net cash used in investing activities \n\n(4,152 ) (3,202 ) (3,165 ) Net cash used in financing activities \n\n(1,232 ) (2,024 ) (3,073 ) ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating \n\n&#160;\n\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during 2010 decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities. Cash provided by operating activities during 2009 increased due primarily to higher net income of $553 million and a higher dividend payment from KA of $102 million, offset partially by the prior-year receipt of $300 million for an upfront milestone payment related to our licensing agreement with Takeda, and the negative impact of the timing and amounts of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and others. \n\n&#160;\n\nInvesting \n\n&#160;\n\nNet purchases of marketable securities were $3.5 billion for 2010 compared to net purchases of $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nCapital expenditures totaled $580 million, $530 million and $672 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and other site developments. Capital expenditures in 2008 were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Puerto Rico, Fremont and other site developments and with investment in our global ERP system and other information systems&#146; projects. We currently estimate 2011 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $600 million. \n\nFinancing \n\n&#160;\n\nIn December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock of which a total of $2.2 billion remains available as of December 31, 2010. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including stock price, blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares and the impact of repurchases on our credit rating, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 2009 2008 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars &#160; First quarter \n\n29.1 $ 1,684 37.5 $ 1,997 &#151; $ &#151; Second quarter \n\n10.3 616 &#151; &#151; 32.7 1,549 (1) Third quarter \n\n6.6 364 &#151; &#151; &#151; 19 (1) Fourth quarter \n\n20.5 1,136 21.7 1,211 12.6 700 Total \n\n66.5 $ 3,800 59.2 $ 3,208 45.3 $ 2,268 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2008 excludes approximately $19 million paid in July 2008 in connection with the final settlement of an accelerated share repurchase program entered into in May 2008. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nAs discussed above, we issued debt securities in various offerings that resulted in net proceeds of $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we repaid $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion of notes in 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options. Employee stock option exercises provided $80 million, $171 million and $155 million of cash in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. \n\n&#160;\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n&#160;\n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160;\n\nContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. \n\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, aggregated by type (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Payments due by period Year Years Years Years Contractual obligations Total 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyond &#160; Long-term debt obligations (1) \n\n$ 22,259 $ 2,900 $ 3,389 $ 1,892 $ 14,078 Operating lease obligations \n\n1,009 140 246 189 434 Purchase obligations (2) \n\n3,263 1,020 560 131 1,552 Unrecognized tax benefits (3) \n\n200 200 &#151; &#151; &#151; Total contractual obligations \n\n$ 26,731 $ 4,260 $ 4,195 $ 2,212 $ 16,064 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2010 to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps. See Note 15, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations and our interest swap agreements. &#160; (2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&#038;D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. &#160; (3) Long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (&#147;UTBs&#148;) (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $625 million at December 31, 2010 are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nIn addition to the above table, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third parties. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangements is approximately $2.1 billion. \n\n&#160;\n\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies \n\n&#160;\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\n&#160;\n\nProduct sales, sales deductions and returns \n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, &#147;sales deductions&#148;) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to \n\nreflect actual results. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in &#147;Accrued liabilities&#148; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash Other Rebates Chargebacks discounts deductions Total &#160; Balance as of January 1, 2008 \n\n$ 755 $ 70 $ 42 $ 197 $ 1,064 Amounts charged against product sales \n\n1,813 1,635 324 466 4,238 Payments \n\n(2,064 ) (1,621 ) (323 ) (418 ) (4,426 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 \n\n504 84 43 245 876 Amounts charged against product sales \n\n1,497 2,424 312 406 4,639 Payments \n\n(1,482 ) (2,380 ) (328 ) (355 ) (4,545 ) Balance as of December 31, 2009 \n\n519 128 27 296 970 Amounts charged against product sales \n\n1,522 2,593 347 572 5,034 Payments \n\n(1,525 ) (2,548 ) (345 ) (442 ) (4,860 ) Balance as of December 31, 2010 \n\n$ 516 $ 173 $ 29 $ 426 $ 1,144 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total sales deductions were 25%, 24% and 22% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for 2010 and 2009 and less than 2% for 2008. In late 2008, we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers (reflected as chargebacks in the table above) instead of rebates, resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks, as noted in the table above. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. \n\n&#160;\n\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. \n\n&#160;\n\nRebates primarily include amounts paid to payers in the United States and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which could take up to one year. Those rebates totaled $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for 2010 and 2009 and less than 3.5% for 2008. These changes in annual estimates relate substantially to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 2% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2010 would have had an impact of approximately $30 million on our 2010 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. \n\n&#160;\n\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers \n\npurchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices it pays us and the prices it charges the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. \n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in other deductions in the table above are rebates and discounts paid to state Medicaid offices to participate in the Medicaid program. In 2010, healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States which has and will continue to significantly increase our Medicaid rebates and discounts. Certain provisions of this new legislation became effective in 2010, while others will become effective in later years. The provisions of this new legislation reduced our U.S. product sales in 2010 by approximately $200 million, and we anticipate that our U.S. product sales in 2011 will be negatively impacted by $250 million to $300 million by this legislation. \n\n&#160;\n\nProduct returns \n\n&#160;\n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Furthermore, changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant. \n\n&#160;\n\nInventories produced in preparation for product launches \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. In connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory, we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidate&#146;s safety and efficacy, the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns. In addition, we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as consider the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date. Upon capitalization, we continue to monitor any changes in these factors. In the event of any significant negative developments, we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs. At December 31, 2009, we had capitalized approximately $258 million of inventory costs related to our then late-stage product candidate, denosumab. During 2010, we received various approvals for denosumab from regulatory authorities in the United States, the EU and various other countries and commenced selling the product in certain geographic markets. \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. \n\nCertain items are included in the Company&#146;s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements. Such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; or (ii) an expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable U.S. and state marginal income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. For example, substantial reform of U.S. tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n\n&#160;\n\nContingencies \n\n&#160;\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 19, Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. \n\n&#160;\n\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 106, "Negative": 106, "Polarity": 0.0, "Subjectivity": 0.04577844956903942}, "similarity_score": 0.9621183743764438, "nlp_result": -0.025064741425654468}
