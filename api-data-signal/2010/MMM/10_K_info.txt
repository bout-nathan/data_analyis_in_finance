Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M&#146;s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M&#146;s MD&#38;A is presented in eight sections: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#183; &#160; Overview \n\n&#183; &#160; Results of Operations \n\n&#183; &#160; Performance by Business Segment \n\n&#183; &#160; Performance by Geographic Area \n\n&#183; &#160; Critical Accounting Estimates \n\n&#183; &#160; New Accounting Pronouncements \n\n&#183; &#160; Financial Condition and Liquidity \n\n&#183; &#160; Financial Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2010, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Electro and Communications. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2010 sales grew nearly 10 percent to $6.7 billion, despite negative comparisons from H1N1 and moderating sales growth in optical films for LCD TVs. Sales growth was broad-based, with organic sales volumes expanding in all businesses, led by a 19.8 percent increase in Electro and Communications and a 14.7 percent increase in Display and Graphics. Geographically, organic sales volume was strongest in Asia Pacific at 18.1 percent and Latin America at 12.2 percent. Net income attributable to 3M in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $928 million, or $1.28 per diluted shares, compared to $935 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth-quarter income was penalized by year-on-year H1N1-related comparisons, increases in raw material costs, and investments to accelerate future growth. 3M continues to invest in research and development, sales and marketing (including advertising and merchandising investments), and also incurred acquisition-related costs in the fourth quarter. 3M made several large fourth-quarter 2010 acquisitions, including Arizant Inc., Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2010, 3M achieved record net sales and diluted earnings per share, while investing significantly to improve long-term growth. For example, research, development and related expenses of $1.4 billion helped to drive innovation and new product sales. 3M also accelerated sales and marketing investments in high-growth markets to help secure future growth. The Company posted 2010 sales of $26.7 billion and earnings of $5.63 per diluted share, up 15.3 percent and 24.6 percent, respectively. All businesses posted positive organic volume growth, led by Electro and Communications at 26.9 percent, Display and Graphics at 26.5 percent, and Industrial and Transportation at 16.9 percent. Including special items (discussed below), net income attributable to 3M in 2010 was $4.085 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.193 billion or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2009, and $3.460 billion, or $4.89 per diluted share, in 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, 3M recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has been aggressively restructuring the company since early 2008 and continued this effort through the third quarter of 2009, with these restructuring actions and exit activities resulting in an aggregate reduction of approximately 6,400 positions. The related net restructuring charges and other special items reduced net income attributable to 3M for year 2009 by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Special items reduced net income attributable to 3M for year 2008 by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. Refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. These restructuring actions and exit activities resulted in savings of almost $400 million in 2009 and additional incremental savings of more than $150 million in 2010, with the majority of \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2010&#146;s benefit in the first half of the year. In addition, 3M amended its policy regarding banked vacation in 2009, which added more than $100 million to operating income in 2009, with a benefit of approximately $80 million in 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in 2009 totaled $23.1 billion, a decrease of 8.5 percent from 2008. In 2009, the global economic slowdown dramatically affected comparisons for 3M&#146;s businesses. Substantial end-market declines and inventory takedowns in major industries, including automotive, consumer electronics and general industrial manufacturing, resulted in significantly lower sales and income. Accordingly, 3M reduced its cost structure, lowered manufacturing output and intensified its attention to operational improvement. The combination of these actions drove operating income margins of 20.8 percent in 2009, compared to 20.6 percent in 2008. Restructuring charges and other special items reduced this operating income margin by approximately one percentage point in both 2009 and 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, four of 3M&#146;s six business segments posted sales increases in excess of 10 percent. Operating income margins were 21 percent or higher in all six of the Company&#146;s business segments. The following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2010 vs. 2009 % change \n\n&#160; \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales \n\n&#160; \n\n% of Total \n\n&#160; \n\nOper.

Sales growth in these business segments was led by consumer electronics, automotive OEM, renewable energy, and broad-based consumer and office growth, as well as sales growth in those businesses that serve the broad industrial manufacturing sector. Local-currency sales (which includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes divestiture and translation impacts) increased 14.4 percent. Foreign currency effects added 1.0 percent to sales, while divestiture impacts reduced sales by 0.1 percent. Operating income margins for the 2010 were 22.2 percent, compared to 20.8 percent in 2009. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; and &#147;Performance by Geographic Area&#148; later in MD&#38;A for discussion by business segment and geographic area of sales change and items that impacted reported operating income. Refer to Note 17 for discussion of Corporate and Unallocated and Elimination of Dual Credit. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M generated $5.2 billion of operating cash flows in 2010, an increase of $233 million when compared to 2009. This followed an increase of $408 million when comparing 2009 to 2008. In 2010, the Company utilized approximately $1.5 billion of cash to pay dividends. In February 2011, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, replacing the Company&#146;s existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. The Company repurchased $854 million of 3M common stock in 2010. In 2009, with the Company&#146;s emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength, share repurchase activity was minimal, as no broker repurchases of stock were made. This compared to repurchases of 3M common stock of $1.6 billion in 2008. In February 2011, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 4.8 percent for 2011, marking the 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M&#146;s debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2010 was 25 percent, compared to 30 percent at December 31, 2009, and 39 percent at December 31, 2008. A portion of the increase in debt at year-end 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the U.S. given the difficult market environment at that point in time. 3M has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nwith a stable outlook from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. In addition to cash on hand, the Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, the Company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. This was driven by higher basic feedstock costs, particularly oil-derived materials and metals. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2011, 3M expects sales growth of 10 percent or more, with organic sales volume growing 5.5 to 7.5 percent, currency effects adding 1 to 2 percent (assuming December 31, 2010 exchange rates), and acquisitions adding 4 to 6 percent for the year. This expected sales growth and related incremental operating income, including a benefit from currency effects (assuming December 31, 2010 exchange rates), should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings, as summarized below. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere are a few major items that will negatively impact earnings in 2011. First, as discussed further below, 3M expects that pension and postretirement expense will decrease 2011 earnings, when compared to 2010, by approximately 22 cents per diluted share. A banked vacation policy change made in 2009 will also negatively impact earnings in 2011. Prior to 2009, 3M allowed employees to bank a certain amount of unused vacation. Effective January 1, 2009, 3M employees were given two years to use their previously banked vacation, with the resulting reduction in 3M&#146;s liability benefiting both 2009 and 2010 operating results. This change resulted in an estimated 8 cent per diluted share benefit in 2010 results, which will not carry-over into 2011, and thus, will negatively impact 2011 versus 2010 comparisons. Finally, 3M&#146;s early assessment of the income tax rate indicates an expected 2011 effective tax rate of approximately 29.5 percent compared to 27.7 percent for 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M&#146;s pension and postretirement plans were 90 percent funded at year-end 2010. The U.S. qualified plan, which is approximately 71 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 97 percent funded, the non-qualified pension plan was not funded, and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. Asset returns in 2010 for the U.S. qualified plan were 14.4% while the year-end 2010 discount rate was 5.23%, down 0.54 percentage points from the 2009 discount rate of 5.77%. 3M expects to contribute $400 million to $600 million of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2011. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2011. 3M expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2011 to increase by approximately $213 million pre-tax, or 22 cents per diluted share, when compared to 2010. Refer to critical accounting estimates within MD&#38;A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M&#146;s pension and post-retirement plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled &#147;Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results&#148; in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecial Items: \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecial items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in the Company&#146;s underlying operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, 3M recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Act&#148;). The charge is due to a reduction in the value of the company&#146;s deferred tax asset as a result of the Act&#146;s change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements. This item is discussed in more detail in Note 8 (Income Taxes). \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $194 million and net income attributable to 3M by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. 2009 included restructuring actions ($209 million pre-tax, $128 million after tax and noncontrolling interest), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($15 million pre-tax, $9 million after tax). The gain on sale of real estate relates to the June 2009 sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility, which is recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment. Restructuring is discussed in more detail in Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2008, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $269 million and net income attributable to 3M by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. 2008 included restructuring actions ($229 million pre-tax, $147 million after-tax and noncontrolling interest), exit activities ($58 million pre-tax, $43 million after-tax) and losses related to the sale of businesses ($23 million pre-tax, $32 million after-tax), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($41 million pre-tax, $28 million after-tax). Divestiture impacts, restructuring actions and exit activities are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures) and Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities). Concerning the real estate gain, 3M received proceeds and recorded a gain in 2008 for a sale-leaseback transaction relative to an administrative location in Italy. \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,210 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,452 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,662 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,123 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n34.5 \n\n% \n\n65.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n36.8 \n\n% \n\n63.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n7.0 \n\n% \n\n17.6 \n\n% \n\n13.7 \n\n% \n\n(11.9 \n\n)% \n\n(8.1 \n\n)% \n\n(9.5 \n\n)% \n\nVolume &#151; acquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4 \n\n) \n\n(0.2 \n\n) \n\n2.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales (including acquisitions) \n\n&#160; \n\n8.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n18.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.0 \n\n) \n\n(4.7 \n\n) \n\n(5.6 \n\n) \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.4 \n\n) \n\n(2.8 \n\n) \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n8.2 \n\n% \n\n19.4 \n\n% \n\n15.3 \n\n% \n\n(7.3 \n\n)% \n\n(9.2 \n\n)% \n\n(8.5 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn 2010, local-currency sales increased 14.4 percent.

Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.9 percent in 2010, a decrease of 0.5 percentage points from 2009. A number of positive factors impacted year-on-year results. These factors included 13.7 percent growth in organic sales volume, improved factory utilization levels, along with cost savings related to prior years&#146; restructuring actions. In addition, 2009 included a penalty of 0.5 percentage points (as a percent of net sales) related to special items. As discussed in Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities), in 2009, 3M recorded $209 million in restructuring charges, of which $110 million was recorded in cost of sales. This was partially offset by a $15 million gain on sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility, which was also recorded in cost of sales. In addition, 3M decided to swap Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars in 2009, given the economic conditions in Venezuela at that time, which also negatively impacted cost of sales in 2009. These year-on-year net benefits were partially offset by pricing impacts, as selling prices declined 0.2 percent year-on-year, and raw material prices increased approximately 2 percent year-on-year on a gross basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008. As discussed above, 2009 included a net penalty of 0.5 percentage points, or $95 million, related to special items. In 2008, $122 million in restructuring and exit activities were recorded in cost of sales. Thus, restructuring and other items were $27 million lower year-on-year, benefiting cost of sales by 0.1 percentage point. Other benefits to cost of sales as a percent of net sales included increases in selling prices and a slight decrease in material costs. The Company was also able to mitigate organic volume declines through reductions in 3M&#146;s manufacturing cost structure. Finally, in \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nresponse to deteriorating conditions in Venezuela, 3M Venezuela swapped bolivars into U.S. dollars in 2009. While increasing cost of sales, these actions mitigated 3M&#146;s exposure to future exchange rate risks. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses increased 12 percent in 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2010, sales and marketing expenses increased 14 percent, which included advertising and promotion investment increases of over 20 percent in 2010. These increased investments are expected to help drive sales volumes, both now and into the future. In addition, 3M has increased both sales coverage and its marketing strength, particularly in faster-growing emerging economies. In 2010, general and administrative costs remained under control, as these costs increased at approximately half the rate of 2010 sales growth. SG&#38;A expenses, measured as a percent of net sales, decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009. As indicated in Note 4, restructuring expenses of $91 million were recorded in SG&#38;A expenses in 2009. Measured as a percent of sales, these restructuring expenses increased 2009 SG&#38;A expenses by 0.4 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.4 percentage points in 2009 when compared to 2008, but decreased $338 million in dollars, helped by savings from restructuring and other actions. In the sales and marketing area, advertising and merchandising costs were down year-on-year, but were up in the fourth quarter. As indicated above, restructuring expenses increased 2009 SG&#38;A expenses as a percent of sales by 0.4 percentage points. In 2008, restructuring actions and exit activities, net of a gain on sale of real estate, increased SG&#38;A by $111 million, which increased SG&#38;A as a percent of sales by 0.5 percentage points. In the fourth quarter of 2008, as part of its restructuring program, 3M took aggressive actions to reduce general and administrative expenses and also pared back selling and marketing costs in certain businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&#38;D) increased 11 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, as 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives. R&#38;D as a percent of net sales declined to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent in both 2009 and 2008. R&#38;D expenses in dollars declined approximately 8 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Overall dollar spending in 2009 was impacted by company-wide cost initiatives, such as reductions in indirect spending. \n\n&#160; \n\nGain/Loss from Sale of Businesses: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment) in the second quarter of 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income was 22.2 percent of sales in 2010, compared to 20.8 percent of sales in 2009 and 20.6 percent of sales in 2008. 2009 was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, net of a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by 0.9 percentage points ($194 million). 2008 was negatively impacted by restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses that were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by 1.1 percentage points ($269 million). \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Expense and Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n(38 \n\n) \n\n(37 \n\n) \n\n(105 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInterest Expense : Interest expense decreased in 2010, driven by lower average U.S. debt balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense increased slightly in 2009, primarily due to higher average U.S. long-term debt balances largely offset by benefits from reduced short-term balances and lower interest rates. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Income: In 2010, interest income was basically unchanged from 2009, with higher average cash and cash equivalent balances largely offset by lower interest rates. Interest income declined in 2009 when compared to 2008, primarily due to lower yields on investments. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for Income Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Percent of pre-tax income) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n27.7 \n\n% \n\n30.0 \n\n% \n\n31.1 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.7 percent, compared with 30.0 percent in 2009 and 31.1 percent in 2008. The most significant item that decreased the effective tax rate in both 2010 and 2009 related to international taxes. In 2010, this was due primarily to the 2010 tax benefits resulting from the corporate alignment transactions that allowed the Company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary. The transactions are described in the section of Note 6 entitled &#147;Purchase of Subsidiary Shares and Transfers of Ownership Interest Involving Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.&#148; \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2010 also includes a one-time income tax charge of $84 million as a result of the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Adjustments to income tax reserves and the Domestic Manufacturer&#146;s deduction also benefited year-on-year effective tax rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn December 17, 2010, the provision for the research and development credit was extended by the &#147;2010 Tax Relief Act&#148; for expenditures incurred up to December 31, 2012. The provision for the credit had expired on December 31, 2009. The Company recognized the full year benefit of the credit in the fourth quarter of 2010. The benefit of the credit for the full year in 2010 is not materially different from the full year benefit in 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2011 will be approximately 29.5 percent. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 8 for further discussion of income taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which is 3M&#146;s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As of December 31, 2010, 3M&#146;s effective ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited is 75 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $15 million in 2010 and decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $220 million in 2009. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $115 million in 2010 and had an immaterial impact in 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDisclosures relating to 3M&#146;s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2010, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. The reportable segments are Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Display and Graphics; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; and Electro and Communications. Information related to 3M&#146;s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Local-currency sales change amounts are separated into organic local-currency sales (which include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts) and acquisition impacts.

Industrial and Transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, energy control products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2010 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Industrial and Transportation increased 18.7 percent to $8.6 billion. In local-currency terms, sales increased 17.5 percent, driven almost entirely by organic volume. Foreign currency impacts added 1.2 percent to 2010 sales growth. Geographically, local-currency sales growth increased in all major geographic regions, led by Asia Pacific. Local-currency sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio, led by renewable energy, automotive OEM, energy and advanced materials, aerospace, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income increased 43 percent to $1.8 billion in 2010, with operating income margins of 21.0 percent. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $89 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits of $84 million and fixed asset impairments of $5 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation continues to invest aggressively to accelerate its growth capability. In February 2011, 3M completed its acquisition of the tape-related assets of Alpha Beta Enterprise Co. Ltd., a leading manufacturer of box sealing tape and masking tape headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. In addition, in December 2010, 3M announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Winterthur Technologies AG (Winterthur) by way of a public tender offer. The associated offer period was extended to February 25, 2011 (refer to Note 2 for additional information). Winterthur, based in Zug, Switzerland, is a leading global supplier of precision grinding technology serving customers in the area of hard-to-grind precision applications in industrial, automotive, aircraft, and cutting tools. Capital spending in the Industrial and Transportation business included solar energy in the U.S. and industrial adhesives and tapes in China. Capital spending on these projects will carry over into 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation is a large and highly diversified set of businesses that, when taken together, correlate well with the overall economy. Early in 2009, the business saw significant sales declines that required swift and aggressive restructuring and cost reduction plans to offset the impact of lower volumes, including the impact of large inventory declines in the wholesale distribution channel. Inventories began to stabilize around mid-year 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, sales were $7.2 billion, down 12.8 percent in dollars and down 10.2 percent in local currency. Foreign currency impacts penalized sales for the year by 2.6 percent. Sales increased in the renewable energy and automotive aftermarket businesses, but sales decreased in the other businesses, impacted by end-market declines. This segment announced restructuring actions in 2009, along with plant shut-downs, furloughs and mandatory vacation across the operation. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $89 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits of $84 million and fixed asset impairments of $5 million. Including these special items, 2009 operating income was $1.3 billion and operating income margins were 17.4 percent. This segment recorded $66 million related to restructuring and exit activities in 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2005, 3M&#146;s automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of TI&#38;M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&#38;M) for approximately $55 million. TI&#38;M is the parent company of I&#38;T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&#38;T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed the firm&#146;s flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&#38;T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&#38;M, the Company was granted a put option, which gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&#38;M to the other investors from whom 3M acquired its 19 percent interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&#38;M investors from whom 3M purchased its shares have filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria. The Company expects to recover approximately $8.7 million through the bankruptcy process and is pursuing recovery of the balance of its investment, first, from the sellers&#146; bank and, to extent not made whole, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care Business (17.0% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,521 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,294 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,303 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n3.6 \n\n% \n\n6.7 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.8 \n\n) \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n% \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\n8.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,364 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,350 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,175 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\n14.9 \n\n% \n\n(37.6 \n\n)% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n30.2 \n\n% \n\n31.4 \n\n% \n\n27.3 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Health Care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information systems. Products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, inhalation and transdermal drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products (oral care), health information systems, and food safety products. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2010 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care local-currency sales increased 5.2 percent, including a benefit of 1.2 percent from acquisitions, primarily related to the Arizant Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter. Arizant Inc. is a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia in surgical settings. Currency impacts increased sales by 0.3 percent. On a geographic basis, all regions posted positive local-currency sales growth, led by Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada. Local currency sales growth was broad-based, led by skin and wound care, drug delivery systems, health information systems, infection prevention and oral care. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income increased 1.0 percent to $1.4 billion, and operating income margins were 30.2 percent. Health Care recorded charges of $20 million related to restructuring actions in 2009, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. Lower year-on-year H1N1-related sales penalized both sales and operating income in 2010. 3M&#146;s long-term expectation is that operating income margins will be in the high 20&#146;s, as 3M continues to invest to grow this business. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, sales were $4.3 billion, up 3.6 percent in local currencies. This growth was broad-based, with positive contributions from nearly all businesses. Sales growth was led by the infection prevention and skin and wound care businesses, which provide a multitude of products that improve patient treatment outcomes and increase efficiency for health care providers. 3M also drove positive local-currency sales growth in the oral care business. On a geographic basis, sales growth rates were highest in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada. \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care recorded charges of $20 million related to restructuring actions in 2009, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. In 2008, this business segment recorded charges of $60 million related to restructuring and exit activities, primarily comprised of severance and related benefits, but also including $14 million in asset impairments. Including these charges, full-year operating income in Health Care grew 15 percent to $1.35 billion, with operating income margins of 31.4 percent in 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDisplay and Graphics Business (14.6% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,884 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,132 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,268 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n23.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.6 \n\n)% \n\n(18.0 \n\n)% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n23.0 \n\n% \n\n(2.8 \n\n) % \n\n(17.9 \n\n)% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 \n\n% \n\n(4.2 \n\n) % \n\n(16.6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n60.3 \n\n% \n\n1.3 \n\n% \n\n(50.0 \n\n)% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n24.4 \n\n% \n\n18.8 \n\n% \n\n17.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film solutions for LCD electronic displays; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; commercial graphics sheeting and systems; and mobile interactive solutions, including mobile display technology, visual systems products, and computer privacy filters. The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3M&#146;s optical film patents begin to expire in the next few years, 3M will likely see more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3M&#146;s proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2010 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Display and Graphics were $3.9 billion, up 24.0 percent year-on-year. Sales increased 23.0 percent in local currencies, which was entirely organic. Foreign currency impacts increased sales growth by 1.0 percent. Sales rose in all businesses, with the strongest growth in 3M&#146;s optical systems and commercial graphics businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2010, while sales growth moderated in optical films for LCD TVs, local-currency sales were still up more than 10 percent year-on-year. Sales in 2010 were up slightly in the traffic safety systems business and mobile interactive solutions division, which focuses on products that improve projection, personalization and privacy for mobile device users. Geographically, sales growth was led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2010 totaled $946 million, or 24.4 percent of sales. In 2009, this business segment recorded net charges of $22 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits and fixed asset impairments. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, sales in Display and Graphics declined 4 percent to $3.1 billion, and operating income increased 1.3 percent to $590 million. Sales grew in traffic safety systems and optical systems, but declined in commercial graphics as the global recession significantly slowed spending on corporate advertising. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, operating income margins were 18.8 percent, negatively impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to net restructuring charges of $22 million. This net aggregate charge included fixed asset impairments of $13 million and employee-related severance/benefits/other of $9 million, which is recorded net of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges. In 2008, restructuring charges and exit activities reduced operating income by $42 million.

Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products (do-it-yourself), home care products, protective material products, certain consumer retail personal safety products, and consumer health care products. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2010 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Consumer and Office increased 11.0 percent in 2010 to $3.9 billion. Local-currency sales increased 10.0 percent, which included 7.1 percent from organic growth and 2.9 percent from acquisitions. Acquisition growth for 2010 was primarily comprised of the July 2009 acquisition of ACE&#174; and related brands, which sells elastic bandage, supports and thermometer product lines through consumer channels in North America, and the April 2010 acquisition of the A-One branded label business. In addition, the January 2010 acquisition of Incavas Industria de Cabos e Vassouras Ltda., a manufacturer of floor care products, contributed to acquisition sales growth. Foreign currency impacts added 1.0 percent to sales growth. \n\n&#160; \n\n2010 sales growth was broad-based, led by office supply products, consumer health care, home care, do-it-yourself products and stationery products. On a geographic basis, sales growth was led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada and the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer and Office operating income increased 12.3 percent to $840 million, with operating income margins of 21.8 percent. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $13 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, sales declined 3.0 percent to $3.5 billion, partially due to organic volume declines of 3.1 percent, driven by lower spending by both retail consumers and commercial customers for most of the year. In addition, currency effects decreased sales growth by 2.5 percent. Acquisitions contributed 2.6 percent to 2009 local-currency sales, largely related to two purchases. In December 2008, 3M purchased Futuro, a leading supplier of braces, supports and compression hosiery. In July 2009, 3M purchased ACE&#174; Products, one of the strong consumer health care brands, from Becton, Dickinson and Company. These investments, combined with 3M&#146;s own successful brands, provide critical mass in the retail drug store channel. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income margins were at 21.5 percent for the year, up over 2 percentage points versus 2008. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $13 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. 2008 includes $18 million in restructuring charges. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety, Security and Protection Services Business (12.4% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,308 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,064 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,330 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n6.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.0 \n\n) \n\n4.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n7.5 \n\n% \n\n(2.7 \n\n)% \n\n15.2 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.9 \n\n) \n\n(1.8 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.4 \n\n) \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n8.0 \n\n% \n\n(8.0 \n\n)% \n\n15.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4 \n\n)% \n\n5.1 \n\n% \n\n20.3 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.4 \n\n% \n\n23.6 \n\n% \n\n20.7 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, safety and security products (including border and civil security solutions), cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, track and trace solutions, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles. In the second quarter of 2008, 3M completed the sale of its HighJump Software business which provided supply chain execution software solutions. 3M&#146;s Track and Trace Solutions utilize radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to provide a growing array of solutions &#151; from library patron self-checkout systems to tracking packages. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2010 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety, Security and Protection Services sales increased 8.0 percent in 2010. Local-currency sales growth was 7.5 percent, which included a 1.2 percent benefit from acquisitions. Foreign exchange impacts added 0.5 percent to sales. The acquisition benefit primarily related to two fourth-quarter 2010 acquisitions, namely Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. Attenti Holdings S.A. is a supplier of remote people-monitoring technologies used for offender-monitoring applications and to assist eldercare facilities in monitoring and enhancing the safety of patients. Cogent Inc. is a provider of finger, palm, face and iris biometric systems for governments, law enforcement agencies, and commercial enterprises. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s security systems business led 2010 sales growth, helped by strong organic volume and acquisition growth (Cogent Inc.) that drove local-currency growth of nearly 50 percent. Corrosion protection products, track and trace products (helped by acquisition growth related to Attenti Holdings S.A.) and building and commercial services also were strong contributors to sales growth. Sales of personal protection products increased in 2010, despite negative year-on-year impacts from H1N1. Industrial minerals sales also increased for the year, helped by a strong fourth quarter of 2010. Geographically, local-currency sales growth was broad-based, led by Latin America and Asia Pacific. Europe/Middle East Africa sales growth was led by Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income for 2010 was $707 million, with a 21.4 percent operating income margin. Operating income declined 2.4 percent, penalized by year-on-year H1N1-related comparisons, which reduced Safety, Security and Protection Services sales growth rates by approximately 6 percent year-on-year. In addition, fourth-quarter 2010 acquisition-related costs also penalized operating income. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $16 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. This charge was largely offset by a gain of $15 million related to the sale of 3M&#146;s New Jersey roofing granule facility. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, sales in Safety, Security and Protection Services totaled $3.1 billion, down 8.0 percent in dollar-terms and 2.7 percent in local currencies. 3M drove positive local-currency growth in personal protection products, but all other businesses posted declines for the full year. The global economic downturn negatively impacted the industrial and construction-related businesses within this segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nDespite the 8 percent sales decline for the year, operating income margins rose to 23.6 percent. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $16 million related to restructuring actions, comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. This charge was partially offset by a gain of $15 million related to the sale of \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s New Jersey roofing granule facility. In the second quarter of 2008, 3M completed the sale of its HighJump Software business and recognized a pre-tax loss of $23 million. In addition, 3M recorded restructuring charges and exit activities that totaled $15 million in 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2009, 3M&#146;s Security Systems Division was notified that the UK government decided to award its passport production to a competitor upon the expiration of 3M&#146;s existing UK passport contract in October 2010.

Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, micro interconnect systems, high-performance fluids, high-temperature and display tapes, telecommunications products, electrical products, and touch screens and touch monitors. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2010 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nElectro and Communications sales were $2.9 billion in 2010, an increase of 28.4 percent in U.S. dollars and 27.0 percent in local currency. Foreign currency impacts added 1.9 percent to 2010 sales growth, while divestiture impacts reduced sales by 0.5 percent. Sales expanded in all geographic regions, led by Asia Pacific and the United States. Sales growth was led by the electronics markets materials, electronic solutions and touch systems businesses, which each had local-currency sales growth of greater than 25 percent. 3M also saw strong growth in the electrical markets business. 3M&#146;s telecom infrastructure-related business increased slightly year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income was $631 million in 2010, or 21.6 percent of sales, which was significantly improved versus last year as the consumer electronic-related businesses showed significant year-on-year improvements. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $11 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, sales were $2.3 billion, down 19.7 percent, with local-currency sales declining 17.8 percent, foreign currency translation reducing sales by 1.7 percent, and divestitures reducing sales by 0.2 percent. The global economic downturn weighed heavily on all businesses, particularly telecom infrastructure, commercial construction and utilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income for the year was $322 million, with operating income margins of 14.2 percent. Operating income in 2009 included charges of $11 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. Operating income in 2008 was impacted by $7 million in restructuring expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M&#146;s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M&#146;s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18. Operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items. In 2009, restructuring actions, partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $194 million, with the largest impact in Europe, Asia Pacific and the United States. In 2008, restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses, which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $269 million, with the largest impact in the United States and Europe . \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of key information and discussion related to 3M&#146;s geographic areas follow: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America/ Canada \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Unallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,210 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,259 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,259 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,950 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(16 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n26,662 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n34.5 \n\n% \n\n31.0 \n\n% \n\n23.5 \n\n% \n\n11.0 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n7.0 \n\n% \n\n30.3 \n\n% \n\n7.4 \n\n% \n\n12.1 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n13.7 \n\n% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.6 \n\n) \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n) \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n7.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n28.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n7.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n13.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n13.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n8.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n29.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n7.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n14.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n) \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n8.2 \n\n% \n\n34.9 \n\n% \n\n4.8 \n\n% \n\n17.2 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,636 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,400 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,112 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(27 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n5,918 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\n57.1 \n\n% \n\n10.9 \n\n% \n\n26.5 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n22.9 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor total year 2010, as shown in the preceding table, sales rose 15.3 percent, driven largely by organic volume increases of 13.7 percent.

For 2010, international operations represented nearly two-thirds of 3M&#146;s sales. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America/ Canada \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Unallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,120 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,972 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,516 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,123 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n36.8 \n\n% \n\n26.5 \n\n% \n\n25.8 \n\n% \n\n10.9 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n(11.9 \n\n)% \n\n(3.4 \n\n)% \n\n(11.9 \n\n)% \n\n(10.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(9.5 \n\n)% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n) \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(9.4 \n\n) \n\n(5.3 \n\n) \n\n(10.0 \n\n) \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.7 \n\n) \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n7.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.8 \n\n) \n\n(6.5 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.6 \n\n) \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.4 \n\n) \n\n(7.6 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n) \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.3 \n\n)% \n\n(4.7 \n\n)% \n\n(14.0 \n\n)% \n\n(7.6 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(8.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,640 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,814 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n3.9 \n\n% \n\n(8.1 \n\n)% \n\n(22.5 \n\n)% \n\n(9.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.7 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor total year 2009, as shown in the preceding table, all major geographic areas showed sales declines; however, year-on-year sales growth improved each quarter throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2009, sales growth of 11.1 percent was broad-based. Every major geographic region expanded sales, with strong performances in Asia Pacific at 22 percent and Latin America and Canada each at 19 percent. With respect to organic volume, Asia Pacific led the way at nearly 19 percent for the fourth quarter. Korea, China and Taiwan posted the most significant increases, driven by a combination of improved local demand along with the pickup in global electronics. Organic volumes were flat to slightly down in other geographic regions, which is an improvement versus the levels of decline seen in the first three quarters of 2009. For 2009, international operations represented approximately 63 percent of 3M&#146;s sales. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeographic Area Supplemental Information \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployees as of December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions, except Employees) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\n32,955 \n\n&#160; \n\n31,513 \n\n&#160; \n\n33,662 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,888 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,809 \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\n16,324 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,834 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,960 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,605 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,366 \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East &#160; and Africa \n\n&#160; \n\n18,120 \n\n&#160; \n\n17,743 \n\n&#160; \n\n19,185 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,239 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,318 \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America and Canada \n\n&#160; \n\n12,658 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,376 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Company \n\n&#160; \n\n80,057 \n\n&#160; \n\n74,835 \n\n&#160; \n\n79,183 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,091 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,471 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,279 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nEmployment: \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2010, employment increased by 5,222 positions since year-end 2009, largely driven by acquisitions (estimated 1,850 full-time equivalents) and additions in developing economies. At December 31, 2009, employment declined by 4,348 positions since year-end 2008, largely driven by restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe bulk of 3M capital spending historically has been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the United States. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately two-thirds of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States, helping to improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements. Capital expenditures were $1.091 billion in 2010, compared to $903 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nmillion in 2009 and $1.471 billion in 2008. In response to global economic conditions, the Company reduced its capital spending significantly in 2009. A substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations. The Company expects 2011 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 to $1.4 billion as 3M continues to fund growth opportunities around the world. \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company&#146;s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\nLegal Proceedings: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled &#147;Process for Disclosure of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings&#148; (contained in &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; in Note 14) for additional information about such estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation &#151; Retirement Benefits , in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders&#146; equity. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant&#146;s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.23% for U.S. pension and 5.09% for U.S. postretirement to be appropriate as of December 31, 2010, which is a decrease from the 5.77% and 5.62% rates, respectively, used as of December 31, 2009. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of December 31, 2010 was 5.04%, a decrease from the 5.30% rate used as of December 31, 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\nA significant element in determining the Company&#146;s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2011 is 8.50%, the same as 2010. Refer to Note 11 for information on how the 2011 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nallocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 6.58% for 2011, comparable to the weighted average expected return of 6.90% for 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized total consolidated pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $322 million, up from $223 million in 2009. Pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $535 million in 2011, an increase of $213 million compared to 2010. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease/increase 2011 pension expense by approximately $27 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $11 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2011 pension expense by approximately $30 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $10 million for international pension plans. In addition, a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2011 pension expense by approximately $31 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $20 million for international pension plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nAsset Impairments: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, net property, plant and equipment totaled $7.3 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.8 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Impairments recorded in 2009 and 2008 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in Note 4. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2009, 3M&#146;s Security Systems Division (within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment) was notified that the UK government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3M&#146;s existing UK passport contracts in October 2010. As a result of this event, in June 2009, 3M tested the long lived assets associated with the UK passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives. In addition, 3M tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit (Security Systems Division) level. The result of the June 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the UK passport activity indicated that the asset grouping&#146;s carrying amount of approximately $54 million (before impairment) exceeded the remaining expected cash flows. Accordingly, 3M recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value. In addition, accelerated depreciation/amortization was taken over the period June 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2010. 3M&#146;s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year, using September 30 net book values. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3M has six business segments at December 31, 2010), but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. \n\n&#160; \n\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2010, 3M made certain product moves between its business segments. For those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nthis new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2010 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2010, 3M had 38 primary reporting units, with eight reporting units accounting for approximately 71 percent of the goodwill. These eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M Purification Inc., Occupational Health and Environmental Safety, Optical Systems, 3M ESPE, Communication Markets, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Security Systems, and Health Information Systems. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair values for the majority of reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent. The fair values for Optical Systems and 3M Purification Inc., based on fourth quarter 2010 testing, were in excess of carrying value by approximately 23 percent and 26 percent, respectively, with no impairment indicated. As part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for Optical Systems and 3M Purification Inc., using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management&#146;s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. In the fourth quarter of 2010, 3M made several larger acquisitions. These acquisitions (with their reporting unit indicated) included Arizant Inc. (Infection Prevention), Cogent Inc. (Security Systems) and Attenti Holdings S.A. (Track and Trace), with goodwill of approximately $512 million, $295 million and $122 million, respectively. Due to the significance of the Cogent Inc. acquisition with respect to its reporting unit, 3M will be monitoring the Security Systems Division in 2011 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, for those reporting units whose fair value was in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units. Based on the fair values determined using discounted cash flows for certain reporting units and the industry price-earnings ratio approach for the remaining reporting units, at September 30, 2010, 3M&#146;s implied control premium was approximately 23 percent. The control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3M&#146;s total Company market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total Company. At September 30, 2010, 3M&#146;s market value was approximately $62 billion, but if each reporting unit was valued individually, 3M&#146;s market value would be approximately $76 billion using a 23 percent control premium. 3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus; many of 3M&#146;s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. Based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2010, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. In addition, 3M&#146;s market value at both September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010 of approximately $62 billion and $61 billion, respectively, was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $16 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges, among others, include changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148;, of this document. As of December 31, 2010, 3M had approximately $1 billion of goodwill related to 3M Purification Inc. and $750 million related to Optical Systems. In addition, as a result of the Cogent Inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2010, Security Systems Division goodwill increased to approximately $500 million. If future non-cash impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2011 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe extent of 3M&#146;s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company&#146;s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company&#146;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \n\n&#160; \n\nAs indicated in the following table, at December 31, 2010, 3M had $5.018 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $5.452 billion of debt. Debt included $4.183 billion of long-term debt, $1.185 billion related to the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings of $84 million. The strength of 3M&#146;s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3M reliable access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company&#146;s maturity profile is staggered to ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company generates significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to fund share repurchase activities, pay dividends on 3M common stock, and for acquisitions. As discussed in Note 2, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company purchased Arizant Inc., Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc. As a result, cash outflows (including repayment of acquired debt, but net of cash and marketable securities acquired) for these three acquisitions totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 3M was able to complete these acquisitions without incurring additional debt, while maintaining a strong cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,452 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,710 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,718 \n\n&#160; \n\nLess: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; \n\n5,018 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,574 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,101 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations. This measure is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately $5.0 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of $5.2 billion. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company&#146;s stock. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $6.126 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $5.898 billion at December 31, 2009. Working capital increases were primarily attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and inventories, which were largely offset by decreases in working capital driven by increases in current liabilities, primarily short-term debt and accounts payable. \n\n&#160; \n\nPrimary short-term liquidity needs are met through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. The Company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3M to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, 3M had no outstanding commercial paper. The Company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Effective April 30, 2007, the Company has a $1.5-billion five-year credit facility, which has provisions for the Company to request an increase of the facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders&#146; discretion), and providing for up to $150 million in letters of credit. At December 31, 2010, available short-term committed lines of credit, including the preceding $1.5 billion five-year credit facility, totaled approximately $1.674 billion worldwide, of which approximately $255 million was utilized in connection with normal business activities. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has a &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; shelf registration statement, effective February 17, 2009, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. No securities have been issued under \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nthis shelf. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. In connection with a prior &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; shelf registration, in June 2007 the Company established a $3 billion medium-term notes program. Three debt securities have been issued under this medium-term notes program. First, in December 2007, 3M issued a five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65%. Second, in August 2008, 3M issued a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375%. Third, in October 2008, the Company issued a three-year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.50%. The Company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this $800 million note to a floating rate. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. The Company&#146;s $350 million of Dealer Remarketable Securities had ratings triggers (BBB-/Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. These securities were retired upon maturity in December 2010. In addition, under the $1.5-billion five-year credit facility agreement, 3M is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2010, this ratio was approximately 35 to 1. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2010 totaled $3.377 billion, with an additional $1.641 billion in current and long-term marketable securities. 3M&#146;s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.5 billion in 2010, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2011, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 4.8 percent to 55 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.20 per share. In February 2011, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, replacing the Company&#146;s existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2011, the Company expects to contribute in cash an amount in the range of $400 million to $600 million to its U.S. and international pension and postretirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2011. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. qualified plans&#146; funded status as of the 2011 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales &#151; fourth quarter at year-end &#151; multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.3 at December 31, 2010, a decline from 5.5 at December 31, 2009. Receivables increased $365 million, or 11.2 percent, compared with December 31, 2009, with higher December 2010 sales compared to December 2009 sales contributing to this increase. In addition, acquisitions increased accounts receivable by $93 million and currency translation increased accounts receivable by $82 million, as the U.S. dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies. Inventories increased $516 million, or 19.6 percent, compared with December 31, 2009. The inventory increases are partially attributable to the increase in demand in 2010. In addition, acquisitions increased inventories by $77 million year-on-year, while currency translation increased inventories by $35 million. Accounts payable increased $209 million compared with December 31, 2009, with acquisitions accounting for $46 million of this increase and currency translation accounting for $16 million, with the balance primarily related to improvement in business activity. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income including noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,163 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,244 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,520 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n1,120 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,157 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,153 \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany pension contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(556 \n\n) \n\n(659 \n\n) \n\n(421 \n\n) \n\nCompany postretirement contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(62 \n\n) \n\n(133 \n\n) \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\nCompany pension expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany postretirement expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLoss/(gain) from sale of businesses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(44 \n\n) \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n(21 \n\n) \n\nAccounts receivable \n\n&#160; \n\n(189 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n(404 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(127 \n\n) \n\nAccounts payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(224 \n\n) \n\nProduct and other insurance receivables and claims \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(329 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,533 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, which is considered a non-cash financing activity. This non-cash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $233 million compared to 2009. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. Operating cash flows were penalized by working capital increases of $447 million in 2010, compared to working capital decreases of $617 million in 2009. 3M defines working capital as accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. These working capital increases were partially attributable to the rapid increase in demand in 2010. In addition, operating cash flows in 2009 benefited from changes in deferred and accrued income taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $408 million compared to 2008. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to working capital decreases of $617 million in 2009, compared to working capital increases of $154 million in 2008. 3M defines working capital as accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. In addition, 3M&#146;s deferred and accrued income tax positions benefited 2009 cash flows. These positive contributions were partially offset by a decrease of $276 million in net income including noncontrolling interest. The category, &#147;Other-net,&#148; in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts. This includes the impact of cash outlays for restructuring payments, net of restructuring expenses, which on a combined basis reduced liabilities (Note 4). In addition, decreases in banked vacation accruals reduced liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure): \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. Below find a recap of free cash flow for 2010, 2009 and 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,533 \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,091 \n\n) \n\n(903 \n\n) \n\n(1,471 \n\n) \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,083 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,038 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,062 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,091 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(903 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,471 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from sale of PP&#38;E and other assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,830 \n\n) \n\n(69 \n\n) \n\n(1,394 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from sale of businesses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(839 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(66 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,689 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,732 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,399 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending increased to $1.091 billion in 2010, compared to $903 million in 2009. In 2010, in the U.S., 3M invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non-optical businesses which use similar technology. In Singapore, 3M is increasing capacity at its multi-purpose manufacturing facility. 3M investments in the Industrial and Transportation business included solar energy in the U.S. and industrial adhesives and tapes in China. 3M also invested in optical film capacity in Korea. Capital spending on some of the preceding projects will carry over into 2011. The Company expects 2011 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 to $1.4 billion as 3M continues to fund growth opportunities around the world. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn response to global economic conditions, the Company reduced its capital spending significantly in 2009. A substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations. In 2008, major facility efforts included completion of production lines in the United States for both Consumer and Office and Health Care, an R&#38;D laboratory in Korea, a tape building in Poland, and numerous tape lines and building expansions in China. In 2008, 3M also made progress towards completion of investments in a Singapore multi-purpose manufacturing facility and film production facilities and made progress towards completion of manufacturing cost reduction investments in two of its U.S. film manufacturing plants. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions. Note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. The coupon interest rates for asset-backed securities are either fixed rate or floating. Floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly LIBOR rate. Each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective LIBOR rate +/- an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. Terms of the reset are \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nunique to individual securities. Fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond. The spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3M&#146;s diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $1.641 billion as of December 31, 2010. Additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Notes 6 and 10, during the quarter ended March 31, 2010, the Company&#146;s majority owned Sumitomo 3M Limited entity (Sumitomo 3M) purchased a portion of its shares held by its noncontrolling interest, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI), by paying cash of 5.8 billion Japanese Yen and entering into a note payable to SEI of 17.4 billion Japanese Yen (approximately $63 million and $188 million, respectively, based on applicable exchange rates at that time). The cash paid of approximately $63 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 as a result of the purchase of Sumitomo 3M shares from SEI is classified as &#147;Other investing activities&#148; in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The remainder of the purchase financed by the note payable to SEI is considered non-cash investing and financing activity in the first quarter of 2010. As discussed in Note 10, during the second quarter of 2010, 3M recorded a financed liability of 1.7 billion Japanese yen (approximately $18 million based on applicable exchange rates at that time), which is also considered a non-cash investing and financing activity. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in short-term debt &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(24 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(536 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nRepayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) \n\n&#160; \n\n(556 \n\n) \n\n(519 \n\n) \n\n(1,080 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,756 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal cash change in debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(472 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,014 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n1,037 \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of treasury stock \n\n&#160; \n\n(854 \n\n) \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n(1,631 \n\n) \n\nReissuances of treasury stock \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDividends paid to shareholders \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,500 \n\n) \n\n(1,431 \n\n) \n\n(1,398 \n\n) \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests and other &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(84 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,121 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,014 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,766 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nTotal debt at December 31, 2010 was $5.5 billion, compared to $5.7 billion at year-end 2009 and $6.7 billion at year-end 2008. Debt was higher at year-end 2008 as the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the U.S. given the difficult market environment at that point in time. Total debt was 25 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2010, compared with 30 percent at year-end 2009, and 39 percent at year-end 2008. The net change in short-term debt is typically due to commercial paper activity. In 2010, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included repayment of $350 million in Dealer Remarketable Securities, which matured in December 2010, and repayment of a portion of debt related to the 5.8 billion Japanese Yen installment paid on September 30, 2010 (refer to Notes 6 and 10 for more detail). In addition, approximately $105 million in acquired debt related to 2010 acquisitions was subsequently repaid. In 2009, repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) includes a $400 million medium-term note that matured in November 2009 and also includes repayments of commercial paper. In 2008, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days primarily represents debt acquired upon the acquisition of Aearo that was immediately repaid and repayment of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days. In 2010, proceeds from debt primarily include a 100.5 million Canadian Dollar loan. In 2008, proceeds from debt primarily include a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note issued in August 2008 with a coupon rate of 4.375%, and a three-year, $800 million, fixed rate note issued in October 2008 with a coupon rate of 4.5% (refer to Note 10 for more information). \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company&#146;s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2011, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, replacing the Company&#146;s existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2010, the Company purchased $854 million in shares, while in 2009 purchases were minimal as the Company had no broker purchases of treasury stock. In 2008, the Company purchased $1.6 billion in shares. For more information, refer to the table titled &#147;Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148; in Part II, Item 5. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $1.5 billion ($2.10 per share) in 2010, $1.431 billion ($2.04 per share) in 2009 and $1.398 billion ($2.00 per share) in 2008. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2011, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 4.8 percent to 55 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.20 per share. This marked the 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases. Other cash flows from financing activities primarily include distributions to noncontrolling interests, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Warranties/Guarantees&#148; in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M&#146;s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of the Company&#146;s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments due by year \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt, including current portion (Note 10) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,368 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,185 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,413 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,096 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest on long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n1,909 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,182 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital leases (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations and other \n\n&#160; \n\n1,238 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual cash obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,068 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,438 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,207 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,634 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,420 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nLong-term debt payments due in 2011 include $160 million of floating rate notes. The floating rate notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Additionally, payments due in 2012 include the $226 million carrying amount of Convertible Notes, and payments due in 2013 include $73 million of floating rate notes, as a result of put provisions. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company&#146;s expected capital spending in 2011 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M&#146;s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled &#147;Unconditional purchase obligations and other,&#148; include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $352 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 8 for further details. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2011 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2011 and future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Company&#146;s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nA Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the Company&#146;s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after-tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2010. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The model used analyzed 18 currencies, interest rates related to three currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. Foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2010, primarily due to increases in exposures, which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model. Interest rate volatility decreased in 2010 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low, based on forward rates. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAdverse impact on \n\n&#160; \n\nPositive impact on \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nafter-tax earnings \n\n&#160; \n\nafter-tax earnings \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign exchange rates \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(108 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(81 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rates \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommodity rates \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n(20 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $62 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $38 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 212, "Negative": 283, "Polarity": -0.1434343431445771, "Subjectivity": 0.06120178040786328}, "similarity_score": 0.9917154026905461, "nlp_result": 0.027173436122384632}
