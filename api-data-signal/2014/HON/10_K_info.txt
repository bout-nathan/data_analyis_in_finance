Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe following Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2014. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nIn April 2014, the Company announced the realignment of our Honeywell Process Solutions business from Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) into Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT). The Company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of Honeywell Process Solutions in Performance Materials and Technologies for all periods presented. \n\nIn July 2014, following the closing of the sale of its Friction Materials business, the Company announced the realignment of its Transportation Systems business segment with its Aerospace business segment. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company has three business segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies. The Company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of Transportation Systems in Aerospace for all periods presented. \n\nThese realignments have no impact on the Company&#146;s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nFor Honeywell, 2014 represented a year of strong performance despite a continued slow growth global environment. Honeywell&#146;s 2014 revenues were $40.3 billion representing a 3% improvement compared to 2013 revenues of $39.1 billion. Our segment profit improved by 5%, more than one and one-half times revenue growth, evidencing the Company&#146;s continued focus on operational excellence. We achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on effective repositioning. The Company&#146;s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes, the Honeywell Enablers, which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. We continued to execute on our key strategies for growth including penetration of high growth regions and investments in high return capital expenditures and new products and technologies, while maintaining our cost disciplines and leveraging the Honeywell Enablers. \n\nThe Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; R&#38;D spending at 4.7% of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, avionics equipment and technology, connected voice and wireless control devices and technologies, software and mobile app development and data science to deliver value. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures of $1,094 million (in addition to $947 million in 2013) principally related to the construction and expansion of Aerospace and PMT manufacturing facilities, as well as continued investment in our ACS facilities. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; The Company recognized $184 million of charges relating to repositioning actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; The Company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses to ensure they fit our long-term strategic plan. In 2014, the Company sold its Friction Materials business for approximately $155 million. In addition, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Datamax-O&#146;Neil, \n\n##TABLE_END 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers, for $185 million (the transaction is expected to close in early 2015). \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Expansion of Honeywell&#146;s presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Sales to customers outside the United States increased by 5% in 2014 and now account for approximately 55% of total revenues. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Operating cash flow grew by 16% in 2014 to $5,024 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $1,094 million in capital expenditures, repay $600 million in long-term debt, provide a 15% increase in the Company&#146;s cash dividend rate (vs. 2013) and repurchase 10.0 million shares of common stock. \n\n##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nNet Sales \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $100 million to $125 million in 2015 compared with 2014 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $161 million, $160 million and $136 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2015, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $150 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2014, a substantial portion of the Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. \n\nA source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.60% and 0.79%, respectively. \n\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2014, Standard and Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P), Fitch, and Moody&#146;s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. S&#38;P, Fitch and Moody&#146;s have Honeywell&#146;s rating outlook as &#147;stable&#148;. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n\nOn December 10, 2013, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (&#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement. \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring 2014, the Company repurchased $924 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $4.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases. \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. \n\nSpecifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2015 to be as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures&#151;we expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion for capital expenditures in 2015 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Share repurchases&#151;under the Company&#146;s share repurchase program, $4.1 billion is available as of December 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Dividends&#151;we increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5175 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2014 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2015. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Asbestos claims&#151;we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $350 million and $30 million, respectively, in 2015. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Pension contributions&#151;in 2015, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $140 million ($109 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2015) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Repositioning actions&#151;we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $150 million in 2015. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Environmental remediation costs&#151;we expect to spend approximately $275 million in 2015 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. \n\n##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2014 and 2013, we realized $160 million and $3 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. \n\n&#160;\n\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2014: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Total(6) \n\n&#160; Payments by Period \n\n&#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; 2015 \n\n&#160; 2016- 2017 \n\n&#160; 2018- 2019 \n\nLong-term debt, including capitalized leases(1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,985 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,807 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,277 \n\n&#160; Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3,349 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 303 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 552 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 414 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2,080 \n\n&#160; Minimum operating lease payments \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,281 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 330 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 470 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 224 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 257 \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations(2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,643 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 953 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 472 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 158 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 60 \n\n&#160; Estimated environmental liability payments(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 591 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 278 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 218 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 75 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 20 \n\n&#160; Asbestos related liability payments(4) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,552 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 352 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 737 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 413 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 50 \n\n&#160; Asbestos insurance recoveries(5) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (485 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (31 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (112 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (105 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (237 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n14,916 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,124 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,299 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,986 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,507 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; (1) \n\n&#160; Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n&#160; (2) \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n&#160; (3) \n\n&#160; The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2014. \n\n&#160; (4) \n\n&#160; These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2014.

In addition, in both 2014 and 2013 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nSpending related to known environmental matters was $321 million, $304 million and $320 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $275 million in 2015. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments \n\n&#160;\n\nbased on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2014 and 2013. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Face or Notional Amount \n\n&#160; Carrying Value(1) \n\n&#160; Fair Value(1) \n\n&#160; Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value(2) \n\nDecember 31, 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,985 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,985 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,817 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(478 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,100 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 93 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 93 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (69 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7,291 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 10 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 10 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 86 \n\n&#160; December 31, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n7,433 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,433 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,066 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(466 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,700 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 55 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 55 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (77 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7,298 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 296 \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; (1) \n\n&#160; Asset or (liability). \n\n&#160; (2) \n\n&#160; A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. \n\n&#160; (3) \n\n&#160; Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#151;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of \n\n&#160;\n\nmanagement&#146;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. \n\nAsbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries &#151;Honeywell&#146;s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#151;We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense). \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our 2014, 2013 and 2012 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2014 \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; 2012 \n\nDiscount rate \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.89 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.06 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.89 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 23 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 13 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the \n\n&#160;\n\nvarious assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $249 million, $51 million and $957 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. \n\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2015 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan&#146;s investments. \n\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.08% discount rate in 2015, reflecting the significant decline in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in Assumption \n\n&#160; Impact on 2015 Pension Ongoing Expense \n\n&#160; Impact on PBO \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate \n\n&#160; Decrease $14 million \n\n&#160; Increase $542 million \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate \n\n&#160; Increase $13 million \n\n&#160; Decrease $515 million \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Increase $41 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Decrease $41 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $385 million in 2015 compared with pension ongoing income of $254 million in 2014. The increase in pension ongoing income in 2015 compared with 2014 results primarily from lower interest cost due to a decline in discount rates at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 and an increase in the plans&#146; assets at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2014. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2015, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nLong-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) &#151;The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n##TABLE_END 30 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant negative industry or economic trends; or \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing &#151;In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. \n\nIncome Taxes &#151;On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#151;In 2014, we recognized approximately 15% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Aerospace, ACS and PMT segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters. \n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 115, "Negative": 149, "Polarity": -0.12878787830004593, "Subjectivity": 0.056253995300180264}, "similarity_score": 0.9963609302981888, "nlp_result": 0}
