&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following discussions of the Company's net income and segment operating income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment operating income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis. \n\nOverview \n\nDiluted net income per share of $10.70 in 2014 increased by 10% over diluted net income per share of $9.74 in 2013. Net income of $3.69 billion in 2014 increased slightly over net income of $3.67 billion in 2013. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The slight increase in net income was primarily driven by the pretax impacts of (i) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\"), (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) higher net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses, (v) a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter in 2013 and (vi) lower net realized investment gains. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $709 million and $591 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was \n\n$941 million and $840 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the Company's business segments, (ii) lower reinsurance costs and (iii) a 2014 reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments to be paid by the Company related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iv) an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (v) a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of a $63 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013. \n\nDiluted net income per share of $9.74 in 2013 increased by 55% over diluted net income per share of $6.30 in 2012. Net income of $3.67 billion in 2013 increased by 49% over net income of $2.47 billion in 2012. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in 2013 and 2012. The increase in net income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii) an increase in net realized investment gains and (iv) an increase in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, partially offset by (v) lower net investment income and (vi) lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $591 million and $1.86 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $840 million and $940 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the Company's business segments. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2014 were $23.71 billion, $1.08 billion or 5% higher than in 2013. The increase in earned premiums in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of Dominion on November 1, 2013. In the Business and International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 9% over 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. In the Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 5% over 2013. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 decreased by 3% from 2013. \n\nEarned premiums in 2013 were $22.64 billion, $280 million or 1% higher than in 2012. In the Business and International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 4% over 2012. In the Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 1% over 2012. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 decreased by 4% from 2012. \n\nFactors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments. \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Average investments(1) &#160; $ 72,049 &#160; $ 70,697 &#160; $ 69,863 &#160; Pretax net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,787 &#160; &#160; 2,716 &#160; &#160; 2,889 &#160; After-tax net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,216 &#160; &#160; 2,186 &#160; &#160; 2,316 &#160; Average pretax yield(2) &#160; &#160; 3.9 % &#160; 3.8 % &#160; 4.1 % Average after-tax yield(2) &#160; &#160; 3.1 % &#160; 3.1 % &#160; 3.3 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income.

Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $2.24 billion, $66 million lower than in 2013, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $573 million, $141 million higher than in 2013, primarily driven by higher returns from the Company's private equity investments, as well as higher returns from real estate partnership investments. \n\nNet investment income in 2013 was $2.72 billion, $173 million or 6% lower than in 2012. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2013 was $2.31 billion, $129 million lower than in 2012, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2013 was $432 million, $44 million lower than in 2012, primarily driven by lower returns from the Company's real estate partnership investments. \n\nFee Income \n\nThe National Accounts market in the Business and International Insurance segment is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. The $43 million and $72 million increases in fee income in 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared with the respective prior years are described in the Business and International Insurance segment discussion that follows. \n\nNet Realized Investment Gains \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net pretax realized investment gains. \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Net Realized Investment Gains &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other-than-temporary impairment losses &#160; $ (26 ) $ (15 ) $ (15 ) Other net realized investment gains &#160; &#160; 105 &#160; &#160; 181 &#160; &#160; 66 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net realized investment gains &#160; $ 79 &#160; $ 166 &#160; $ 51 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nOther Net Realized Investment Gains \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2014 included $35 million of net realized gains resulting from the sale of substantially all of one of the Company's real estate joint venture investments. The \n\nremaining $70 million of other net realized gains in 2014 were primarily driven by $32 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $24 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities, $8 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments and $6 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales. \n\nOther net realized gains in 2013 of $181 million were primarily driven by $115 million of net realized gains associated with U.S. Treasury futures contracts, which require daily mark-to-market settlement and are used from time to time to shorten the duration of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. The remaining $66 million of other net realized investment gains in 2013 were primarily driven by $41 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $15 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities and $10 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments. \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2012 of $66 million were primarily driven by $61 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $19 million of net realized investment gains related to real estate and $8 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. These net realized investment gains were partially offset by $14 million of net realized investment losses associated with U.S. Treasury futures contracts and $8 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nThe amount of other revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges. Other revenues in 2013 also included a $91 million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements, and a $20 million gain from the sale of renewal rights related to the Company's National Flood Insurance Program business. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $13.87 billion, $563 million or 4% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting (i) the impact of the acquisition of Dominion, (ii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv) higher catastrophe losses and (v) a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses, partially offset by (vi) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of Dominion) and (vii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2014 included multiple wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States and a winter storm in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. Catastrophe losses in 2013 resulted from multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, as well as floods in Alberta, Canada and Storm Xaver in the United Kingdom. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $13.31 billion, $1.37 billion or 9% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i) a decline in catastrophe losses and (ii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of Dominion), partially offset by (iii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iv) the impact of the acquisition of Dominion and (v) lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2012 primarily resulted from Storm Sandy, as well as multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42 million charge that was precipitated by legislation in New York enacted during the first quarter of 2013 related to the New York Fund for Reopened Cases for workers' compensation. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve \n\ndevelopment in each segment are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nSignificant Catastrophe Losses \n\nThe Company defines a \"catastrophe\" as an event that: \n\n&#149; is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and &#149; the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold. The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is pierced and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. The threshold for 2014 ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes. \n\nThe following table presents for significant catastrophes the amount of losses recorded in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the amount of related net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in subsequent years as well as the estimate of ultimate losses at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Losses Incurred / Unfavorable (Favorable) Prior Year Reserve Development for the Year Ended December 31, &#160; Estimated Ultimate Losses at December 31, &#160; (in millions, pretax and net of reinsurance) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PCS Serial Number: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 67&#151;Severe wind and hail storms &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ (2 ) $ 140 &#160; $ 138 &#160; $ 138 &#160; $ 140 &#160; 74&#151;Severe wind and hail storms &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; (20 ) &#160; 171 &#160; &#160; 152 &#160; &#160; 151 &#160; &#160; 171 &#160; 76&#151;Severe wind and hail storms &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; (10 ) &#160; 148 &#160; &#160; 133 &#160; &#160; 138 &#160; &#160; 148 &#160; 83&#151;Severe wind storms &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 136 &#160; &#160; 137 &#160; &#160; 138 &#160; &#160; 136 &#160; 90&#151;Storm Sandy &#160; &#160; (62 ) &#160; (52 ) &#160; 1,024 &#160; &#160; 910 &#160; &#160; 972 &#160; &#160; 1,024 &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PCS Serial Number: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 93&#151;Severe wind and hail storms &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 114 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; 119 &#160; &#160; 114 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; 15&#151;Severe wind and hail storms &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; 144 &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PCS Serial Number: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 32&#151;Winter storm &#160; &#160; 144 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; 144 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; 43&#151;Severe wind and hail storms &#160; &#160; 180 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; 180 &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; &#160; n/a &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nn/a: not applicable. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $3.88 billion, $61 million or 2% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion, partially offset by declines in the Personal Insurance segment. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $3.82 billion, $89 million or 2% lower than in 2012. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2014 were $3.95 billion, $195 million or 5% higher than in 2013. The increase in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of Dominion and increases in employee and technology related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums. General and administrative expenses in 2013 were $3.76 billion, $147 million or 4% higher than in 2012. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $369 million, $361 million and $378 million, respectively. The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflected slightly higher average levels of debt outstanding. The decline in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected lower average levels of debt outstanding. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2014 was $1.40 billion, $125 million or 10% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a $63 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as the tax effects of the $144 million increase in income before income taxes in 2014. Income tax expense in 2013 was $1.27 billion, $579 million or 84% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of the tax effects of the $1.78 billion increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the $63 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013. \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 27%, 26% and 22% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2013 was reduced by the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters. \n\nCombined Ratio \n\nThe combined ratio of 89.0% in 2014 was 0.8 points lower than the combined ratio of 89.8% in 2013. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.6% in 2014 was 0.3 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.9% in 2013. Catastrophe losses accounted for 3.0 points and 2.6 points of the 2014 and 2013 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 3.9 points and 3.7 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The 2014 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio\") was 0.5 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact of an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 31.4% in 2014 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2013, primarily reflecting lower commission expenses in the Personal Insurance segment and a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums in the Business and International Insurance segment, partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses described above. \n\nThe combined ratio of 89.8% in 2013 was 7.3 points lower than the combined ratio of 97.1% in 2012. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.9% in 2013 was 7.0 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.9% in 2012. Catastrophe losses accounted for 2.6 points and 8.3 points of the 2013 and 2012 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 3.7 points and 4.2 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.8 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the Company's business segments. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2013 was lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of growth in earned premiums in 2013. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Business and International Insurance &#160; $ 16,202 &#160; $ 14,992 &#160; $ 14,327 &#160; Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance &#160; &#160; 2,165 &#160; &#160; 2,131 &#160; &#160; 2,059 &#160; Personal Insurance &#160; &#160; 7,265 &#160; &#160; 7,534 &#160; &#160; 7,923 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 25,632 &#160; $ 24,657 &#160; $ 24,309 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Business and International Insurance &#160; $ 14,636 &#160; $ 13,512 &#160; $ 12,929 &#160; Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance &#160; &#160; 2,103 &#160; &#160; 2,030 &#160; &#160; 1,924 &#160; Personal Insurance &#160; &#160; 7,165 &#160; &#160; 7,225 &#160; &#160; 7,594 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 23,904 &#160; $ 22,767 &#160; $ 22,447 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2014 increased by 4% and 5%, respectively, over 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion.

The decrease in operating income in 2014 primarily reflected an increase in income taxes and a slight decrease in operating income before income taxes. The slight decrease in operating income before income taxes reflected the pretax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter in 2013 and (iii) higher catastrophe losses, largely offset by (iv) higher underlying underwriting margins and (v) an increase in net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $367 million and $333 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $322 million and $399 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins in 2014 primarily reflected (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii) a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments to be paid by the Company related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv) a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the impact of a $43 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. The higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 primarily resulted from the impact of the reduction in income tax expense in 2013 described above. \n\nOperating income in 2013 was $2.40 billion, $423 million or 21% higher than operating income of $1.98 billion in 2012. The increase in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins and (iii) an increase in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter, partially offset by (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) lower net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $333 million and $829 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $399 million and $585 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42 million charge that was precipitated by legislation in New York as described in the consolidated \"Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\" section above. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 primarily resulted from the impact of interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than \n\nthe corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013 described above. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2014 were $14.51 billion, $1.18 billion or 9% higher than in 2013. Earned premiums in 2013 were $13.33 billion, $553 million or 4% higher than in 2012. The increases in both 2014 and 2013 reflected the impact of an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. The increase in net written premiums in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of Dominion. The increase in net written premiums in 2013 also included, to a lesser extent, the impact of the acquisition of Dominion, which occurred on November 1, 2013. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income in 2014 was $2.16 billion, $69 million or 3% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. Net investment income in 2013 was $2.09 billion, $118 million or 5% lower than in 2012. Included in the Business and International Insurance segment are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of the \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nFee Income \n\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2014 increased by $43 million or 11% over 2013. Fee income in 2013 increased by $72 million or 22% over 2012. The increases in both years primarily reflected higher serviced premium volume in workers' compensation residual market pools and higher claim volume in the large deductible business. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nOther revenues in 2013 included a $91 million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $9.15 billion, $860 million or 10% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting (i) the impact of the acquisition of Dominion, (ii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv) a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses, (v) a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and (vi) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (vii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of Dominion). Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $8.29 billion, $98 million or 1% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i) a decline in catastrophe losses and (ii) the impact of a modest decline in volumes of insured exposures (excluding Dominion), partially offset by (iii) the impact of loss cost trends, (iv) a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $2.32 billion, $163 million or 8% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $2.16 billion, $58 million or 3% higher than in 2012. The increase in 2013 was generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2014 were $2.54 billion, $172 million or 7% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion and increases in employee and technology related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums. General and administrative expenses in 2013 were $2.37 billion, $65 million or 3% higher than in 2012, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of Dominion and higher employee and technology related costs. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2014 was $798 million, $40 million or 5% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a $43 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, partially offset by the tax effect of the $17 million decrease in pre-tax operating income in 2014. Income tax expense in 2013 was $758 million, $178 million or 31% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the tax effect of the $601 million increase in pre-tax operating income and the reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above. \n\nCombined Ratio \n\nThe combined ratio of 93.1% in 2014 was 0.3 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.8% in 2013. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.6% in 2014 was 0.8 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.8% in 2013. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 accounted for 2.5 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in each year. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 2.2 points and 3.0 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2014 was level with the 2013 ratio on the same basis, as the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends was offset by higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% in 2014 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.0% in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in earned premiums and a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above. \n\nThe combined ratio of 92.8% in 2013 was 4.3 points lower than the combined ratio of 97.1% in 2012. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.8% in 2013 was 3.5 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.3% in 2012. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 accounted for 2.5 points and 6.5 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 3.0 points and 4.6 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.1 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact of a change in business mix due to an increase in longer-tail loss-sensitive business in National Accounts. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 32.0% in 2013 was 0.8 points lower than the 2012 underwriting expense ratio of 32.8%. The decrease in 2013 primarily reflected the impact of growth in earned premiums. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nThe Business and International Insurance segment's gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Domestic: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Select Accounts &#160; $ 2,754 &#160; $ 2,774 &#160; $ 2,827 &#160; Middle Market &#160; &#160; 6,489 &#160; &#160; 6,250 &#160; &#160; 6,045 &#160; National Accounts &#160; &#160; 1,690 &#160; &#160; 1,606 &#160; &#160; 1,387 &#160; First Party &#160; &#160; 1,846 &#160; &#160; 1,855 &#160; &#160; 1,743 &#160; Specialized Distribution &#160; &#160; 1,081 &#160; &#160; 1,092 &#160; &#160; 1,109 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total Domestic &#160; &#160; 13,860 &#160; &#160; 13,577 &#160; &#160; 13,111 &#160; International &#160; &#160; 2,342 &#160; &#160; 1,415 &#160; &#160; 1,216 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total Business and International Insurance &#160; $ 16,202 &#160; $ 14,992 &#160; $ 14,327 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Domestic: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Select Accounts &#160; $ 2,707 &#160; $ 2,724 &#160; $ 2,775 &#160; Middle Market &#160; &#160; 6,108 &#160; &#160; 5,862 &#160; &#160; 5,654 &#160; National Accounts &#160; &#160; 1,047 &#160; &#160; 1,010 &#160; &#160; 907 &#160; First Party &#160; &#160; 1,579 &#160; &#160; 1,552 &#160; &#160; 1,436 &#160; Specialized Distribution &#160; &#160; 1,074 &#160; &#160; 1,085 &#160; &#160; 1,100 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total Domestic &#160; &#160; 12,515 &#160; &#160; 12,233 &#160; &#160; 11,872 &#160; International &#160; &#160; 2,121 &#160; &#160; 1,279 &#160; &#160; 1,057 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total Business and International Insurance &#160; $ 14,636 &#160; $ 13,512 &#160; $ 12,929 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2014 both increased by 8% over the same period of 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Dominion.

New business premiums in 2013 increased over 2012. \n\nBond &#38; Specialty Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 2,076 &#160; $ 1,981 &#160; $ 1,957 &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 252 &#160; &#160; 260 &#160; &#160; 280 &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total revenues &#160; $ 2,347 &#160; $ 2,261 &#160; $ 2,262 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 1,272 &#160; $ 1,461 &#160; $ 1,544 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Operating income &#160; $ 727 &#160; $ 573 &#160; $ 504 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 22.8 % &#160; 34.7 % &#160; 39.8 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 38.0 &#160; &#160; 38.7 &#160; &#160; 38.6 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Combined ratio &#160; &#160; 60.8 % &#160; 73.4 % &#160; 78.4 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nOperating income in 2014 was $727 million, $154 million or 27% higher than operating income of $573 million in 2013, primarily reflecting the pretax impacts of (i) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iii) lower net investment income. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $450 million and $232 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $6 million and $8 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the pretax impact of lower reinsurance costs. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013, as well as the impact of a $15 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters. \n\nOperating income in 2013 was $573 million, $69 million or 14% higher than operating income of $504 million in 2012. The increase in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins and (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii) lower net investment income. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $232 million and $180 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $8 million and $15 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins was driven by (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by (ii) higher general and administrative expenses and (iii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. The lower effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 was primarily due to the resolution of prior year tax matters described above. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2014 were $2.08 billion, $95 million or 5% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of lower reinsurance costs. Earned premiums in 2013 were $1.98 billion, $24 million or 1% higher than in 2012. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income in 2014 was $252 million, $8 million or 3% lower than in 2013. Net investment income in 2013 was $260 million, $20 million or 7% lower than in 2012. Included in the Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance segment are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a result, reported net investment income in the Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance segment reflects a significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including that from the Company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced an increase in investment income in 2014 and a decrease in investment income in 2013. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of the \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $481 million, $214 million or 31% lower than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $695 million, $93 million or 12% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) reduced loss cost trends and (iii) the impact of lower volumes of construction surety insured exposures. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $388 million, $10 million or 3% higher than in 2013. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $378 million, $5 million or 1% higher than in 2012. The increases in both years primarily reflected the increase in earned premiums. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2014 were $403 million, $15 million or 4% higher than in 2013. General and administrative expenses in 2013 were $388 million, $5 million or 1% higher than in 2012. The increases in both years primarily reflected the impact of higher employee and technology related expenses. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2014 was $348 million, $121 million or 53% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the tax effect of the $275 million increase in pre-tax operating income, as well as the impact of a $15 million reduction in income tax expenses in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. Income tax expense in 2013 was $227 million, $13 million or 6% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the tax effect of the $82 million increase in pre-tax operating income, partially offset by the impact of the $15 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. \n\nCombined Ratio \n\nThe combined ratio of 60.8% in 2014 was 12.6 points lower than the combined ratio of 73.4% in 2013. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 22.8% in 2014 was 11.9 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 34.7% in 2013. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 21.7 points and 11.7 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 accounted for 0.3 points and 0.4 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2014 was 1.8 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of lower reinsurance costs. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 38.0% in 2014 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 38.7% in 2013. The improvement in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of increases in earned premiums largely due to lower reinsurance costs. \n\nThe combined ratio of 73.4% in 2013 was 5.0 points lower than the combined ratio of 78.4% in 2012. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 34.7% in 2013 was 5.1 points lower than the 2012 ratio of 39.8%. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 11.7 points and 9.2 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2013 and 2012. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 accounted for 0.4 points and 0.7 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. The 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 2.3 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 38.7% in 2013 was 0.1 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 38.6% in 2012. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nBond &#38; Specialty Insurance gross and net written premiums were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Total Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance &#160; $ 2,165 &#160; $ 2,131 &#160; $ 2,059 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Total Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance &#160; $ 2,103 &#160; $ 2,030 &#160; $ 1,924 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2014 increased by 2% and 4%, respectively, over 2013. Gross and net written premiums in 2013 increased by 3% and 6%, respectively, over 2012. \n\nNet written premiums in 2014 were $2.10 billion, $73 million or 4% higher than in 2013, primarily driven by lower reinsurance costs that resulted from the Company's decision to eliminate a management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty and higher contract surety premium volume. Excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2014 remained strong and were slightly higher than in 2013. Renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive, although lower than in 2013, driven by renewal rate changes. New business premiums in 2014 decreased from 2013. \n\nNet written premiums in 2013 were $2.03 billion, $106 million or 6% higher than in 2012, primarily driven by higher contract surety volume, rate increases in the management liability business and lower reinsurance costs primarily resulting from a change in a reinsurance treaty. Excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2013 remained strong but were lower than in 2012. Renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive and were higher than in 2012, as increases in renewal rate changes were largely offset by a decline in insured exposures. Renewal rate changes exceeded expected loss cost trends in 2013. New business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012. \n\nPersonal Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Personal Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 7,125 &#160; $ 7,324 &#160; $ 7,621 &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 379 &#160; &#160; 369 &#160; &#160; 404 &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; 103 &#160; &#160; 66 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total revenues &#160; $ 7,584 &#160; $ 7,796 &#160; $ 8,091 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 6,394 &#160; $ 6,592 &#160; $ 7,842 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Operating income &#160; $ 824 &#160; $ 838 &#160; $ 217 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 59.6 % &#160; 59.1 % &#160; 72.3 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 29.1 &#160; &#160; 29.8 &#160; &#160; 29.6 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Combined ratio &#160; &#160; 88.7 % &#160; 88.9 % &#160; 101.9 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative on combined ratio &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.7 % &#160; 1.8 % &#160; 2.3 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nOperating income in 2014 was $824 million, $14 million or 2% lower than operating income of $838 million in 2013. The decrease in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i) an increase in catastrophe losses, (ii) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) a decline in other revenues, partially offset by (iv) higher underlying underwriting margins and (v) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were $336 million and $250 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $169 million and $209 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii) the benefit of the Company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii) the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business. Income tax expense in 2014 was level with 2013. The higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 primarily resulted from the impact of a $5 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters. \n\nOperating income in 2013 was $838 million, $621 million higher than operating income of $217 million in 2012. The increase in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii) an increase in other revenues and (iv) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (v) lower net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $250 million and $1.02 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $209 million and $175 million, respectively. The improvement in underlying underwriting margins resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 primarily resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2014 were $7.13 billion, $199 million or 3% lower than in 2013. Earned premiums in 2013 were $7.32 billion, $297 million or 4% lower than in 2012. The declines in both years reflected reductions in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income in 2014 was $379 million, $10 million or 3% higher than in 2013. Net investment income in 2013 was $369 million, $35 million or 9% lower than in 2012. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the changes in the Company's net investment income in 2014 and 2013 as compared with the respective prior year. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nOther revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges. Other revenues in 2013 also included a $20 million gain from the sale of renewal rights related to the Company's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) business. The Company was a participant in the NFIP Write Your Own Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance &#38; Mitigation Administration. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $4.24 billion, $83 million or 2% lower than in 2013. The decrease primarily reflected (i) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures and (ii) the benefit of the Company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives on claim adjustment expenses, partially offset by (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) the impact of loss cost trends and (v) lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $4.33 billion, $1.18 billion or 21% lower than in 2012. The decrease primarily reflected (i) lower catastrophe losses, (ii) the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures, (iii) lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (v) the impact of loss cost trends. Factors \n\ncontributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $1.17 billion, $112 million or 9% lower than in 2013. The decrease in 2014 primarily reflected a decline in commission expense due to lower commission rates, as well as a decline in earned premiums compared with 2013. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $1.29 billion, $152 million or 11% lower than in 2012. The decrease in 2013 reflected (i) the decline in earned premiums compared with 2012, (ii) a reclassification of fee income related to the National Flood Insurance Program from general and administrative expenses to a component of acquisition costs to conform to the presentation prescribed by insurance regulators, and (iii) lower fixed-value commission expense due to an increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2014 were $977 million, $3 million or less than 1% lower than in 2013. The decrease in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the Company's expense reduction initiatives, largely offset by higher contingent commission expenses and higher underwriting expenses resulting from higher new business levels. General and administrative expenses in 2013 were $980 million, $80 million or 9% higher than in 2012. The increase in 2013 included an increase in contingent commission expense due to an increase in the number of agents reverting from a fixed-value commission compensation program to a contingent commission compensation program and the impact of the reclassification of fee income described above. The increase in 2013 also included the impact of $12 million of restructuring charges, primarily comprised of severance costs related to the Company's announced plan to reduce certain claim and other insurance expenses in this segment. These factors were partially offset by a decline in advertising expense. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense in 2014 was $366 million, level with 2013, as the tax effect of the $14 million decrease in pre-tax operating income was offset by the impact of a $5 million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. Income tax expense in 2013 was $366 million, $334 million higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the impacts of the $955 million increase in pre-tax operating income, partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013. \n\nCombined Ratio \n\nThe combined ratio of 88.7% in 2014 was 0.2 points lower than the combined ratio of 88.9% in 2013. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.6% in 2014 was 0.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% in 2013. Catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 accounted for 4.7 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 2.4 points and 2.8 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The 2014 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.2 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting (i) earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii) the benefit of the Company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii) the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 29.1% in 2014 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.8% in 2013. The decrease in 2014 primarily reflected (i) lower homeowners' commission rates and (ii) the benefit of the Company's expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii) higher underwriting expenses resulting from higher new business levels and (iv) a decrease in earned premiums. \n\nThe combined ratio of 88.9% in 2013 was 13.0 points lower than the combined ratio of 101.9% in 2012. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% in 2013 was 13.2 points lower than the 2012 ratio of 72.3%. Catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 accounted for 3.4 and 13.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 2.8 points and 2.3 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. The 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 2.7 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 29.8% in 2013 was 0.2 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2012. The increase in 2013 primarily reflected the decrease in earned premiums and the expense factors discussed above. \n\nAgency Written Premiums \n\nGross and net written premiums by product line were as follows for the Personal Insurance segment's Agency business, which comprises business written through agents, brokers and other intermediaries and represents almost all of the segment's gross and net written premiums: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Agency Automobile &#160; $ 3,278 &#160; $ 3,277 &#160; $ 3,544 &#160; Agency Homeowners and Other &#160; &#160; 3,800 &#160; &#160; 4,094 &#160; &#160; 4,220 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total Agency Personal Insurance &#160; $ 7,078 &#160; $ 7,371 &#160; $ 7,764 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Agency Automobile &#160; $ 3,260 &#160; $ 3,258 &#160; $ 3,527 &#160; Agency Homeowners and Other &#160; &#160; 3,718 &#160; &#160; 3,805 &#160; &#160; 3,909 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total Agency Personal Insurance &#160; $ 6,978 &#160; $ 7,063 &#160; $ 7,436 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2014, gross and net Agency written premiums were 4% and 1% lower, respectively, than in 2013. The higher rate of decrease in gross written premiums in 2014 was primarily driven by the impact of the sale of the Company's NFIP business in 2013 described above. In 2013, gross and net Agency written premiums were both 5% lower than in 2012. Renewal rate changes exceeded expected loss cost trends in 2013 assuming weather patterns consistent with the Company's expectations. \n\nIn 2014, net written premiums in the Agency Automobile line of business were slightly higher than in 2013. Business retention rates remained strong in 2014 and were higher than in 2013. Renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive but were lower than in 2013, primarily due to lower renewal rate changes. New business premiums in 2014 were significantly higher than in 2013 as a result of the Company's new private passenger automobile product, Quantum Auto 2.0. In 2013 in the Agency Automobile line of business, net written premiums were 8% lower than in 2012. Business retention rates in 2013 remained strong but were lower than in 2012, while new business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012. Renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive and were higher than in 2012, primarily driven by renewal rate changes. \n\nIn 2014, net written premiums in the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business were 2% lower than 2013 as a result of ongoing underwriting actions taken in response to the severe weather events that have occurred over the last several years, including seeking improved rates where the Company believes it is appropriate, as well as improved terms and conditions. Business retention rates remained strong in 2014 and were higher than in 2013. Renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive but were lower than in 2013, primarily due to lower renewal rate changes. New business premiums in 2014 were higher than in 2013. In 2013 in the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business, net written premiums were 3% lower than in 2012 as a result of the ongoing underwriting actions described above. Business retention rates remained strong but were lower than in 2012. Renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive but were lower than in 2012. New business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012. \n\nFor its Agency business, the Personal Insurance segment had approximately 6.0 million and 6.2 million active policies at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nDirect to Consumer Written Premiums \n\nIn its direct to consumer business, net written premiums in 2014 were $187 million, $25 million or 15% higher than in 2013. In 2014, automobile net written premiums increased by $18 million or 16% over 2013, and homeowners and other net written premiums increased by $7 million or 14% over 2013. Net written premiums in 2013 were $162 million, $4 million or 3% higher than in 2012. In 2013, homeowners and other net written premiums increased by $7 million, or 16% over 2012, partially offset by a decline of $3 million, or 3%, in automobile net written premiums compared to 2012. The direct to consumer business had 193,000 and 166,000 active policies at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nInterest Expense and Other \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Operating loss &#160; $ (257 ) $ (248 ) $ (261 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe operating loss for Interest Expense and Other in 2014 was $9 million higher than in 2013. The operating loss for Interest Expense and Other in 2013 was $13 million lower than in 2012. After-tax interest expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $240 million, $235 million and $246 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflected slightly higher average levels of debt outstanding. The decrease in interest expense in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected lower average levels of debt outstanding. \n\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the Company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy). Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those \n\npolicyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. \n\nThe Company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and other Company defenses are not successful, the Company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Although the Company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. \n\nMany coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. There also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the Company. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. \n\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) had previously entered into settlement agreements in connection with a number of these direct action claims (Direct Action Settlements). The Company had been involved in litigation concerning whether all of the conditions of the Direct Action Settlements had been satisfied. On July 22, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that all of the conditions of the Direct Action Settlements had been satisfied. On January 15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the Company to pay $579 million to the plaintiffs, and the Company has made that payment. For a full discussion of these settlement agreements and related litigation, see the \"Asbestos Direct Action Litigation\" section of note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements herein. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. \n\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future \n\nclaim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2014, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and \"non-product\" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends: \n\n&#149; continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily involving mesothelioma claims; &#149; while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the continued high level of litigation activity; and &#149; continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity. While the Company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims. \n\nThe Home Office and Field Office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight increase in net asbestos-related payments in 2014 when compared with 2013. The number of policyholders with pending asbestos claims in these categories as of December 31, 2014 was essentially unchanged when compared with December 31, 2013. Payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. \n\nThe Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the Home Office, Field Office and Assumed Reinsurance and Other categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the Company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. \n\nThe completion of these reviews and analyses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in $250 million, $190 million and $175 million increases, respectively, in the Company's net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the Home Office category due to a higher level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims than previously anticipated. In addition, the reserve increases in 2013 and 2012 also reflected higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. Notwithstanding these trends, the Company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims. \n\nNet asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $242 million, $218 million and $236 million, respectively. Approximately 8%, 1% and 6% of total net paid losses in 2014, 2013 \n\nand 2012, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company's liability. \n\nThe Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Number of Policyholders &#160; Total Net Paid &#160; Net Asbestos Reserves &#160; (at and for the year ended December 31, $ in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; Policyholders with settlement agreements &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 613 &#160; $ 108 &#160; Home office and field office &#160; &#160; 1,692 &#160; &#160; 1,690 &#160; &#160; 197 &#160; &#160; 195 &#160; &#160; 1,574 &#160; &#160; 2,047 &#160; Assumed reinsurance and other &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; 170 &#160; &#160; 195 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 1,709 &#160; &#160; 1,705 &#160; $ 242 &#160; $ 218 &#160; $ 2,357 &#160; $ 2,350 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe \"policyholders with settlement agreements\" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts. Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. As discussed above, on July 22, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that all the conditions of the Direct Action Settlements had been satisfied. As a result, during the third quarter of 2014, $502 million of reserves included in the unallocated IBNR component in the \"home office and field office\" category were reclassified to the \"Policyholders with settlement agreements\" category. For a full discussion of these settlement agreements, including the payment of this settlement and related interest in January 2015, see the \"Settlement of Asbestos Direct Action Litigation\" section of note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe \"home office and field office\" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves in the \"home office and field office\" category include amounts for new claims from and adverse development on existing \"home office and field office\" policyholders, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential \"non-product\" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The \"assumed reinsurance and other\" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. \n\nOn January 29, 2009, the Company and PPG Industries, Inc (\"PPG\"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of PPG, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG. The tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (\"Amended Plan\") proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (\"PCC,\" which is 50% owned by PPG) bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the proposed Amended Plan, which was filed on January 30, 2009, PCC, along with enumerated other companies (including PPG as well as the Company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections \n\nafforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims. Under the agreement in principle, the Company has the option to make a series of payments over the next 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the Trust to be created under the Amended Plan, or it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of March 31, 2015, would total approximately $505 million (approximately $476 million after reinsurance). The agreement in principle with PPG is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the Amended Plan, and the Company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied. The Company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the \"home office and field office\" category in the preceding table. \n\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; $ 2,606 &#160; $ 2,689 &#160; $ 2,780 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (256 ) &#160; (311 ) &#160; (341 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; 2,350 &#160; &#160; 2,378 &#160; &#160; 2,439 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; 258 &#160; &#160; 190 &#160; &#160; 171 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (8 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; 250 &#160; &#160; 190 &#160; &#160; 175 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Paid loss and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; 343 &#160; &#160; 273 &#160; &#160; 262 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (101 ) &#160; (55 ) &#160; (26 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; 242 &#160; &#160; 218 &#160; &#160; 236 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Foreign exchange and other: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; 2,520 &#160; &#160; 2,606 &#160; &#160; 2,689 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (163 ) &#160; (256 ) &#160; (311 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; $ 2,357 &#160; $ 2,350 &#160; $ 2,378 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nSee \"&#151;Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\" \n\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several with other responsible parties. \n\nThe Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount. \n\nThe resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a \"buy-back\" of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. Where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs. \n\nIn establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves. \n\nIn its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements. \n\nThe duration of the Company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years. \n\nThe Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980's. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated. As a result of these factors, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $87 million, $65 million and $90 million, respectively. \n\nNet environmental paid loss and loss expenses were $84 million in each of the years 2014, 2013 and 2012. At December 31, 2014, approximately 92% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $318 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 8% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $28 million), consists of case reserves. \n\nThe following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; $ 355 &#160; $ 352 &#160; $ 346 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (11 ) &#160; (5 ) &#160; (5 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; 344 &#160; &#160; 347 &#160; &#160; 341 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; 94 &#160; &#160; 72 &#160; &#160; 99 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; (7 ) &#160; (9 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; 87 &#160; &#160; 65 &#160; &#160; 90 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Paid loss and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; 95 &#160; &#160; 87 &#160; &#160; 93 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (11 ) &#160; (3 ) &#160; (9 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Acquired reserves, foreign exchange and other:(1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; (2 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; &#160; 353 &#160; &#160; 355 &#160; &#160; 352 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; (11 ) &#160; (5 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net &#160; $ 346 &#160; $ 344 &#160; $ 347 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts in 2013 represent acquired reserves of Dominion at November 1, 2013. \n\nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES \n\nAs a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. \n\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods. \n\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO \n\nThe Company's invested assets at December 31, 2014 were $73.26 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a conservative investment philosophy. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \n\nThe carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2014 was $63.47 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was \"Aa2\" at \n\nboth December 31, 2014 and 2013.

The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $7.56 billion and $9.52 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, which were created to satisfy their responsibility for payments of principal and interest.

Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default. \n\nThe Company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. While its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default, the Company does not rely on enhanced credit characteristics provided by such third-party insurance as part of its investing decisions. Of the insured municipal securities in the Company's investment portfolio at December 31, 2014, approximately 100% were rated at \"A3\" or above, and approximately 88% were rated at \"Aa3\" or above, without the benefit of insurance. The Company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the Company's ability and intent to hold the securities. The average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was \"Aa2\" at December 31, 2014. The average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was \"Aa1\" at December 31, 2014, with and without the enhancement provided by third-party insurance. \n\nDebt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments \n\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments at December 31, 2014. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2014, in millions) \n\n&#160; Carrying Value &#160; Average Credit Quality(1) &#160; Foreign Government: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Canada &#160; $ 1,439 &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; United Kingdom &#160; &#160; 826 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; All Others(2)(3) &#160; &#160; 103 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 2,368 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.

&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The table includes $554 million of short-term securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated \"A-1+\" and/or \"P-1,\" are included as \"Aaa\" rated securities. \n\nIn addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $214 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $136 million to these partnerships. The Company also has $5 million of nonredeemable preferred stock (included in equity securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet) issued by companies in the Eurozone. \n\nMortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities \n\nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $2.21 billion and $2.42 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. Included in the totals at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $872 million and $1.07 billion, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans) and Canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. Also included in those totals were residential CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.34 billion and $1.36 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately 46% and 42% of the Company's CMO holdings at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were \n\nguaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC. The average credit rating of the $725 million and $790 million of non-guaranteed CMO holdings at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was \"Ba1\" and \"Ba3,\" respectively. The average credit rating of all of the above securities was \"Aa3\" and \"A1\" at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nThe Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. \n\nAlternative Documentation Mortgages and Sub-Prime Mortgages \n\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio included CMOs backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $252 million and $293 million, respectively (comprising less than 1% of the Company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). The Company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. Alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. The average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the Company was\"Ba2\" at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size. \n\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans \n\nAt December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $715 million and $475 million, respectively. The average credit rating on these securities held by the Company was \"Aaa\" at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities. \n\nEquity Securities Available for Sale, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes. \n\nOther Investments \n\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than the Company's fixed maturity investments but are subject to more volatility. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.59 billion and $3.44 billion, respectively. \n\nSecurities Lending \n\nThe Company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $296 million and $131 million of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2014 and 2013 was $228 million and $168 million, respectively. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. The Company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. \n\nLloyd's Trust Deposit \n\nThe Company utilizes a Lloyd's trust deposit, whereby owned securities with a fair value of approximately $151 million and $181 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were pledged into a Lloyd's trust account to provide a portion of the capital needed to support the Company's obligations at Lloyd's. \n\nNet Unrealized Investment Gains \n\nThe net unrealized investment gains that were included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; $ 2,673 &#160; $ 1,760 &#160; $ 4,564 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 320 &#160; &#160; 257 &#160; &#160; 183 &#160; Other investments &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Unrealized investment gains before tax &#160; &#160; 3,008 &#160; &#160; 2,030 &#160; &#160; 4,761 &#160; Tax expense &#160; &#160; 1,042 &#160; &#160; 708 &#160; &#160; 1,658 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net unrealized investment gains at end of year &#160; $ 1,966 &#160; $ 1,322 &#160; $ 3,103 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet unrealized investment gains at December 31, 2014 increased over the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in market interest rates during 2014. Net unrealized investment gains at December 31, 2013 declined from the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in market interest rates during 2013. \n\nThe following table summarizes, for all fixed maturities and equity securities reported at fair value for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost at December 31, 2014, the gross unrealized investment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position of greater than 20% of amortized cost: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Period For Which Fair Value Is Less Than 80% of Amortized Cost &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; 3 Months or Less &#160; Greater Than 3 Months, 6 Months or Less &#160; Greater Than 6 Months, 12 Months or Less &#160; Greater Than 12 Months &#160; Total &#160; Fixed maturities : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total fixed maturities &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 8 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThese unrealized investment losses at December 31, 2014 represent less than 1% of the combined fixed maturity and equity security portfolios on a pretax basis and less than 1% of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis. \n\nFor fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity. \n\nAt both December 31, 2014 and 2013, below investment grade securities comprised 3.0% of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2014 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $645 million and a fair value of $619 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized investment loss of $26 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented approximately 1% of both the total amortized cost and the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2014 and accounted for 22.0% of the total gross pretax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2014. \n\nImpairment Charges \n\nImpairment charges included in net realized investment gains in the consolidated statement of income were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; 2012 &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Debt securities issued by foreign governments &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; All other corporate bonds &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; Redeemable preferred stock &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total fixed maturities &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Equity securities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Public common stock &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; Non-redeemable preferred stock &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total equity securities &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Other investments &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 15 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nFollowing are the pretax realized losses on investments sold during the year ended December 31, 2014: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, 2014, in millions) \n\n&#160; Loss &#160; Fair Value &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 523 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 115 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 638 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to \n\nachieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations. \n\nCATASTROPHE MODELING \n\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. The Company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable. \n\nThe Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors to account for non-modeled losses to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are continually updated as new information emerges. \n\nThe tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the current version of the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2014. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.3 billion, or 6% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2014. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Dollars (in billions) &#160; Likelihood of Exceedance(1) \n\n&#160; Single U.S. Hurricane &#160; Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake &#160; 2.0% (1-in-50) &#160; $ 1.0 &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; 1.0% (1-in-100) &#160; $ 1.3 &#160; $ 0.6 &#160; 0.4% (1-in-250) &#160; $ 1.9 &#160; $ 0.9 &#160; 0.1% (1-in-1,000) &#160; $ 3.6 &#160; $ 1.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Percentage of Common Equity(2) &#160; Likelihood of Exceedance \n\n&#160; Single U.S. Hurricane &#160; Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake &#160; 2.0% (1-in-50) &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; 2 % 1.0% (1-in-100) &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; 2 % 0.4% (1-in-250) &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; 4 % 0.1% (1-in-1,000) &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; 7 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a \"1-in-50 year event.\" As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. \n\n(2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions. \n\nThe threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2014 and catastrophic reinsurance program at January 1, 2015, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company's reinsurance, see \"Item 1&#151;Reinsurance.\" The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts. \n\nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. \n\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber-risk. \n\nFor more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\" and \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.\" \n\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS \n\nSevere weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. For example, over the last decade hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced by the Company, thus expanding the Company's potential for losses from hurricanes. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile in recent years, while any further \n\nreductions in arctic sea ice may contribute to rising sea levels that could impact flooding in coastal areas. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. Additionally, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability, frequency and severity of severe weather events or a delay in the recognition of recent changes in climate conditions. \n\nThe Company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this report and under \"&#151;Outlook\" herein. For example, among other things: \n\n&#149; Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\" and \"&#151;Outlook&#151;Underwriting Gain/Loss.\" &#149; Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the Southeastern United States, among other areas. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.\" &#149; Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers. For example, state insurance regulation could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. If the Company is unable to implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\" &#149; The full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. Through the Company's Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. See \"Risk Factors&#151;The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\" Climate change regulation also could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses. \n\nThe Company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. \n\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES \n\nThe Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For additional discussion regarding the Company's reinsurance coverage, see \"Part I&#151;Item 1&#151;Reinsurance.\" \n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses &#160; $ 4,270 &#160; $ 4,707 &#160; Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance &#160; &#160; (203 ) &#160; (239 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Net reinsurance recoverables &#160; &#160; 4,067 &#160; &#160; 4,468 &#160; Mandatory pools and associations &#160; &#160; 1,909 &#160; &#160; 1,897 &#160; Structured settlements &#160; &#160; 3,284 &#160; &#160; 3,348 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 9,260 &#160; $ 9,713 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $401 million decline in net reinsurance recoverables from December 31, 2013 primarily reflected the impact of (i) net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) cash collections, (iii) commutation agreements, as well as (iv) a slightly lower level of reinsurance purchased in 2014. \n\nThe following table presents the Company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2014 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of each reinsurer group at February 12, 2015: \n\n##TABLE_START Reinsurer Group \n\n&#160; Reinsurance Recoverable &#160; A.M.

Best has placed XL Capital Group's ratings under review with negative implications. \n\nOn January 25, 2015, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited and PartnerRe Ltd. announced that they had signed a definitive amalgamation agreement. The Company's aggregated reinsurance recoverables from these entities at December 31, 2014 totaled approximately $236 million. The A.M. Best ratings for each entity at February 12, 2015 was \"A+\" (second highest of 16 ratings). A.M. Best has placed the ratings of each entity under review with negative implications. \n\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company held $1.17 billion of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables. \n\nFor a discussion of a pending reinsurance dispute pertaining to a portion of the Company's reinsurance recoverable from the Munich Re Group in the foregoing table, see note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nIncluded in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim \n\nadjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company's top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2014 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant insurer from each insurer group at February 12, 2015: \n\n##TABLE_START Group \n\n&#160; Structured Settlements &#160; A.M.

Best has placed the ratings of Genworth Financial Group under review with negative implications. \n\nThe Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts. \n\nOUTLOOK \n\nThe following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position. \n\nPremiums. The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of the Business and International Insurance segment, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Net written premiums are also impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs. \n\nOverall, the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong. In the Business and International Insurance segment, the Company expects that renewal premium changes during 2015 will remain positive, driven by both positive renewal rate changes and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures, but will be lower than the levels attained in 2014. In the Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance segment, the Company expects that renewal premium changes during 2015 will be broadly consistent with 2014. With respect to surety, the Company expects net written premium volume in 2015 that is broadly consistent with the levels attained in 2014. In the Personal Insurance segment, the Company expects both Agency Automobile and Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes during 2015 will remain positive, driven by both positive renewal rate changes (based on the Company's actions to file for rate increases) and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures, but will be lower than the levels attained in 2014. The \n\nneed for state regulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. \n\nProperty and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2015 for new business, not only in Business and International Insurance and Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance, but especially in Personal Insurance, where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers, sometimes referred to as \"comparative raters,\" has facilitated the process of generating multiple quotes, thereby increasing price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. The Company anticipates that its new Quantum Auto 2.0 product in the Personal Insurance segment's Agency Automobile line of business, as discussed below, will continue to increase new business premiums during 2015. The Company also anticipates that, as a result of strong business retentions and increases in new business, policies in force in the Personal Insurance segment's Agency Automobile line of business will continue to increase in 2015. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business may negatively impact underwriting profitability. \n\nIn recent years, the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve, has taken extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets, encourage economic growth and keep interest rates low. During this time, the United States has experienced a slow rate of economic growth. Even if economic growth continues in the United States, or other regions in which we do business, it may be at a slow or slower rate for an extended period of time. Further, general uncertainty regarding a variety of domestic and international matters, such as the U.S. Federal budget and taxes, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the regulatory environment and geopolitical instability in various parts of the world, has added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally. If economic conditions deteriorate, the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could adversely impact net written premiums during 2015, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted in 2015. \n\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. \n\nCatastrophe and other weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses in a number of recent periods, which adversely impacted its results of operations. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses were to occur during 2015. \n\nFor the last several years, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development, although at lower levels in some recent periods, driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the Company's segments. The lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development in a number of recent periods may have been in part due to the Company's reserve estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development in previous years. If that trend continues, the better than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels, or even lower levels. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or \n\nother changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year. \n\nIt is possible that the steps taken by the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve, to stabilize financial markets and improve economic conditions could lead to higher inflation than the Company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in the Company's loss costs. The impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered \"long tail\", such as general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. For a further discussion, see \"Part I&#151;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\" \n\nIn Business and International Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins during 2015 that will be modestly higher than in 2014. In making this comparison, the Company has assumed that non-catastrophe weather-related losses and what the Company defines as large losses will be at lower levels than what the Company experienced in 2014, particularly in the second half of that year. \n\nIn Bond &#38; Specialty Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins during 2015 that will be broadly consistent with those in 2014. \n\nIn Personal Insurance, the Company anticipates underlying underwriting margins in 2015 will be lower than in 2014. In Agency Automobile, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2015 that will be slightly lower than in 2014 due to the impact of an expected higher mix of new business versus renewal business. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company anticipates underlying underwriting margins in 2015 that will be lower than in 2014, reflecting normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Also in Personal Insurance, the Company's direct to consumer initiative, the distribution channel that the Company launched in 2009, while intended to enhance the Company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain modest with respect to premium volume and remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures. \n\nThe Agency Automobile line of business has been negatively impacted by various factors, including the use of price comparison technology by agents and brokers as discussed above. The Company's actions in response to these factors have included, among other things, the reduction of certain claim adjustment and other insurance expenses, with the majority of the impact in the Agency Automobile line of business. At December 31, 2014, these actions to reduce costs have resulted in an expected annual decrease of $140 million in pre-tax expenses in 2015 when compared with expense levels prior to their implementation. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company launched its newest private passenger automobile product, Quantum Auto 2.0. This product, in addition to incorporating the cost savings described above, has a lower base commission rate than the Company's existing Quantum Auto 1.0 product. These changes in cost structure enabled the Company to price Quantum Auto 2.0 more competitively while maintaining expected returns at appropriate levels. By December 31, 2014, the Company offered Quantum Auto 2.0 in approximately 90% of the states where it plans to offer the product, and the Company currently expects that, by the end of 2015, it will offer the product in all of those states. The Company intends that, in approved states, all new accounts will be written using Quantum Auto 2.0. In addition, Quantum Auto 2.0 is available to agents at their discretion for existing accounts. \n\nInvestment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.5 (3.7 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2014. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in \n\nU.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $350 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \n\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. \n\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Interest rates remain at very low levels by historical standards. Based on the current interest rate environment, the Company estimates that the impact of lower reinvestment yields on the Company's fixed maturity portfolio could, for 2015, result in approximately $25 million of lower after-tax net investment income from that portfolio on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2014. Given recent general economic and investment market conditions, the Company expects investment income from the non-fixed maturity portfolio during 2015 will be lower than in 2014. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions deteriorate during 2015, the Company could also experience a further reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments. \n\nThe Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.67 billion ($1.75 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2014. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. \n\nFor further discussion of the Company's investment portfolio, see \"Investment Portfolio.\" For a discussion of the risks to the Company's business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to the Company's investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled \"During or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected\" and \"Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses\" included in \"Part I&#151;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of the risks to the Company's investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled \"We are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the United States\" and see \"Part I&#151;Item 7A&#151;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk&#151;Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\" \n\nCapital Position. The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income. In addition, the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. For information regarding the Company's common share repurchases in 2014, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" \n\nMany of the statements in this \"Outlook\" section are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company's control. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. See \"&#151;Forward-Looking Statements.\" For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors\" and \"Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Critical Accounting Estimates.\" \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed. \n\nOperating Company Liquidity. The liquidity requirements of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The insurance subsidiaries' liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the insurance subsidiaries' future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above. Subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Company's principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which in turn pay dividends to the corporate holding (parent) company (TRV). For further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the Company's insurance subsidiaries, see \"Part I&#151;Item 1&#151;Regulation.\" \n\nHolding Company Liquidity. TRV's liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. At December 31, 2014, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating $1.59 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 56 days. These assets are sufficient to meet TRV's current liquidity requirements and are in excess of TRV's minimum target level, which comprises TRV's estimated annual pretax interest expense and common shareholder dividends, and currently totals approximately $1.1 billion. \n\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. U.S. income taxes have not been recognized on $647 million of the Company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2014, as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. Furthermore, taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the U.S. tax on dividend distributions if such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company. The amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2014. \n\nTRV has a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in June 2018. This line of credit also supports TRV's $800 million commercial paper program, of which $100 million was outstanding at December 31, 2014. TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. \n\nThe Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $118 million, to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations at Lloyd's at December 31, 2014. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand. \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.69 billion, $3.82 billion and $3.23 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cash flows in 2014 primarily reflected higher levels of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commission expenses, as well as higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher levels of collected premiums. These increases included the impact of the Company's acquisition of Dominion. Cash flows in 2013 primarily reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes and a higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments. Cash flows in 2012 primarily reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes, a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff and a higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an increase in paid losses related to non-catastrophe ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs). In 2014 and 2012, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $200 million and $217 million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension plan. In 2013, the Company made no contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. The qualified domestic pension plan was 96% and 106% funded at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities in 2014 were $206 million, compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of $910 million and $972 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2013 total included $997 million related to the Company's acquisition of Dominion (net of cash acquired). The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2014 increased by $101 million, or less than 1% over year-end 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of net cash flows provided by operating activities and an increase in net unrealized appreciation of investments, largely offset by common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2013 decreased by $678 million, or 1% over year-end 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of a significant decline in net unrealized appreciation of investments driven by an increase in interest rates, common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by net cash flows provided by operating activities and the acquisition of Dominion. \n\nOn December 5, 2012, the Company increased its ownership in J. Malucelli Participa&#231;&#245;es em Seguros e Resseguros S.A, its Brazilian joint venture (JMalucelli), through the exercise of a pre-existing option. As a result, the Company increased its ownership to 49.5% of the venture. JMalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in Brazil based on market share. The Company's investment was funded with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the Company. \n\nThe Company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary goals of the Company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $3.81 billion, $2.94 billion and $2.15 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The totals in each year primarily reflected common share repurchases and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The total in 2013 also included the issuance of 4.60% senior notes for net proceeds of $494 million and the payment of the Company's $500 million, 5.00% senior notes at maturity. Common share repurchases in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $3.33 billion, $2.46 billion and $1.53 billion, respectively. \n\nDebt Transactions . \n\n2013. On July 25, 2013, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.60% senior notes that will mature on August 1, 2043. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately $494 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on February 1, 2014. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points. \n\nOn March 15, 2013, the Company's $500 million, 5.00% senior notes matured and were fully paid. \n\n2012. On May 29, 2012, the Company purchased and retired $8.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 in an open market transaction. The Company's $250 million, 5.375% senior notes matured on June 15, 2012 and were paid from existing holding company liquidity. \n\nIn 2015, the amount of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that comes due is $400 million. The Company may refinance maturing debt through funds generated internally or, depending on market conditions, through funds generated externally, including as a result of the issuance of debt or other securities. \n\nDividends. Dividends paid to shareholders were $729 million, $729 million and $694 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be at the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. On January 22, 2015, the Company announced that it declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, payable March 31, 2015, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2015. \n\nShare Repurchases. The Company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and \n\nacquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. The following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2014 and remaining repurchase capacity at December 31, 2014. \n\n##TABLE_START Quarterly Period Ending (in millions, except per share amounts) \n\n&#160; Number of shares purchased &#160; Cost of shares repurchased &#160; Average price paid per share &#160; Remaining capacity under share repurchase authorization &#160; March 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; 7.8 &#160; $ 650 &#160; $ 82.97 &#160; $ 4,109 &#160; June 30, 2014 &#160; &#160; 9.5 &#160; &#160; 875 &#160; &#160; 92.67 &#160; &#160; 3,234 &#160; September 30, 2014 &#160; &#160; 8.1 &#160; &#160; 750 &#160; &#160; 92.47 &#160; &#160; 2,484 &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; 9.7 &#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; 102.82 &#160; &#160; 1,484 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 35.1 &#160; $ 3,275 &#160; &#160; 93.27 &#160; &#160; 1,484 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nFrom the inception of the first authorization on May 2, 2006 through December 31, 2014, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 425.9 million shares for a total cost of $24.52 billion, or an average of $57.56 per share. \n\nIn 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company acquired 0.7 million, 0.8 million and 0.9 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options. \n\n2014 Stock Incentive Plan. In February 2014, the Company's board of directors approved The Travelers Companies, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Incentive Plan) to replace, effective with shareholder approval, the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2004 Incentive Plan), which was scheduled to expire in July 2014. At the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 27, 2014, the shareholders approved the 2014 Incentive Plan. Accordingly, the 2014 Incentive Plan became effective on that date, and no further awards will be made under the 2004 Incentive Plan. The 2014 Incentive plan has substantially the same terms, other than the number of shares available, as the 2004 Incentive Plan and is effective through February 5, 2024. The number of shares initially available for issuance under the 2014 Incentive Plan was 10,000,000 shares of common stock. Shares of common stock subject to awards granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan or the prior 2004 Incentive Plan that (i) expire unexercised, (ii) are forfeited, terminated or canceled, (iii) are settled in cash or other forms of property, or (iv) otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares of common stock, will be available for grant under the 2014 Incentive Plan. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nCapital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company's capital structure at December 31, 2014 and 2013. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; Debt: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; $ 500 &#160; $ 100 &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; 5,861 &#160; &#160; 6,261 &#160; Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs &#160; &#160; (12 ) &#160; (15 ) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total debt &#160; &#160; 6,349 &#160; &#160; 6,346 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Shareholders' equity: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock &#160; &#160; 23,956 &#160; &#160; 23,986 &#160; Accumulated other comprehensive income &#160; &#160; 880 &#160; &#160; 810 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total shareholders' equity &#160; &#160; 24,836 &#160; &#160; 24,796 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total capitalization &#160; $ 31,185 &#160; $ 31,142 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal capitalization at December 31, 2014 was $31.19 billion, $43 million higher than at December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of net income of $3.69 billion and an increase in net unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by common share repurchases totaling $3.28 billion under the Company's share repurchase authorization and shareholder dividends of $735 million. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; Total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments &#160; $ 29,219 &#160; $ 29,820 &#160; Net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes &#160; &#160; 1,966 &#160; &#160; 1,322 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total capitalization &#160; $ 31,185 &#160; $ 31,142 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Debt-to-total capital ratio &#160; &#160; 20.4 % &#160; 20.4 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments &#160; &#160; 21.7 % &#160; 21.3 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate movements and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company's financial leverage position. The Company's ratio of debt-to-total capital (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) of 21.7% at December 31, 2014 was within the Company's target range of 15% to 25%. \n\nCredit Agreement. The Company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in June 2018. Terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nShelf Registration. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering. \n\nShare Repurchase Authorization. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $1.48 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2014, the Company's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim-related payments. The table excludes short-term liabilities and includes only obligations at December 31, 2014 that are expected to be settled in cash. \n\nThe table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may \n\nbe significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments has unavoidable estimation uncertainty. \n\nThe contractual obligations at December 31, 2014 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period (in millions) \n\n&#160;

The table above includes interest payments through the scheduled maturity date of March 15, 2037. Interest payments beginning March 15, 2017 through March 15, 2037 were calculated using the three-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2014. See note 8 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding indebtedness. Because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest, the total long-term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note 8. \n\n(2) Represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space, equipment and furniture. \n\n(3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services. (4) Includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and services including property, plant and equipment, office supplies, archival services, etc. (5) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships. (6) The amounts in \"Claims and claim adjustment expenses\" in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies. The Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note 5 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. The assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities. \n\nThe estimated future cash inflows from the Company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1 - 3 Years &#160; 3 - 5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; &#160; Reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 5,627 &#160; $ 748 &#160; $ 1,013 &#160; $ 631 &#160; $ 3,235 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses on a net of reinsurance basis. The estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1 - 3 Years &#160; 3 - 5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expenses, net &#160; $ 42,019 &#160; $ 9,163 &#160; $ 9,719 &#160; $ 5,100 &#160; $ 18,037 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2014. \n\nThe amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. (See note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements.) \n\n(7) Workers' compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. \"Claims from large deductible policies\" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as \"contractholder payables\" and \"contractholder receivables,\" respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within \"Claims and claim adjustment expenses\" in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table. The estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers' compensation policies is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1 - 3 Years &#160; 3 - 5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; &#160; Contractholder payables/receivables &#160; $ 4,362 &#160; $ 1,089 &#160; $ 1,211 &#160; $ 657 &#160; $ 1,405 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(8) The amounts in \"Loss-based assessments\" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. For loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in \"other liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet. (9) The amounts in \"Payout from ceded funds withheld\" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the Company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held. (10) The Company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $628 million. Offsetting these liabilities are deferred tax assets of $588 million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized. The above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company is not currently subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table. \n\nDividend Availability \n\nThe Company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of Connecticut. The insurance holding company laws of Connecticut applicable to the Company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company's subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat \n\nmore restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $3.25 billion is available by the end of 2015 for such dividends to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2015 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2015, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department. \n\nIn addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 8 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign operations are not material and are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. \n\nTRV and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received $4.10 billion of dividends in 2014 from their U.S. insurance subsidiaries. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all U.S. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees. \n\nThe Qualified Plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan for 2015 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2016. The Company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, there was no minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan. In 2014 and 2012, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $200 million and $217 million, respectively, to the Qualified Plan. In determining future contributions, the Company will consider the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the Company's other capital requirements. The Company has not determined whether or not additional voluntary funding will be made in the 2015. However, the Company currently believes, subject to actual plan performance and funded status at the time, that it may make voluntary pension contributions of approximately $75 million to $100 million annually beginning in 2015 as well as over the following several years. \n\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company updated its mortality assumptions for estimating its qualified pension plan liabilities utilizing a new mortality table and related improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014. The adoption of the new mortality table and related improvement scale increased the projected benefit obligation by $150 million at December 31, 2014. \n\nThe Qualified Plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. The Company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. For 2015, the Company plans to apply an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%, down from 7.50% in 2014. The expected rate of return reflects the Company's current expectations with regard to long-term returns on the Qualified Plan's invested assets, taking into account the current valuation of U.S. equities, the 75% increase in the S&#38;P 500 Index over the past three years and the current low level of long-term interest rates which, according to the Federal Reserve's Commentary in December 2014, are expected to remain at their current low level until its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation are achieved. The Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future. \n\nFor further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nRisk-Based Capital \n\nThe NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Each of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at December 31, 2014 significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would occur. Regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force. Each of the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2014. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nThe Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. See note 16 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments. \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves \n\nGross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; December 31, 2013 &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Case &#160; IBNR &#160; Total &#160; Case &#160; IBNR &#160; Total &#160; General liability &#160; $ 5,886 &#160; $ 7,826 &#160; $ 13,712 &#160; $ 5,355 &#160; $ 8,604 &#160; $ 13,959 &#160; Commercial property &#160; &#160; 795 &#160; &#160; 496 &#160; &#160; 1,291 &#160; &#160; 778 &#160; &#160; 542 &#160; &#160; 1,320 &#160; Commercial multi-peril &#160; &#160; 1,849 &#160; &#160; 1,819 &#160; &#160; 3,668 &#160; &#160; 1,879 &#160; &#160; 1,707 &#160; &#160; 3,586 &#160; Commercial automobile &#160; &#160; 2,094 &#160; &#160; 1,249 &#160; &#160; 3,343 &#160; &#160; 2,305 &#160; &#160; 1,219 &#160; &#160; 3,524 &#160; Workers' compensation &#160; &#160; 10,067 &#160; &#160; 8,191 &#160; &#160; 18,258 &#160; &#160; 9,918 &#160; &#160; 7,856 &#160; &#160; 17,774 &#160; Fidelity and surety &#160; &#160; 233 &#160; &#160; 573 &#160; &#160; 806 &#160; &#160; 426 &#160; &#160; 818 &#160; &#160; 1,244 &#160; Personal automobile &#160; &#160; 1,737 &#160; &#160; 848 &#160; &#160; 2,585 &#160; &#160; 1,793 &#160; &#160; 785 &#160; &#160; 2,578 &#160; Homeowners and personal&#151;other &#160; &#160; 578 &#160; &#160; 525 &#160; &#160; 1,103 &#160; &#160; 635 &#160; &#160; 551 &#160; &#160; 1,186 &#160; International and other &#160; &#160; 3,254 &#160; &#160; 1,804 &#160; &#160; 5,058 &#160; &#160; 3,585 &#160; &#160; 2,109 &#160; &#160; 5,694 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Property-casualty &#160; &#160; 26,493 &#160; &#160; 23,331 &#160; &#160; 49,824 &#160; &#160; 26,674 &#160; &#160; 24,191 &#160; &#160; 50,865 &#160; Accident and health &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; 30 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 30 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves &#160; $ 26,519 &#160; $ 23,331 &#160; $ 49,850 &#160; $ 26,704 &#160; $ 24,191 &#160; $ 50,895 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $1.05 billion decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2013 primarily reflected the impact of favorable prior year reserve development, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and payments related to operations in runoff. \n\nAsbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\", \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" and \"Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\" \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR). Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and subrogation. Estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in \"Reinsurance Recoverables\" as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. \n\nThe process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the \n\nprocess, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. The Company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded&#151;favorable or unfavorable. \n\nBecause establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. \n\nThere are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge. \n\nA portion of the Company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $2.87 billion at December 31, 2014) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company's future operating results. See the preceding discussion of \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation.\" \n\nGeneral Discussion \n\nThe process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. \n\nMultiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and \n\nweaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. \n\nIn most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate. \n\nThe exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. \n\nProperty-casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. \n\nMost general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others. \n\nA basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. \n\nInformed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult. \n\nThe variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. \n\nProduct lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. \n\nA major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. \n\nFor some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being \"low frequency/high severity,\" while lines without this \"large claim\" sensitivity are referred to as \"high frequency/low severity.\" Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable. \n\nClaim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. \n\nActuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. \n\nLastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization. \n\nRisk factors \n\nThe major causes of material uncertainty (\"risk factors\") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently. \n\nSome risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. \n\nThe effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. \n\nThe evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. \n\nWhile some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. \n\nSudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. \n\nActuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves \n\nThe principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company's actuaries to evaluate management's existing estimates for prior accident periods are the paid development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method. The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. These are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (See Glossary for an explanation of these methods). \n\nWhile these are the principal methods utilized throughout the Company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The Company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates. \n\nSome components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. In such cases, the Company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as: \n\n&#149; Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available. &#149; Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.) &#149; Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis. &#149; Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental). 139 \n\nThe results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management's best estimate. Additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods. \n\nThe methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. Hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate. \n\nManagement's estimates \n\nAt least once per quarter, certain members of Company management meet with the Company's actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. \n\nSuch an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform. This is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company's estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. \n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves. \n\nDiscussion of Product Lines \n\nThe following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. \n\nIn order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year period are \n\nprovided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (SPC) or TPC. This treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available. \n\nGeneral Liability \n\nGeneral liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for \"construction defect\" claims). \n\nWhile the majority of general liability coverages are written on an \"occurrence\" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a \"claims-made\" basis. \n\nGeneral liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. \n\nIn addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods. \n\nDefense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. Such \"defense within the limits\" policies are most common for \"claims-made\" products. When defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no contractual limit. \n\nThis line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the \"event\" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such \n\nclaims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure). \n\nThe amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics. \n\nIn addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and S-curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred development methods. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nGeneral liability risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in claim handling philosophies &#149; Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions &#149; New or expanded theories of liability &#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues &#149; Changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim &#149; Changes in statutes of limitations &#149; Changes in the underlying court system &#149; Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues &#149; Changes in tort law &#149; Shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts &#149; Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) &#149; The potential impact of inflation on loss costs 142 \n\n&#149; Changes in settlement patterns General liability book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from &#150;8% to 2% (averaging &#150;4%) for the Company, and from &#150;5% to 2% (averaging &#150;3%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 23% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was &#150;5% for 2014, &#150;4% for 2013 and &#150;3% for 2012. The 2014 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2008 through 2012, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected. The 2013 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2010 and prior, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected. The 2012 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2009 and prior, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected. Also contributing to the 2012 change was better than expected results for management liability business, primarily for the errors &#38; omissions and fiduciary products for accident years 2007 and prior. \n\nCommercial Property \n\nCommercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. \n\nCommercial property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nCommercial property risk factors \n\n&#149; Physical concentration of policyholders &#149; Availability and cost of local contractors 143 \n\n&#149; For the more severe catastrophic events, \"demand surge\" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services &#149; Local building codes &#149; Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) &#149; Frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed &#149; Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) &#149; Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) &#149; Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations Commercial property book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from &#150;25% to &#150;5% (averaging &#150;16%) for the Company, and from &#150;14% to &#150;5% (averaging &#150;9%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nSince commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2013 and 2014 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina and Storm Sandy. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was &#150;18% for 2014, &#150;17% for 2013 and &#150;22% for 2012. The 2014 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2010 through 2013, including catastrophe losses from Storm Sandy for accident year 2012. The 2013 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2010 through 2012, driven by favorable loss development related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. The 2012 change primarily reflected better than expected development for accident years 2009 through 2011, driven by favorable loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011, and by higher subrogation and salvage recoveries for accident years 2009 through 2011. \n\nCommercial Multi-Peril \n\nCommercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. \n\nThe reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers. \n\nSee \"Commercial property risk factors\" and \"General liability risk factors,\" discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril. \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from &#150;19% to 5% (averaging &#150;4%) for the Company, and from &#150;6% to 0% (averaging &#150;3%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nAs discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2014, 2% for 2013 and &#150;1% for 2012. The 2014 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2010 through 2013. The 2013 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2008 through 2011, driven by higher than expected severity and defense costs. \n\nCommercial Automobile \n\nThe commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nCommercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. \n\nThe Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors \n\n&#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the underlying court system &#149; Changes in case law &#149; Litigation trends &#149; Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits &#149; Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents &#149; Changes in auto safety technology &#149; Subrogation opportunities &#149; Changes in claim handling philosophies &#149; Frequency of visits to health providers &#149; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers &#149; Types of health providers used &#149; Types of medical treatments received &#149; Changes in cost of medical treatments &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Commercial automobile book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) &#149; Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from &#150;10% to 7% (averaging &#150;2%) for the Company, and from &#150;3% to 3% (averaging &#150;1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was &#150;2% for 2014, 1% for 2013 and 7% for 2012. The 2014 change reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years \n\n2011 and 2012. The 2012 change reflected higher than expected severity in the bodily injury coverage primarily for accident years 2010 and 2011. \n\nWorkers' Compensation \n\nWorkers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. \n\nWorkers' compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nIndemnity risk factors \n\n&#149; Time required to recover from the injury &#149; Degree of available transitional jobs &#149; Degree of legal involvement &#149; Changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers' compensation claims &#149; Future wage inflation for states that index benefits &#149; Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds Medical risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (\"inflation\") &#149; Frequency of visits to health providers &#149; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers &#149; Types of health providers used &#149; Type of medical treatments received &#149; Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices &#149; Availability of new medical processes and equipment &#149; Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment 147 \n\nGeneral workers' compensation risk factors \n\n&#149; Frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed &#149; Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment &#149; Degree of cost shifting between workers' compensation and health insurance, including Medicare, and the impact, if any, of the Affordable Care Act Workers' compensation book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Product mix &#149; Injury type mix &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers' compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from &#150;2% to 1% (averaging 0%) for the Company, and from &#150;2 to 2% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Workers' compensation reserves represent approximately 37% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2014, &#150;1% in 2013 and &#150;2% in 2012. The 2012 change was primarily driven by better than expected frequency and severity related to lifetime medical claims for accident years 2008 and prior. \n\nFidelity and Surety \n\nFidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims. \n\nSurety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being insured. (Large construction projects can take many years to complete.) The frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction projects. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other \n\nsecurity positions of an insured's assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nFidelity risk factors \n\n&#149; Type of business of insured &#149; Policy limit and attachment points &#149; Third-party claims &#149; Coverage litigation &#149; Complexity of claims &#149; Growth in insureds' operations Surety risk factors \n\n&#149; Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity &#149; Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims &#149; Type of business insured &#149; Type of obligation insured &#149; Cumulative limits of liability for insured &#149; Assets available to mitigate loss &#149; Defective workmanship/latent defects &#149; Financial strategy of insured &#149; Changes in statutory obligations &#149; Geographic spread of business Fidelity and Surety book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from &#150;36% to &#150;1% (averaging &#150;12%) for the Company, and from &#150;13% to 14% (averaging &#150;5%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 2% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nIn general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was &#150;36% for 2014, &#150;21% for 2013 and &#150;8% for 2012. The 2014 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2012 and prior. The 2013 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2010 and prior. The 2012 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2008 and prior. \n\nPersonal Automobile \n\nPersonal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nPersonal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors \n\n&#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy &#149; Changes in case law &#149; Litigation trends &#149; Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits &#149; Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents &#149; Subrogation opportunities &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment &#149; Changes in claim handling philosophies No-fault risk factors (for selected states and time periods) \n\n&#149; Effectiveness of no-fault laws &#149; Frequency of visits to health providers &#149; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers &#149; Types of health providers used &#149; Types of medical treatments received 150 \n\n&#149; Changes in cost of medical treatments &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Personal automobile book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from &#150;7% to 3% (averaging &#150;1%) for the Company, and from &#150;4% to &#150;1% (averaging &#150;3%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Personal automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 1% for 2014, 1% for 2013 and 2% for 2012. The 2012 change was primarily driven by higher than expected bodily injury severity for accident year 2011. \n\nHomeowners and Personal Lines Other \n\nHomeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. \n\nThe liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. \n\nOverall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. \n\nHomeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nNon-catastrophe risk factors \n\n&#149; Salvage opportunities &#149; Amount of time to return property to residential use &#149; Changes in weather patterns &#149; Local building codes &#149; Litigation trends 151 \n\n&#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) &#149; Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) &#149; Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations Catastrophe risk factors \n\n&#149; Physical concentration of policyholders &#149; Availability and cost of local contractors &#149; Local building codes &#149; Quality of construction of damaged homes &#149; Amount of time to return property to residential use &#149; For the more severe catastrophic events, \"demand surge\" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services Homeowners book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) &#149; Degree of concentration of policyholders &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from &#150;22% to 2% (averaging &#150;11%) for the Company, and from &#150;7% to &#150;2% (averaging &#150;5%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 2% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThis line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was &#150;16% for 2014, &#150;17% for 2013 and &#150;11% for 2012. The 2014 change was primarily \n\ndriven by better than expected loss experience for non-catastrophe weather-related losses for accident year 2013 and for catastrophe losses for accident years 2011 through 2013. The 2013 change was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience for catastrophe losses incurred in 2012 and non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident years 2012 and 2011. The 2012 change reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and non-catastrophe losses incurred in accident years 2010 and 2011. \n\nInternational and Other \n\nInternational and other includes products written by the Company's international operations, as well as all other products not explicitly discussed above. The principal component of \"other\" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff business. \n\nInternational and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. \n\nDue to changes in the business mix for this line over time, including the recent acquisition of Dominion, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively shorter tail (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes. \n\nInternational reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability in Canada, Commercial Property in the United Kingdom, etc.). The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the Homeowners, Personal Automobile, Commercial Automobile, General Liability, Commercial Property and Surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. For example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages. \n\nOther reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability&#151;excess of loss reinsurance). Excess exposure requires the insured to \"prove\" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy's attachment point. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section, and in the Personal Automobile, Homeowners, General Liability, Commercial Property, Commercial Automobile and Surety discussions above) include: \n\nInternational and other risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers &#149; Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision 153 \n\n&#149; Economic trends &#149; New theories of liability &#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the propensity to sue &#149; Changes in statutes of limitations &#149; Changes in the underlying court system &#149; Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues &#149; Changes in tort law &#149; Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) International and other book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, \"claims-made\" language) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 9% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nInternational and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the U.S. do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other. \n\nReinsurance Recoverables \n\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. \n\nThe Company has entered into two reinsurance contracts in connection with catastrophe bonds issued by Long Point Re III. Both of these contracts meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The catastrophe bonds are described in more detail in \"Item 1&#151;Business&#151;Catastrophe Reinsurance.\" \n\nThe Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the Company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges. \n\nRecoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers' compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally. \n\nFor a discussion of a pending reinsurance dispute pertaining to a portion of the Company's reinsurance recoverable from the Munich Re Group, see note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInvestment Valuation and Impairments \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: \n\n&#149; Level 1 &#151; Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. &#149; Level 2 &#151; Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data. &#149; Level 3 &#151; Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use. Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements \n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a \n\nforced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. \n\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally recognized pricing services. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes these pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value. The fair value estimates provided from these pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. If quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as Level 2 or Level 3. The Company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction. \n\nFixed Maturities \n\nThe Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. The pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Additionally, the pricing service uses an Option Adjusted Spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. \n\nThe pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. The market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. For some securities, additional inputs may be necessary. \n\nThe pricing service utilized by the Company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. If the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the Company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions. \n\nThe fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices. \n\nThe Company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the Company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market. In addition, the Company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets. The Company \n\nproduces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%. The Company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value. In addition, the Company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). The Company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio. These processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service. \n\nThe Company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. The underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the U.S. Treasury curve are the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index and the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield BB Rated Index. The Company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in Level 2, since all significant inputs are market observable. \n\nWhile the vast majority of the Company's municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal pricing matrix was $92 million and $94 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company received a broker quote was $140 million and $161 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. \n\nNon-Fixed Maturities and Other Investments Not Reported at Fair Value \n\nSee note 4 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of non-fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements. \n\nInvestment Impairments \n\nThe Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. Some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1) for fixed maturity investments, whether the Company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2) for non-fixed maturity investments, the Company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e., whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices. \n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities \n\nFor fixed maturity investments that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). The impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income. \n\nFor equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses). \n\nUpon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment. \n\nDue to the subjective nature of the Company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of investment impairments. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairments \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nOTHER UNCERTAINTIES \n\nFor a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see note 16 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors.\" \n\nFUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nSee note 1 of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards updates. \n\nThe Company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). During the last several years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been evaluating whether, when and how International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) should be incorporated into the U.S. financial reporting system. In July 2012, the SEC staff issued a final report on its work plan which concluded that IFRS provide high quality accounting standards, but also indicated concerns with funding, consistency of application and enforcement of IFRS globally. In November 2014, the SEC announced that it intends to develop a recommendation in the next couple of months on whether the SEC should move towards using IFRS for public companies. \n\nThe FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) are in the final phases of their long-term convergence program with the intent of developing global standards for several significant areas of accounting, including the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments. In February 2014, the FASB decided to discontinue the full insurance project and instead make targeted changes to U.S. GAAP for insurance contracts. For property and casualty insurance contracts, the FASB decided to limit the targeted improvements to enhanced disclosures and is targeting the first quarter of 2015 to finalize the new disclosure requirements. The IASB is expected to complete its project in 2016 which may require valuation and accounting that is significantly different than under the U.S. GAAP model for short-duration contracts. \n\nIn 2014, the IASB issued a final financial instruments standard with an effective date of January 1, 2018, which provides guidance that is significantly different than current U.S. GAAP, e.g., under the new IFRS standard changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities would be reported in earnings whereas current U.S. GAAP reports such changes in other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders' equity. The FASB is in the final stages of completing an update to its current financial instruments guidance. The FASB has tentatively decided on different models for impairments, and classification and measurement of financial instruments than the IASB. The tentative FASB decisions would result in minor changes in the accounting of financial instruments for the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIt appears likely that the Boards will have different insurance and financial instrument standards that could result in the Company having to apply accounting standards for its consolidated financial statements that are different from the accounting standard used for local reporting in foreign jurisdictions. \n\nThe Company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt IFRS or how the adoption of IFRS may impact the Company's financial statements in the future. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report contains, and management may make, certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"likely,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates\" and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements.
