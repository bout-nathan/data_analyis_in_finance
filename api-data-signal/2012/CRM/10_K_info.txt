MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled &#147;Forward-Looking Information&#148; and &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or &#147;cloud.&#148; We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. \n\nOur mission is to help our customers transform themselves into &#147;customer companies&#148; by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core services&#151;Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platform&#151;customers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Strengthening our market-leading core solutions; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Innovating in high-growth markets; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Improve renewal rates; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuing new customers aggressively; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Building our business in top markets globally; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. \n\n##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers&#146; willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers&#146; willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers&#146; ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers&#146; purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. \n\nTo address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, \n\n&#160; \n\nencourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. \n\nWe also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we anticipate we will have net losses on a GAAP basis for the next several quarters. \n\nIn November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We have capitalized all pre-construction activities related to the development of the land, including interest costs and property taxes since the November 2010 purchase. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity. The total carrying value of the land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights was $321.1 million as of January 31, 2013. We continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and our options for the undeveloped real estate. \n\nWe expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2013 and 52 percent for fiscal 2012, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. \n\nOn August 13, 2012, we acquired the outstanding stock of Buddy Media, Inc., (&#147;Buddy&#148;), a social media marketing platform. We acquired Buddy for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Buddy&#146;s social media marketing platform with our current offerings. The financial results of Buddy are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Buddy was $735.8 million. \n\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence as of October 31, 2013 and recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 in the amount of $149.1 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. This accounting treatment has no effect on our actual ability to utilize deferred tax assets such as loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce future cash tax payments. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. \n\nFiscal Year \n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2013, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2013. \n\n&#160; \n\nSources of Revenues \n\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. &#147;Other revenue&#148; consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2013. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and service renewal rates. We define a &#147;customer&#148; as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a &#147;subscription&#148; as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a &#147;subscriber.&#148; The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011. \n\nSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. \n\nProfessional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. \n\nIn determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#151;Revenue Recognition&#148; below. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. \n\nIn October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, &#147; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements&#151;a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force &#148; (&#147;ASU 2009-13&#148;) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the new guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which was the beginning of our fiscal 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable \n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we introduced greater operational discipline around annual invoicing, for both new business and renewals which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 marks the one year anniversary of this operational shift, therefore the incremental benefit to deferred revenue from annual invoicing was lower than it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. \n\nAccordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) &#160; April 30, 2012 &#160; &#160; July 31, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 31, 2012 &#160; &#160; January 31, 2013 &#160; Fiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; $ 371,395 &#160; &#160; $ 446,917 &#160; &#160; $ 418,590 &#160; &#160; $ 872,634 &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,334,716 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,337,184 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,291,703 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,862,995 &#160; (in thousands) &#160; April 30, 2011 &#160; &#160; July 31, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 31, 2011 &#160; &#160; January 31, 2012 &#160; Fiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; $ 270,816 &#160; &#160; $ 342,397 &#160; &#160; $ 312,331 &#160; &#160; $ 683,745 &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 915,133 &#160; &#160; &#160; 935,266 &#160; &#160; &#160; 917,821 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,380,295 &#160; (in thousands) &#160; April 30, 2010 &#160; &#160; July 31, 2010 &#160; &#160; October 31, 2010 &#160; &#160; January 31, 2011 &#160; Fiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; $ 183,612 &#160; &#160; $ 228,550 &#160; &#160; $ 258,764 &#160; &#160; $ 426,943 &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 664,529 &#160; &#160; &#160; 683,019 &#160; &#160; &#160; 694,557 &#160; &#160; &#160; 934,941 &#160; ##TABLE_END Unbilled Deferred Revenue \n\nThe deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013 and approximately $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012. Due to our sales to large enterprise accounts, we are experiencing longer contractual commitments by our customers which is reflected in our growing unbilled deferred revenue. Also as a result, our average contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. This has a positive impact on our renewal rate. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero \n\n&#160; \n\njust prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. \n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses \n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. \n\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. \n\nResearch and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. \n\nMarketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. \n\nWe plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. \n\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute \n\n&#160; \n\ndollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. \n\nStock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. \n\nFor fiscal 2013, we recognized stock-based expense of $379.4 million. As of January 31, 2013, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $1.2 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $491.0 million during fiscal 2014; $394.2 million during fiscal 2015; $249.8 million during fiscal 2016; and $92.5 million during fiscal 2017. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2013 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. \n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#146;s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRevenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. &#147;Other revenue&#148; consists primarily of training fees. \n\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The service has been or is being provided to the customer; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. \n\n##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription and Support Revenues \n\nSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. \n\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues \n\nThe majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. \n\nMultiple-Deliverable Arrangements \n\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support, and professional services. \n\nPrior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized. \n\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, &#147; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements&#151;a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force &#148; (&#147;ASU 2009-13&#148;) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We have applied the updated accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which was the beginning of fiscal 2012. \n\nThe adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. As of January 31, 2013, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $9.3 million and approximately $3.9 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. \n\nUnder the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the \n\n&#160; \n\nservices from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer&#146;s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. \n\nUnder the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (&#147;VSOE&#148;), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (&#147;BESP&#148;), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (&#147;TPE&#148;) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. \n\nFor certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. \n\nWe determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. \n\nDeferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. \n\nAs a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. \n\nDeferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. \n\nDeferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer&#146;s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal 2013, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $167.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $107.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $254.4 million at January 31, 2013 and $176.6 million at January 31, 2012. \n\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets . We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. \n\nThe value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. \n\nWe evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. \n\nStrategic Investments . We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. \n\nBusiness Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. \n\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the acquired company&#146;s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; discount rates. \n\n##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \n\nStock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;). The fair value of each option or award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights. \n\n##TABLE_END Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. \n\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. \n\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Examples of positive and negative evidence include historical taxable income or losses, forecasted income or losses, the estimated timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. Our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. \n\nOur tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and accounting principles as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders&#146; equity. \n\n&#160; \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Revenues: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Subscription and support \n\n&#160; $ 2,868,808 &#160; &#160; $ 2,126,234 &#160; &#160; $ 1,551,145 &#160; Professional services and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 181,387 &#160; &#160; &#160; 140,305 &#160; &#160; &#160; 105,994 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,050,195 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,266,539 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,657,139 &#160; Cost of revenues: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Subscription and support \n\n&#160; &#160; 494,187 &#160; &#160; &#160; 360,758 &#160; &#160; &#160; 208,243 &#160; Professional services and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 189,392 &#160; &#160; &#160; 128,128 &#160; &#160; &#160; 115,570 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total cost of revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 683,579 &#160; &#160; &#160; 488,886 &#160; &#160; &#160; 323,813 &#160; Gross profit \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,366,616 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,777,653 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,333,326 &#160; Operating expenses: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; &#160; 429,479 &#160; &#160; &#160; 295,347 &#160; &#160; &#160; 187,887 &#160; Marketing and sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,614,026 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,169,610 &#160; &#160; &#160; 792,029 &#160; General and administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 433,821 &#160; &#160; &#160; 347,781 &#160; &#160; &#160; 255,913 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,477,326 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,812,738 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,235,829 &#160; Income (loss) from operations \n\n&#160; &#160; (110,710 ) &#160; &#160; (35,085 ) &#160; &#160; 97,497 &#160; Investment income \n\n&#160; &#160; 19,562 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23,268 &#160; &#160; &#160; 37,735 &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160; (30,948 ) &#160; &#160; (17,045 ) &#160; &#160; (24,909 ) Other expense \n\n&#160; &#160; (5,698 ) &#160; &#160; (4,455 ) &#160; &#160; (6,025 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Income (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes and noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; &#160; (127,794 ) &#160; &#160; (33,317 ) &#160; &#160; 104,298 &#160; Benefit from (provision for) income taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; (142,651 ) &#160; &#160; 21,745 &#160; &#160; &#160; (34,601 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Consolidated net income (loss) \n\n&#160; &#160; (270,445 ) &#160; &#160; (11,572 ) &#160; &#160; 69,697 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5,223 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com \n\n&#160; $ (270,445 ) &#160; $ (11,572 ) &#160; $ 64,474 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; As of January 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Balance Sheet Data: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; $ 1,758,285 &#160; &#160; $ 1,447,174 &#160; &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,862,995 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,380,295 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013 and $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012.

##TABLE_END Total revenues were $3.1 billion for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.3 billion during the same period a year ago, an increase of $783.7 million, or 35 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. \n\nRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $200.2 million, or 28 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to the same period a year ago. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance \n\nDollars \n\n&#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Subscription and support \n\n&#160; $ 494,187 &#160; &#160; $ 360,758 &#160; &#160; $ 133,429 &#160; Professional services and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 189,392 &#160; &#160; &#160; 128,128 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61,264 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total cost of revenues \n\n&#160; $ 683,579 &#160; &#160; $ 488,886 &#160; &#160; $ 194,693 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $683.6 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $488.9 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $194.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $77.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $16.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $36.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $37.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $17.2 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets and an increase of $14.6 million in allocated overhead. We have increased our headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2012 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. \n\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. \n\nResearch and Development. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance \n\nDollars \n\n&#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 429,479 &#160; &#160; $ 295,347 &#160; &#160; $ 134,132 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $429.5 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013, compared to $295.3 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $134.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $92.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.4 million in stock-based expenses and an increase of $8.8 million in our development and test data center. We increased our research and development headcount by 36 percent since January 31, 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. \n\nWe expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2014 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketing and Sales. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Marketing and sales \n\n&#160; $ 1,614,026 &#160; &#160; $ 1,169,610 &#160; &#160; $ 444,416 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 53 % &#160; &#160; 52 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $1.6 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $1.2 billion, or 52 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $444.4 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $305.9 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $83.6 million in stock-based expenses, $29.3 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and $23.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. \n\nGeneral and Administrative. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; General and administrative \n\n&#160; $ 433,821 &#160; &#160; $ 347,781 &#160; &#160; $ 86,040 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; ##TABLE_END General and administrative expenses were $433.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013, compared to $347.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $86.0 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $56.2 million in employee-related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in stock-based expenses. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 15 percent since January 31, 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth. \n\nLoss from operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Loss from operations \n\n&#160; $ (110,710 ) &#160; $ (35,085 ) &#160; $ (75,625 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (4 )% &#160; &#160; (2 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Loss from operations during fiscal 2013 was $110.7 million and included $379.4 million of stock-based expenses and $88.2 million of amortization of purchased intangibles.

Investment income was $19.6 million during fiscal 2013 and was $23.3 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to the same period a year ago. \n\nInterest expense. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (30,948 ) &#160; $ (17,045 ) &#160; $ (13,903 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (1 )% &#160; &#160; (1 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $30.9 million during fiscal 2013 and was $17.0 million during the same period a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we capitalized $2.4 million of interest costs related to capital projects. Capitalized interest during the same period a year ago was $14.6 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to the same period a year ago. \n\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Benefit from (provision for) income taxes \n\n&#160; $ (142,651 ) &#160; $ 21,745 &#160; &#160; $ (164,396 ) Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; (112 )% &#160; &#160; 65 % &#160; ##TABLE_END We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million during fiscal 2013, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent. The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. \n\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. See Note 8 &#147;Income Taxes&#148; to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. \n\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to fiscal 2011. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2012 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2011. Professional services and other revenues were $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $106.0 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. \n\nRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, an increase of $204.1 million, or 39 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by $36.9 million compared to fiscal 2011. \n\nCost of Revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Subscription and support \n\n&#160; $ 360,758 &#160; &#160; $ 208,243 &#160; &#160; $ 152,515 &#160; Professional services and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 128,128 &#160; &#160; &#160; 115,570 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,558 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total cost of revenues \n\n&#160; $ 488,886 &#160; &#160; $ 323,813 &#160; &#160; $ 165,073 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; &#160; 20 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $488.9 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, an increase of $165.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $20.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.3 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $39.8 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $68.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $44.6 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets, an increase of $24.2 million in \n\n&#160; \n\noutside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $5.5 million in allocated overhead. Gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved during fiscal 2012 primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. \n\nResearch and Development. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 295,347 &#160; &#160; $ 187,887 &#160; &#160; $ 107,460 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $295.3 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, an increase of $107.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $66.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $27.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in our development and test data center, an increase of $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of $8.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 52 percent in fiscal 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $255.6 million in employee-related costs, $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, $22.5 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $21.8 million in allocated overhead, $8.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, $3.1 million in depreciation and amortization and the preliminary settlement of the California wage and hour case. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 44 percent in fiscal 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

Investment income was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012 and was $37.7 million during fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in realized gains from sales of marketable securities, the decrease in marketable securities balances and lower interest rates. \n\nInterest expense. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (17,045 ) &#160; $ (24,909 ) &#160; $ 7,864 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (1 )% &#160; &#160; (2 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases.

During fiscal 2012, we capitalized $14.6 million of interest costs related to capital projects, specifically costs related to our real estate holdings, which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. Capitalized interest during fiscal 2011 was $4.0 million. \n\nOther expense. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Other expense \n\n&#160; $ (4,455 ) &#160; $ (6,025 ) &#160; $ 1,570 &#160; ##TABLE_END Other expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses resulting from strategic investment activity and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense decreased primarily due to the net gain of $2.9 million from activity within our portfolio of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies offset by realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (In thousands) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Benefit (provision) for income taxes \n\n&#160; $ 21,745 &#160; &#160; $ (34,601 ) &#160; $ 56,346 &#160; Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 65 % &#160; &#160; 33 % &#160; ##TABLE_END The benefit for income taxes was $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, compared to an income tax provision of $34.6 million during fiscal 2011. \n\nOur effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for fiscal 2011. The higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and California tax credits and a tax benefit related to the May 2011 acquisition of Radian6. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in the foreign tax rate differential. Foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pre-tax income. The combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate. \n\nThe lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items. First, California enacted several income tax law changes, which generally benefited California-based companies. The result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate. Second, the Company was subject to minimum state taxes, which reduced the state tax benefit. The combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit. Note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 to re-value the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences related to this tax law change. \n\nWe also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively. The Singapore program, however, is eligible for renewal. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncement \n\nIn July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02, Intangibles&#151;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)&#151;Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment &#160;(ASU 2012-02), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not required. We plan to adopt ASU 2012-02 in fiscal 2014 and do not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nAt January 31, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion and accounts receivable of $872.6 million. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $736.9 million during fiscal 2013 and $591.5 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. \n\nAs described above in &#147;Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,&#148; our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Additionally, due to continually increased annual cycle billing patterns, the value of customer billings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to a higher accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of January 31, 2013 than as of January 31, 2012. \n\nWe generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. \n\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities increased $145.4 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts which include the establishment of the tax valuation allowance during the year. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $938.9 million during fiscal 2013 and $489.7 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2013 primarily related to the purchase of Rypple, Inc. (&#147;Rypple&#148;) in February 2012, the purchase of Buddy in August 2012, the purchase of GoInstant, Inc. (&#147;GoInstant&#148;) in September 2012, capital expenditures, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $334.5 million during fiscal 2013 and $75.9 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of $351.4 million of proceeds from equity plans and $14.9 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans offset by $31.8 million of principal payments on capital leases. \n\nIn January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the &#147;Note Hedges&#148;) and separate warrant transactions (the &#147;Warrants&#148;). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. To date, there has been a nominal amount of conversions. \n\nFor 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2012, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holders&#146; option for the quarter ending January 31, 2013. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will be convertible at the holders&#146; option for the quarter ending April 30, 2013, and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. \n\nAs of January 31, 2013, we have a total of $60.8 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2030. \n\nWe do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. \n\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2013, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In thousands) \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; Payments Due by Period &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; &#160; More than 5 Years &#160; Capital lease obligations \n\n&#160; $ 66,853 &#160; &#160; $ 31,694 &#160; &#160; $ 22,400 &#160; &#160; $ 12,759 &#160; &#160; $ 0 &#160; Operating lease obligations: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Facilities space \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,505,059 &#160; &#160; &#160; 108,301 &#160; &#160; &#160; 233,378 &#160; &#160; &#160; 250,428 &#160; &#160; &#160; 912,952 &#160; Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures \n\n&#160; &#160; 81,356 &#160; &#160; &#160; 43,046 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38,310 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; Convertible Senior Notes, including interest \n\n&#160; &#160; 583,626 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,313 &#160; &#160; &#160; 579,313 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; Contractual commitments \n\n&#160; &#160; 7,072 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,472 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,600 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 2,243,966 &#160; &#160; $ 190,826 &#160; &#160; $ 877,001 &#160; &#160; $ 263,187 &#160; &#160; $ 912,952 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. \n\nPurchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. \n\nDuring fiscal 2014 and future fiscal years, we expect to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013 as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. \n\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. \n\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), &#147;Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,&#148; defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. \n\nNon-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income \n\nWe use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. These certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. \n\nWe define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Stock-Based Expenses . The Company&#146;s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#146;s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer&#146;s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company&#146;s $575 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010. The imputed interest rate is approximately 5.9%, while the coupon interest rate is 0.75%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management&#146;s assessment of the Company&#146;s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company&#146;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; One-time Tax Charge . As a result of the Company assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; expense to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of those assets. The Company applied significant judgment as part of this analysis including considering the Company&#146;s past operating results, cumulative losses and forecasts of future taxable income. As part of establishing a valuation allowance with respect to the company&#146;s deferred tax assets, the company will assess and record any necessary quarterly changes to the valuation allowance and the corresponding income tax expense or benefit. Management believes that the exclusion of this non-cash charge is appropriate to provide investors with a better view of the company&#146;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Income Tax Effects and Adjustments . The Company&#146;s non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal year&#146;s ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Company&#146;s operational performance \n\n##TABLE_END We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. \n\nWe define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. \n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share \n\nManagement uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. \n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. \n\nLimitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures \n\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. \n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOur reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, &#147;gross profit,&#148; &#147;income (loss) from operations,&#148; &#147;net income (loss)&#148; and &#147;Diluted earnings (loss) per share&#148; for the years ended January 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 are as follows (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;
