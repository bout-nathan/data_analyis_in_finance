report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management&#8217;s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;assume&#8221; and &#8220;continue,&#8221; as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management&#8217;s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends and stock repurchases. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. \n\nOverview \n\nThe following management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (MD&#38;A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen&#8217;s business. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&#38;A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). \n\nWe are a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. Our medicines help millions of patients in the fight against cancer, kidney disease, RA, bone disease and other serious illnesses. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. \n\nWe earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. Our principal products include Neulasta &#174; , NEUPOGEN &#174; , ENBREL, Aranesp &#174; , EPOGEN &#174; , XGEVA &#174; &#32;and Prolia &#174; . For additional information about our products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business &#8212; Marketed Products. \n\nIn 2012, we had several notable accomplishments, including achieving 11% revenue growth driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 9% in the United States and 7% in the ROW. We also continued paying quarterly dividends in 2012, and in December, we declared a dividend of $0.47 per share of common stock payable in March 2013, representing a 31% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the past four quarters. Additionally, we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion in 2012. Under our $10 billion authorized stock repurchase program announced in October 2011, we have repurchased a total of 146 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $9.7 billion at an average price of $66.37. Finally, we made significant advances in our product pipeline in 2012 including advancing AMG 145, brodalumab, romosozumab and rilotumumab to phase 3 clinical trials. \n\nWe enter 2013 with various opportunities to continue growing our business. We believe the currently approved indications for XGEVA &#174; &#32;and Prolia &#174; &#32;represent significant commercial opportunities. Longer-term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our later stage pipeline, by expansion into emerging markets and Japan, and through strategic business development opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Micromet and MN in 2012. Our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies will assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities. \n\nOur business will, however, continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. In the United States, ENBREL, EPOGEN &#174; &#32;and XGEVA &#174; , in particular, will be facing increased competition. Additionally, over the next several years, starting in 2013, certain of the existing patents on our principal products &#8212; including NEUPOGEN &#174; , EPOGEN &#174; and Aranesp &#174; &#8212; will expire and, as a result, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars. For additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents for various products, see Item 1. Business &#8212; Marketed Products. \n\nCurrent global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce health care costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of the economic condition, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain European countries also. \n\nOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses. Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&#38;D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy before and after products have been launched. \n\nFinally, our product sales are subject to certain influences throughout the year, including wholesaler and end-user buying patterns (e.g., wholesaler and end-user stocking, contract-driven buying and patients delaying certain purchasing or physician visits). Such factors can result in higher demand for our products and/or higher wholesaler inventory levels and, therefore, higher product sales for a given three-month period, generally followed by a decline in product sales in the subsequent three-month period. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 can be slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three-month period. &#32; While this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis, these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended March 31 with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year. \n\nSee Item 1. Business &#8212; Marketed Products and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. \n\nSelected financial information \n\nThe following is an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition (in millions, except percentages and per share data): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n$ \n\n12,815 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,725 \n\nROW \n\n3,824 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,570 \n\nTotal product sales \n\n16,639 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n15,295 \n\nOther revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n$ \n\n17,265 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,582 \n\nOperating expenses \n\n$ \n\n11,688 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,270 \n\nOperating income \n\n$ \n\n5,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,312 \n\nNet income \n\n$ \n\n4,345 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,683 \n\nDiluted EPS \n\n$ \n\n5.52 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.04 \n\nDiluted shares \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n* Change in excess of 100% \n\nWhen discussing changes in product sales below, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. \n\nThe increase in U.S. product sales for 2012 reflects growth across the portfolio except ESAs, which declined 10%. Excluding ESAs, U.S. product sales increased 16% driven primarily by unit growth and, to a lesser extent, increases in average net sales prices. The increase in ROW product sales for 2012 reflects growth for all of our marketed products except Aranesp &#174; , which declined 4%, and combined Neulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; , which declined 9%. \n\nThe increase in other revenues for 2012 was driven by a modification to our Takeda collaboration, which replaced a global co-development and profit share agreement for motesanib, originally signed in 2008, with an exclusive license for Takeda to \n\ndevelop, manufacture and commercialize motesanib. That modification resulted in revenue recognition of $232 million. The increase also reflects milestone payments received from AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc. \n\nOperating expenses in 2011 included a previously disclosed charge for a legal settlement reserve of $780 million. \n\nThe increase in net income for 2012 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by higher interest expense, net, and higher effective income tax rates. \n\nThe increase in diluted EPS for 2012 was driven primarily by increases in net income and by the favorable impacts of our stock repurchase program, which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted EPS. \n\nAlthough changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. \n\nCommencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). &#32;In February 2013, the Puerto Rico government proposed an amendment to the excise tax legislation which, if approved, would increase the excise tax rate to 4% effective July 1, 2013 through 2017. &#32;We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. This excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit. As a result of the excise tax in 2012 , cost of sales increased by $343 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $337 million and EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.01. In 2011, cost of sales increased by $211 million, the provision for income taxes was reduced by $321 million and EPS was favorably impacted by $0.12. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $24.1 billion, and total debt outstanding was $26.5 billion. Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2012 , approximately $18.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nProduct sales \n\nWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nNeulasta &#174; /NEUPOGEN &#174; \n\n$ \n\n5,352 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,212 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,844 \n\nENBREL \n\n4,236 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,534 \n\nAranesp &#174; \n\n2,040 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,303 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,486 \n\nEPOGEN &#174; \n\n1,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,040 \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,524 \n\nXGEVA &#174; \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\nProlia &#174; \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\nOther products \n\n1,850 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,485 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,231 \n\nTotal product sales \n\n$ \n\n16,639 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,295 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,660 \n\nTotal U.S. \n\n$ \n\n12,815 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,725 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,254 \n\nTotal ROW \n\n3,824 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,570 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,406 \n\nTotal product sales \n\n$ \n\n16,639 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,295 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,660 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n* Change in excess of 100% \n\nFuture sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Item 1.

Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 14.5% of product sales compared with 15.1% for 2010. The decrease was driven by improved productivity, offset partially by certain expenses related to actions to improve cost efficiencies. \n\nResearch and development \n\nR&#38;D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems&#8217; costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&#38;D with alternative future uses. R&#38;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&#38;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&#38;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. \n\nThe Company groups all of its R&#38;D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences, (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products.

Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nR&#38;D expense by category was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDiscovery Research and Translational Sciences \n\n$ \n\n1,137 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,125 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,154 \n\nLater stage clinical programs \n\n1,285 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketed products \n\n&#160; \n\n1,059 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal R&#38;D expense \n\n$ \n\n3,380 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,167 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,894 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2012 was driven primarily by an increase of $302 million in our later stage clinical programs, including AMG 145 and romosozumab; and an increase of $12 million in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed product support of $101 million. \n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2011 was driven primarily by an increase of $151 million in our marketed product support driven largely by our continued support for Prolia &#174; &#32;and XGEVA &#174; &#32;which, subsequent to their approvals during 2010, were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs; and an increase of $151 million in our later stage clinical program support, including AMG 386, ganitumab (AMG 479), talimogene laherparepvec and AMG 145, offset partially by decreased support for Prolia &#174; &#32;and XGEVA &#174; &#32;as a result of their aforementioned approvals. These increases were offset partially by a decrease of $29 million in our Discovery Research and Translational Sciences activities, due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to R&#38;D technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years. \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&#38;A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&#38;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or when we become entitled to the cost recovery. Beginning January 1, 2011, SG&#38;A expenses also include the annual U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee. \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2012 was driven primarily by higher ENBREL profit share expenses of $207 million as well as international expansion of $87 million, offset partially by lower U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee expense of $106 million in 2012 compared with 2011, which includes a $61 million favorable adjustment related to the 2011 fee. \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2011 was driven primarily by the U.S. healthcare reform estimated federal excise fee of $151 million; higher ENBREL profit share expense of $104 million; increased expenses related to the launches of Prolia &#174; &#32;and XGEVA &#174; &#32;and expansion of our international operations of $89 million; and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $67 million. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the expenses associated with the ENBREL profit share were $1,495 million, $1,288 million and $1,184 million, respectively. \n\nOther \n\nOther operating expenses for 2012 included certain charges related to our cost savings initiatives of $175 million, which includes severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal proceedings charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, which includes adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to a prior-year business combination. \n\nOther operating expenses for 2011 included primarily a legal settlement charge of $780 million and certain charges related to cost savings initiatives, primarily severance, of $109 million. \n\nIn 2010, we recorded a $118 million asset impairment charge for our manufacturing operations located in Fremont, California, associated with our efforts to optimize our network of manufacturing facilities and improve cost efficiencies. \n\nSee Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our 2011 legal settlement. \n\nNon-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes \n\nNon-operating expenses/income and provisions for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n$ \n\n1,053 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nInterest and other income, net \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nProvisions for income taxes \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n13.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInterest expense, net \n\nIncluded in interest expense, net, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, is the impact of non-cash interest expense of $140 million, $143 million and $266 million, respectively, on our convertible debt. The increase of interest expense in 2012 was due primarily to a higher average debt balance. \n\nInterest and other income, net \n\nThe increase in interest and other income, net, for 2012 was due primarily to higher interest income due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities offset partially by lower yields and lower net gains realized on investments. \n\nThe increase in interest and other income, net, for 2011 was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2012 was due primarily to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses and the exclusion of the federal R&#38;D tax credit in 2012, offset partially by the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years. Because the ATRA of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act which will retroactively benefit the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the reinstatement of the R&#38;D tax credit for 2012, cannot be recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead will be reflected in the company's 2013 financial results for the first quarter. The tax benefit of the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 R&#38;D tax credit that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 is approximately $65 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2012, we also settled the examination of our U.S. tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service relating to years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009. We will recognize the tax \n\nimpact of this settlement in the first quarter of 2013. We expect the settlement to result in a tax benefit of approximately $185 million. \n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2011 was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee in 2011, the non-deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in 2011 and the favorable resolution in 2010 of certain prior years' non-routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities. \n\nCommencing January 1, 2011, Puerto Rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the purchase of goods and services from a related manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is imposed on the gross intercompany purchase price of the goods and services and is effective for a six-year period beginning in 2011, with the excise tax rate declining in each year (4% in 2011, 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in 2013, 2.5% in 2014, 2.25% in 2015 and 1% in 2016). &#32;In February 2013, the Puerto Rico government proposed an amendment to the excise tax legislation which, if approved, would increase the excise tax rate to 4% effective July 1, 2013 through 2017. &#32;We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred. The effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 would have been approximately 18.7% and 18.0%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. \n\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. \n\nSee Summary of Critical Accounting Policies &#8212; Income taxes and Note 4, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSelected financial data was as follows as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 &#32;(in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n$ \n\n24,061 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,641 \n\nTotal assets \n\n54,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n48,871 \n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt \n\n2,495 \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt \n\n24,034 \n\n&#160; \n\n21,344 \n\nStockholders&#8217; equity \n\n19,060 \n\n&#160; \n\n19,029 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers, and market transactions. Whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock, the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock). During 2011, we repurchased a total of 144 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion. In October 2011, we announced our intent to accelerate our repurchase program and that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program to $10 billion. Subsequent to this authorization through December 31, 2011, we repurchased 83 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. During 2012 , we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion. This brings the total of shares repurchased under this approved $10 billion authorization to 146 million at a total cost of $9.7 billion at an average cost of $66.37 per share. In December 2012, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization by $2.0 billion, and as of December 31, 2012 , $2.3 &#32; billion remained available under this stock repurchase program, which is expected to cover our share repurchase activity into 2014. \n\nIn February 2013, our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes matured/converted, and accordingly, the $2.5 billion principal amount was settled in cash. We also elected to pay the note holders who converted their notes &#32; $99 million &#32;of cash for the excess conversion value, as allowed by the original terms of the no tes, which was offset by the receipt of the same amount of cash from the counterparty to the related convertible note hedge. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these convertible notes. \n\nIn April 2011, the Board of Directors approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.28 per share of common stock in July and October 2011, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $500 million in 2011. In December 2011, the Board of Directors declared a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 per share of common stock, resulting in dividend payments aggregating $ 1.1 &#32;billion in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors declared a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.47 per share of common stock, payable in March 2013. \n\nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in each case for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as &#8220;U.S. funds&#8221;) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. \n\nA significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2012 , accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $400 million, of which $281 million was past due, with the past due receivables primarily in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. \n\nOver the next several years, certain of the existing patents on our principal products will expire. As a result, we expect to face increasing competition thereafter, including from biosimilars, which may have a material adverse impact on our product sales, results of operations and liquidity. In the EU, there is already an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars and we are facing increasing competition from biosimilars. The 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars under a new, abbreviated pathway. (See Item 1. Business &#8212; Marketed Products.) In the United States after patent expiration, we expect to face greater competition than today, including from manufacturers with biosimilars approved in Europe that may seek to obtain U.S. approval. We have many opportunities to grow our business, including the continued commercialization of XGEVA &#174; &#32;and Prolia &#174; &#32;and expansion into emerging markets and Japan, which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products' patent expiries. \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\nOf our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 31, 2012 , approximately $18.9 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. \n\nThe primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. \n\nFinancing arrangements \n\nThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 , were $ 2.5 &#32;billion and $ 24.0 &#32;billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2011 , were $ 84 &#32;million and $ 21.3 &#32;billion, respectively. \n\nWe issued debt securities in various offerings during the three years ended December 31, 2012 , including $5.0 billion, $10.5 billion and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amounts of notes in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\nIn 2012, we repaid $ 123 &#32;million of debt, including the redemption of all of our outstanding zero-coupon convertible notes due in 2032 and debt assumed in the acquisition of MN and deCODE Genetics. In February 2011, our 0.125% 2011 Convertible Notes became due, and we repaid the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount. No debt was due or repaid in 2010. \n\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2011, we had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion, which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. \n\nTo hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion and $748 million, respectively. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. \n\nIn December 2011, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. \n\nIn March 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in April 2011. This shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in March 2014. \n\nIn 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. \n\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2012 . \n\nSee Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. \n\nCash flows \n\nOur cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n$ \n\n5,882 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,119 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,787 \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n(9,990 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(786 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,152 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(674 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,232 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating \n\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2012 &#32;due primarily to the timing and amount of receipts from customers, an increase in net income, timing of payments to vendors and taxing authorities, cash received in connection with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements of $397 million and the impact of decreased inventory-related expenditures. These increases were offset partially by a payment associated with the previously disclosed litigation settlement. Cash provided by operating activities during 2011 &#32;decreased due primarily to increased interest payments, working capital increases related to the launch of Prolia &#174; &#32;and XGEVA &#174; &#32;and the prepayment of certain royalties. \n\nInvesting \n\nCapital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Ireland and Puerto Rico, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 689 &#32;million, $ 567 &#32;million and $ 580 &#32;million in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. We currently estimate 2013 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $700 million. \n\nCash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2012 &#32;and 2011 , also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 2.4 &#32;billion and $ 701 &#32;million, respectively. \n\nNet purchases of marketable securities were $ 6.9 &#32;billion for 2012 , compared to net proceeds of $ 437 &#32;million for 2011 &#32;and net purchases of $ 3.5 &#32;billion for 2010 . \n\nFinancing \n\nCash provided by financing activities during 2012 &#32;was due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $ 4.9 &#32;billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 1.3 &#32;billion, offset partially by repurchases of our common stock of $ 4.6 &#32;billion and the payment of dividends of $ 1.1 &#32;billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2011 was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $8.3 billion, including $5 billion purchased in a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2011; repayment of long-term debt of $2.5 billion; and payment of dividends of $500 million, offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $10.4 billion, including $7.5 billion issued in November and December 2011 , in part, to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified Dutch auction tender offer. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 &#32;was due to the repurchases of our common stock of $3.8 billion, offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2.5 billion. \n\nSee Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders&#8217; equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. \n\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 , aggregated by type (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments due by period \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear \n\n&#160; \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nYears \n\nContractual obligations \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2 and 3 \n\n&#160; \n\n4 and 5 \n\n&#160; \n\n6 and beyond \n\nLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) \n\n$ \n\n44,885 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,601 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,114 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,048 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,122 \n\nOperating lease obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase obligations (3) \n\n2,921 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,015 \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (4) \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n$ \n\n48,547 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,554 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,982 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,587 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n32,424 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nLong-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt issued in 2012 and 2011, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling/euros to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we u sed the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nInterest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2012 . See Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nPurchase obligations relate primarily to (i) our long-term supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity; (ii) R&#38;D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nLiabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2012 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the BioVex contingent consideration, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2012 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $2.5 billion, including $575 million in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. See Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nProduct sales and sales deductions \n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, &#8220;sales deductions&#8221;) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. \n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nRebates \n\n&#160; \n\nChargebacks \n\n&#160; \n\nOther deductions \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nBalance as of January 1, 2010 \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nAmounts charged against product sales \n\n1,861 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,593 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,034 \n\nPayments \n\n(1,724 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,548 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(588 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,860 \n\n) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2010 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,144 \n\nAmounts charged against product sales \n\n1,795 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,626 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,091 \n\nPayments \n\n(1,592 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,600 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(717 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,909 \n\n) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2011 \n\n1,047 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,326 \n\nAmounts charged against product sales \n\n1,480 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,709 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,848 \n\nPayments \n\n(1,680 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,741 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(624 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,045 \n\n) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2012 \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,129 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , total sales deductions were 23%, 25% and 25% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2012 . \n\nIn the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in the EU are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. \n\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. \n\nRebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. We estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold, contractual terms, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. Additionally, for Medicaid rebates, we consider the estimated patient population and the amount of unbilled managed Medicaid claims. We adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which for certain rebates can take up to one year and more than one year for certain government programs. Rebate accruals totaled $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 10% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and less than 5% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2012 &#32;would have had an impact of approximately $150 million, or approximately 1% of our 2012 &#32;product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. \n\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. \n\nProduct returns \n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1.5% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nThe Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income, applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. \n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. \n\nCertain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. \n\nThe Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company&#8217;s pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company&#8217;s operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company&#8217;s foreign income associated with the Company&#8217;s operations conducted in Puerto Rico. \n\nIf future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. \n\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. \n\nContingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable \n\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. \n\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\nValuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations \n\nWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&#38;D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndetermining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprojecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nestimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndeveloping appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of BioVex (see Note 2, Business combinations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. \n\nWe believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. \n\nImpairment of long-lived assets \n\nWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, composed primarily of IPR&#38;D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. \n\nEstimating future cash flows of an IPR&#38;D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&#38;D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&#38;D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&#38;D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 115, "Negative": 130, "Polarity": -0.06122448954602249, "Subjectivity": 0.04686304513258167}, "similarity_score": 0.7913058320571433, "nlp_result": 0}
