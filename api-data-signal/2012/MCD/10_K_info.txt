Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS \n\nThe Company franchises and operates McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. Of the 34,480 &#32;restaurants in 119 &#32;countries at year-end 2012 , 27,882 &#32;were franchised or licensed (including 19,869 &#32;franchised to conventional franchisees, 4,350 &#32;licensed to developmental licensees and 3,663 &#32;licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")&#8212;primarily Japan) and 6,598 &#32;were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&#233;cor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. \n\nWe view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised or licensed (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. \n\nThe business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (\"U.S.\"), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (\"APMEA\"). In addition, throughout this report we present &#8220;Other Countries &#38; Corporate&#8221; that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32% , 39% &#32;and 23% &#32;of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), France and Germany, collectively, account for 51% of Europe&#8217;s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 56% of APMEA&#8217;s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as &#8220;major markets&#8221; throughout this report and comprise 70% &#32;of total revenues. \n\nIn analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including \n\n&#160;\n\ncomparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company&#8217;s underlying business trends. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company&#8217;s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. \n\n##TABLE_END McDonald&#8217;s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company&#8217;s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nReturn on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. \n\n##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\nThe strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's success. This business model enables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. \n\n10 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report \n\nMcDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (\"Plan\") provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five pillars of our Plan&#8212;People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion&#8212;we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown global comparable sales and guest counts in each of the last nine years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders since its inception. To measure our performance as we continue to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSystemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nOperating income growth of 6% to 7%; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nROIIC in the high teens. \n\n##TABLE_END Prior to 2012, we exceeded each of these financial targets every year since the Plan's implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. These targets have enabled us to make the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders, and we believe they remain realistic and sustainable for a company of our size. \n\nIn 2012, Systemwide sales growth was 3% (5% in constant currencies), operating income growth was 1% (4% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was 15.4% and three-year ROIIC was 28.6% (see reconciliation on page 24). Persistent global economic headwinds, heightened competitive activity and inflationary costs impacted results. In addition, planned strategic decisions, such as the 2012 London Olympics sponsorship, investing in technology and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator convention, also impacted results. \n\nIn 2012, we continued to focus on customers' needs and remained aligned on our Plan and the three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our brand. We believe these priorities are relevant and actionable, and combined with our competitive advantages, will drive long-term sustainable growth. Initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with customers and drove increases in global comparable sales and guest counts of 3.1% and 1.6%, respectively, despite challenging economies and a relatively flat or declining Informal Eating Out (\"IEO\") segment in most markets. In 2012, we continued to grow market share in the U.S., Europe and APMEA, amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable guest counts. \n\nComparable sales are impacted by guest counts, product mix shifts and menu pricing. Specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors, notably food away from home and food at home inflation indices. In our Company-operated restaurants, we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points, increase profitability and mitigate inflation, all while trying to grow guest counts. In order to accomplish these objectives, we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price and product mix. Franchisees also have access to, and many utilize, this strategic pricing tool. In general, we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy. We look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry-point value, core, premium and promotional offerings. We also introduce new products to meet customers' needs, which can expand average check and increase guest counts. In 2012, average prices increased at Company-operated restaurants in each area of the world, although increases varied by market and region. \n\nU.S. \n\nIn the U.S., comparable sales increased for the tenth consecutive year, rising 3.3% in 2012, while comparable guest counts rose \n\n&#160;\n\n1.9%. These results were achieved despite only modest growth in the IEO segment and heightened competitive activity. In the second half of the year, we experienced softer performance; therefore, we adjusted our plans to re-energize our all-day everyday value offerings while providing the menu variety customers expect from McDonald's. \n\nIn 2012, we continued to highlight beverages, value, breakfast, and our classic core favorites. We expanded our McCaf&#233; beverage offerings with the Chocolate Chip Frapp&#233; and Cherry Berry Chiller. Limited-time offers, such as Chicken McBites and the Cheddar Bacon Onion premium sandwiches, complemented our core menu offerings. \n\nModernizing the customer experience continued through our major remodeling initiative, which provides contemporary restaurant designs and retailing efforts. The enhanced appearance and functionality of our restaurants deliver a more relevant experience for our customers. Over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2012 with the majority adding drive-thru capacity to capture additional guest counts. \n\nWe broadened the accessibility of our convenient locations through extended hours and efficient drive-thru service. More than half of our restaurants use some form of multiple order points to maximize drive-thru capacity, including 1,500 with hand-held order takers to help improve customer service times. To further build on our competitive advantage, we focused on operations excellence initiatives to drive customer satisfaction as we strive to deliver fast, accurate and friendly service with every order. \n\nEurope \n\nIn Europe, comparable sales rose 2.4%, marking the ninth consecutive year of comparable sales increases, while guest counts declined 0.5%. While low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect overall retail sales and the IEO segment, we outperformed the market and grew market share. Major contributors to comparable sales were the U.K. and Russia. Despite ongoing economic challenges, the segment's priority remains growing the overall business by balancing a strong focus on our unique value offerings, ongoing premium product innovation, and new products. \n\nEurope continued to see the benefit of providing a relevant, contemporary customer experience and completed almost 750 restaurant reimages. By the end of 2012, over 90% of restaurant interiors and approximately 50% of exteriors had been reimaged. Europe also invested in a roll-out of a new point-of-sale system, which allows us to continue to expand our menu offerings and improve order accuracy. By the end of 2012, over 2,200 restaurants had deployed this system. \n\nWe expanded our coffee business and have over 1,600 McCaf&#233; locations, which in Europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees, desserts and snacks. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours, self-order kiosks, optimized drive-thrus, and opened over 250 new restaurants. \n\nAPMEA \n\nIn APMEA, comparable sales rose 1.4% and comparable guest counts rose 2.2%, despite a challenging year of economic pressures, partly due to Japan's uneven recovery and China's slower economic growth. Positive performance was driven by China, Australia and many other markets. Unique value platforms, great tasting premium menu selections, locally-relevant menu variety, and convenience and service enhancements differentiated the McDonald's experience. Australia launched the &#8220;Loose Change Menu,&#8221; which is a branded affordability menu, while China focused on breakfast, lunch, and dinner value platforms. Value initiatives were balanced with mid-tier offers, such as Bubble Tea in China, and premium limited-time offers, such as the Serious Lamb Burger and Wrap in Australia. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 11 \n\nOur breakfast business has expanded and is offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. Desserts continued to play a meaningful role, particularly in China, where we remain one of the largest ice cream retailers. \n\nWe opened over 750 new restaurants in APMEA, of which over 250 were in China, where we have made significant progress toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are offering some form of extended operating hours and over 5,400 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now available in over 1,700 restaurants, including nearly 550 in China. \n\nSince Japan's natural disaster in March of 2011, the economy remains a challenge. Despite a declining IEO segment, McDonald's is gaining market share through a value platform of 100, 250, and 500 YEN offerings, and family sharing boxes, such as 15-piece Chicken McNuggets. Japan augmented its value platform with strategic couponing to encourage add-on and Extra Value Meal purchases. \n\nConsolidated \n\nGlobally, our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and our suppliers' risk management practices to manage costs. We were able to execute our strategies in every area of the world, grow comparable sales and control selling, general and administrative expenses. However, in 2012 we faced top- and bottom-line pressures, some a result of planned strategic decisions, and others driven by the external environment. As a result, combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) was 31.2% in 2012, down 0.4 percentage points as compared to 2011. \n\nIn 2012, cash from operations was nearly $7.0 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $3.0 billion were invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and open new restaurants. Across the System, over 1,400 restaurants were opened and about 2,400 existing locations were reimaged. In addition, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $2.9 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. \n\nCash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages, making McDonald's not just a global brand but also a locally&#8211; relevant one. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nComparable sales grew 3.1% &#32;and guest counts rose 1.6% , building on 2011 &#32;increases of 5.6% &#32;and 3.7% , respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nRevenues increased &#32; 2% &#32;( 5% &#32;in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nOperating income increased &#32; 1% &#32;( 4% &#32;in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nDiluted earnings per share was $5.36 , an increase of 2% &#32;( 5% &#32;in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCash provided by operations was nearly $7.0 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nOne-year ROIIC was 15.4% &#32;and three-year ROIIC was 28.6% &#32;for the period ended December 31, 2012 . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 10% &#32;to $0.77 &#32;for the fourth quarter&#8212;bringing our current annual dividend to $3.08 &#32;per share. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company returned $5.5 billion &#32;to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n\n##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2013 &#32; \n\nWe will continue to build the business in 2013 and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all pillars of our Plan and our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to our brand. We remain focused on seizing the long-term opportunities in the $1 trillion IEO segment by leveraging our competitive advantages. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a resilient business model, and the experience and alignment throughout the McDonald's System to navigate the current environment. \n\nOur number one priority continues to be satisfying our customers' needs by serving great-tasting, high-quality food in contemporary restaurants. This focus on our customers is particularly critical in this uncertain environment, where ongoing volatility continues to negatively impact consumer sentiment and spending. We anticipate a continued flat to declining IEO segment in many of the markets where we operate. Growing market share will remain our focus to attain sustainable and profitable long-term growth. \n\nWe will highlight promotions of our core menu favorites, while strategically expanding our menu with relevant new offerings across all dayparts, including premium products that can deliver a higher average check. We will place an even greater emphasis on scaling success quickly around the globe. For example, in many markets we will expand our innovative McBites line-up, introduce existing products like our blended ice beverages and large McWraps into new markets, and offer even more of the unique, flavor-based promotional food events that have been successful. We will emphasize our dayparts&#8212;like breakfast and extended hours&#8212;that are still growing globally in both established and emerging markets. We will enhance the customer experience by continuing to reimage our building interiors and exteriors and by providing our restaurant teams with the appropriate tools, training, and technology. The accessibility efforts will include increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers through new restaurant openings, extended operating hours, stronger value platforms, and faster, more accurate service through innovative order taking. With operational and financial discipline, we will execute these priorities to increase McDonald's brand relevance. \n\nWe will continue to build customer trust through our commitment to sustainability&#8212;including nutrition and well-being, a sustainable supply chain, environmental responsibility, employee experience, and the community. \n\nU.S. \n\nIn 2013, the U.S. business will focus on driving sales and guest counts by enhancing the entire customer experience through the pillars of the Plan and the three global priorities. Our menu pipeline is more balanced in 2013, with a continued focus on great taste, quality ingredients and variety. We will satisfy our customers' needs with the food they crave by balancing core favorites with limited time offers and innovative new products across the menu. Menu news will be augmented with brand messages that highlight our quality food ingredients, efforts around promoting children's well-being and community involvement. We will enhance our Dollar Menu and introduce new products to highlight McDonald's value at every price point, across all menu categories. We are continuing our major remodel program by updating about 800 locations in 2013. At the same time, we are continuing to improve \n\n12 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report \n\nrestaurant operations through appropriate staffing and a focus on friendly, accurate service as well as innovative order taking. In addition, we will increase the number of restaurants that operate 24 hours a day and strive to be our customers' favorite eating-out destination. \n\nEurope \n\nIn Europe, we see growth opportunities in breakfast, core menu items, beverages, and extended hours. Our business plans are focused on building market share by emphasizing value across all dayparts and new restaurant growth. In some markets, our value offerings will evolve from a low-end entry price to multiple entry prices across our menu. This value menu evolution is intended to grow guest counts with compelling affordability and enhanced trade-up opportunities through an extended range of options. In 2013, we will reimage approximately 450 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 100% of our interiors and over 85% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of 2015. We will also open nearly 300 restaurants. We will leverage production and service enhancements by optimizing kitchen platforms and accelerating the deployment of technologies, such as updating the point-of-sale system and rolling out multiple order points via self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and side-by-side drive-thrus. These initiatives will enhance the customer experience, help drive guest counts and improve labor efficiency. We will also continue to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools. Despite the near-term headwinds due to economic uncertainty and government-initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries, Europe offers significant long-term opportunity, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this segment's potential. \n\nAPMEA \n\nIn APMEA, we will advance efforts to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink by reinvigorating our long-term value platforms, accelerating growth at breakfast, and focusing on menu variety and convenience. Value will continue to be a key strategy and growth driver to build traffic with a focus across the menu at all dayparts, combined with trade-up strategies to build average check. For example, Australia will evolve its Loose Change Menu, and Japan will focus on building average check through trade-up opportunities with promotional products and a focus on breakfast. We plan to grow breakfast traffic in APMEA through increased marketing efforts, value, accessibility and operations excellence. The markets will continue to balance core and limited-time offers and will execute a series of exciting food events that celebrate our core menu and the segment's all-time favorite product offerings. At the same time, we will continue to leverage the diversity of the segment to identify and scale new products and platforms. Convenience initiatives will focus on optimizing our drive-thru and delivery services through operation efficiencies and online capabilities. In China, for example, a new web-ordering system will enhance the customer experience and drive new demand through delivery. We will grow our business by opening approximately 850 new restaurants and reimaging about 225 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by opening over 300 restaurants, consistent with our goal of reaching 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. \n\nConsolidated \n\nGlobally, we will maintain financial discipline by effectively managing spending. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate acceptable returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less \n\n&#160;\n\ncapital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. \n\nMcDonald's does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company's results: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nChanges in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2.5 percentage points to 2013 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 1,135 net traditional restaurants added in 2012. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nWith about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2013, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.5-2.5% in the U.S. and 3-4% in Europe. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects full-year 2013 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 2-3% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nBased on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2013 to increase approximately 4-6% compared with 2012. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nA significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2013 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. As a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a tax benefit of about $50 million reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits, which may result in a first quarter effective tax rate below the full year range. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company expects capital expenditures for 2013 to be approximately $3.2 billion. Over half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open between 1,500 - 1,600 restaurants including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 1,200 - 1,300 traditional restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, in part through reimaging. More than 1,600 restaurants worldwide are expected to be reimaged, including locations in affiliated and developmental licensee markets that require no capital investment from the Company. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 13 \n\nConsolidated Operating Results \n\n##TABLE_START Operating results \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars in millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,603 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,293 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,233 \n\nRevenues from franchised restaurants \n\n&#160; \n\n8,964 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,713 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,842 \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n27,567 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24,075 \n\nOperating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany-operated restaurant expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n15,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14,838 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13,060 \n\nFranchised restaurants-occupancy expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n1,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,481 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,378 \n\nSelling, general &#38; administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n2,455 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,394 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,333 \n\nImpairment and other charges (credits), net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther operating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n(252 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(233 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(18 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(198 \n\n) \n\nTotal operating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n18,962 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16,602 \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n8,605 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,530 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,473 \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNonoperating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(64 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome before provision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n8,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,012 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,000 \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n2,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,054 \n\nNet income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,465 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,503 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,946 \n\nEarnings per common share&#8212;diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.36 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.27 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.58 \n\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding&#8212; diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n1,020.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,044.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,080.3 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nnm Not meaningful \n\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS \n\nWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald&#8217;s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. \n\nIn 2012, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker Euro, along with most other currencies.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.17 &#32;per share on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. A decrease of 2% &#32;in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2012. \n\nIn 2011, net income increased 11% (7% in constant currencies) to $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased \n\n&#160;\n\n15% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.27. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 per share on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2011 in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, Company-operated margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate.

Revenues in 2011 also benefited from comparable sales increases in France and Germany. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2012 was driven by positive comparable sales in China, Australia and many other markets. The constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China and most other markets. Expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to revenue growth in both periods. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 15 \n\nThe following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases) : \n\n##TABLE_START Comparable sales and guest count increases/(decreases) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nGuest \n\nCounts \n\n&#160; \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nGuest \n\nCounts \n\n&#160; \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nGuest \n\nCounts \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n5.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\nAPMEA \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n6.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\nOther Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n7.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.3 \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Systemwide sales increases/(decreases) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExcluding currency \n\ntranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAPMEA \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFranchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, but are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

The increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses. \n\nIn Europe, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 reflected positive comparable sales and higher occupancy costs. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses. \n\n16 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report \n\nIn APMEA, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 was primarily due to Australia, which was partly impacted by the 2012 change in classification of certain amounts from revenues to restaurant occupancy expenses. Although the change in classification resulted in a decrease to the franchised margin percentage, there was no impact on the reported franchised margin dollars. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for Japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. \n\nThe franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries &#38; Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCompany-operated margins \n\n##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $76 million or 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2012, and increased $282 million or 9% (5% in constant currencies) in 2011. In 2012, Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $97 million, primarily in Europe. On a constant currency basis, the increase in Company-operated margin dollars was due to positive performance in Europe, offset by lower results in APMEA and the U.S. as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs. The growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partly offset by higher costs, primarily commodity costs, in all segments.

Acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the \n\n&#160;\n\nmargin percent in both periods. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time. \n\nSupplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants \n\nWe continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. \n\nWe report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. \n\nWe believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business. Management of the Company considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. \n\nThe following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as &#8220;Store operating margin.&#8221; The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as &#8220;Brand/real estate margin.&#8221; Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald&#8217;s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. \n\nAs shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald&#8217;s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy &#38; other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. \n\nWhile we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general and administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that about $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is the typical cost to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the \n\nU.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 17 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars in millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs reported \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of Company-operated restaurants at \n\nyear end \n\n1,552 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,552 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,550 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,017 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,985 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,005 \n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants \n\n$ \n\n4,530 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,433 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,229 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,850 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,852 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,932 \n\nCompany-operated margin \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,501 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,514 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,373 \n\nStore operating margin \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany-operated margin \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,501 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,514 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,373 \n\nPlus: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutside rent expense (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation&#8212;buildings &#38; leasehold \n\nimprovements (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLess: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRent &#38; royalties (2) \n\n(668 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(651 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(619 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,603 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,598 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,409 \n\n) \n\nStore operating margin \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nBrand/real estate margin \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRent &#38; royalties (2) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,603 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,598 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,409 \n\nLess: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutside rent expense (1) \n\n(59 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(56 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(60 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(245 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(242 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(223 \n\n) \n\nDepreciation&#8212;buildings &#38; leasehold \n\nimprovements (1) \n\n(77 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(69 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(65 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(123 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(118 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(105 \n\n) \n\nBrand/real estate margin \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,235 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,238 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,081 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nRepresents certain costs recorded as occupancy &#38; other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income &#8211; rent payable by McDonald&#8217;s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

Results for 2011 increased primarily due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars, mostly from franchised margin dollars. \n\nIn Europe, results for 2012 were driven by strong operating performance in Russia and the U.K. The segment's constant currency operating results benefited from higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, Company-operated margin dollars. These results also benefited from higher gains on sales of restaurants, primarily in France and Germany, partly offset by incremental selling, general and administrative expenses related to the 2012 London Olympics. Results for 2011 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, the U.K., Russia and Germany, and higher combined restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn APMEA, results for 2012 increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars and gains on sales of restaurants in China to developmental licensees, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars and lower operating results in Japan.

In January 2013, the United States enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (\"Act\"). The Act reinstated, retroactive to January 1, 2012, certain tax benefits that had previously expired. However, in accordance with the financial accounting standards for income taxes, the Company is required to account for the effects of changes in tax laws in the period the legislation is enacted. \n\nIn 2011, the effective income tax rate reflected lower tax benefits related to certain foreign tax credits, partially offset by nonrecurring deferred tax benefits related to certain foreign operations. \n\nConsolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion &#32;in 2012 and 2011. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. \n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nFair value measurements \n\n##TABLE_END In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an update to Topic 820 &#8211; Fair Value Measurement of the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"). This update provides guidance on how fair value accounting should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards and does not extend the use of fair value accounting. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nComprehensive Income \n\n##TABLE_END In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to Topic 220 &#8211; Comprehensive Income of the ASC. The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The Company adopted this new guidance in 2012, as required, and included a separate Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in this Form 10-K. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Cash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\nCash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.9 billion in 2012, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.2 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.4 billion in 2011. In 2012, cash provided by operations decreased $184 million or 3% compared with 2011 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating results. In 2011, cash provided by operations increased $808 million or 13% compared with 2010 primarily due to higher operating results. \n\nCash used for investing activities totaled $3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $596 million compared with 2011. The increase primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, an increase in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits, and lower proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $515 million compared with 2010. This reflected higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. \n\nCash used for financing activities totaled $3.8 billion in 2012, a decrease of $683 million compared with 2011, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases and higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher dividend payments. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $804 million compared with 2010, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, higher dividend payments and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by higher net debt issuances. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at year end 2012 and 2011. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. \n\nRESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n\nIn 2012, the Company opened 1,404 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 269 traditional restaurants and 200 satellite restaurants. In 2011, the Company opened 1,118 traditional restaurants and 32 satellite restaurants, and closed 246 traditional restaurants and 131 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure. \n\nSystemwide restaurants at year end (1) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n14,157 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,098 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,027 \n\nEurope \n\n7,368 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,156 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,969 \n\nAPMEA \n\n9,454 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,865 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,424 \n\nOther Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n3,501 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,391 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,317 \n\nTotal \n\n34,480 \n\n&#160; \n\n33,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n32,737 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nIncludes satellite units at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 as follows: U.S.&#8212;997, 1,084, 1,112; Europe&#8212;246, 240, 239; APMEA (primarily Japan)&#8212;871, 949, 1,010; Other Countries &#38; Corporate&#8212;453, 459, 470. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n20 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report \n\nApproximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and over 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2012.

The higher reinvestment reflects the Company's commitment to grow sales through initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. The increase related to new restaurants reflects our commitment to broaden accessibility to our brand. \n\nCapital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald&#8217;s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.9 &#32;million in 2012. \n\nThe Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2012 and 2011. \n\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS \n\nFor the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. \n\nShares repurchased and dividends &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of shares repurchased \n\n28.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n41.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n37.8 \n\nShares outstanding at year end \n\n1,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,021 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,054 \n\nDividends declared per share \n\n$ \n\n2.87 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.53 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.26 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTreasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) \n\n$ \n\n2,605 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,373 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,648 \n\nDividends paid \n\n2,897 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,408 \n\nTotal returned to shareholders \n\n$ \n\n5,502 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,983 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,056 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nIn September 2009, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date (\"2009 Program\"). As most of the amount authorized under the 2009 Program was utilized, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors terminated the 2009 Program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective August 1, 2012, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2012, approximately 8.4 million shares were repurchased for $ 748 million &#32;under the new program. \n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 37 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2012 full year dividend of $ 2.87 &#32;per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.70 per share, with an increase to $0.77 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.08 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company&#8217;s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\n##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS \n\nTotal assets increased $2.4 billion or 7% in 2012.

Net property and equipment increased $1.8 billion in 2012 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $1.4 billion primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. \n\nOperating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity.

The net increase in 2012 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.2 billion. \n\nDebt highlights (1) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed-rate debt as a percent of total debt (2,3) \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWeighted-average annual interest rate of total debt (3) \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\nForeign currency-denominated debt as a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal debt as a percent of total \n\nCapitalization (total debt and total \n\nShareholders' equity) (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations as a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nAll percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nBased on debt obligations before the effect of fair value hedging adjustments.

There are no provisions in the Company&#8217;s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#8217;s business. Under existing authorization from the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2012, the Company had $5.4 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). Debt maturing in 2013 is approximately $690 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2013, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2012, the Company also had $581 million of foreign currency borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted line of credit agreements. \n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders&#8217; equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company&#8217;s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. \n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2012, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company&#8217;s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company&#8217;s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: \n\nForeign currency net asset exposures \n\n##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nEuro \n\n$ \n\n6,692 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,905 \n\nAustralian Dollars \n\n2,450 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,409 \n\nCanadian Dollars \n\n1,319 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,224 \n\nBritish Pounds Sterling \n\n1,117 \n\n&#160; \n\nRussian Ruble \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company&#8217;s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2012 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2012 levels would materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. \n\nLIQUIDITY \n\nThe Company has significant operations outside the United States where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company \n\n22 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report \n\nhas made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on the undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. \n\nConsistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. \n\nWhile the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2012. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further details. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nContractual cash outflows \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual cash inflows \n\n&#160; \n\nIn millions \n\nOperating \n\nleases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDebt \n\nobligations (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMinimum rent under \n\nfranchise arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,352 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,562 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,259 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,484 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,130 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,382 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,020 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,261 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,053 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,130 \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n6,844 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n17,047 \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,523 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,590 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,866 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nThe maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.5 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in November 2016. Debt obligations do not include $42 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $217 million of accrued interest. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2012, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $493 million, and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $482 million . \n\nThere are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company&#8217;s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START Other Matters \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nManagement&#8217;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. \n\nThe Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nProperty and equipment \n\n##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management&#8217;s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nShare-based compensation \n\n##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. \n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock over the expected \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 23 \n\nlife and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLong-lived assets impairment review \n\n##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company&#8217;s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company&#8217;s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLitigation accruals \n\n##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after \n\ncareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nIncome taxes \n\n##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. \n\nThe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns \n\n&#160;\n\nare currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2013. \n\nDeferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.8 billion &#32;related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. \n\nEFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES&#8212;INFLATION \n\nThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. \n\nRECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL \n\nROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company&#8217;s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. \n\nThe denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter&#8217;s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2012 &#32;investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2012 &#32;investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2011 &#32;is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2012 &#32;operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2011 &#32;investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. \n\nThe reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: \n\n24 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report \n\nOne-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, \n\n&#160;

These statements use such words as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;believe&#8221; and &#8220;plan.&#8221; They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. We have identified the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance elsewhere in this report, and investors are urged to consider these risks and uncertainties when evaluating our historical and expected performance. \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 230, "Negative": 92, "Polarity": 0.42857142724046143, "Subjectivity": 0.04611859065509616}, "similarity_score": 0.9100036886069885, "nlp_result": 0.14594023464399092}
