Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites, which we refer to as our &#8220;Direct to Consumer&#8221; operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and service businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, &#8220;must have&#8221; products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. \n\nIn addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nExpanding gross margin by: \n\n##TABLE_END - &#32;Making our supply chain a competitive advantage; \n\n- &#32;Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; and \n\n- Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price-to-value proposition. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nImproving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nImproving working capital efficiency; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeploying capital effectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigh single-digit revenue growth, \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMid-teens earnings per share growth, \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncreased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nConsistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. \n\n##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and earnings per share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 9% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 18% to 24% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 260 basis points. \n\nOn November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. \n\nOur fiscal 2013 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings, and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2013. Our revenues grew 8% to $25.3 billion, net income from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.69, an 11% increase from fiscal 2012. \n\nEarnings before interest and income taxes for continuing operations increased 8% for fiscal 2013, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across most NIKE &#160; Brand geographies, key categories and product types. This growth was primarily fueled by: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInnovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Lunar, Shox, FREE, Flywire, Dri-F.I.T, FlyKnit, NIKE +, and NIKE Fuel; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high profile athletes and teams (such as the NFL, FC Barcelona, Michael Jordan), high impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the Olympics, European Football Championships and NBA Finals) and digital marketing; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStrong category retail presentation online and at NIKE owned and retail partner stores. \n\n##TABLE_END Revenues also improved for each of our Other Businesses (Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley). \n\nOur gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs, primarily labor cost inflation, and foreign currency headwinds. \n\nFor fiscal 2013, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate. In addition, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, as a result of share repurchases during fiscal 2013. \n\nOn May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which would allow us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of $107 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of $231 million, net of tax. As of May 31, 2013 the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) \n\nOthers include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues from our NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2013, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Every NIKE Brand geography except Greater China delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013. North America contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Emerging Markets contributed 2 percentage points and Western and Central and Eastern Europe each contributed 1 percentage point. Greater China ' s results reduced NIKE, Inc. revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues for our Other Businesses contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth. \n\nExcluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 20% during fiscal 2013. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including Running models with NIKE FREE and Lunar technologies, NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles, and performance Football (soccer) products. In fiscal 2013, unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4%, driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. \n\nFor NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men ' s Training category (which includes the NFL licensed business), in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products, such as performance Running, Basketball, and NFL licensed apparel, and to a lesser extent, higher selling prices . \n\nWhile wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand Direct to Consumer revenues. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2013, Direct to Consumer revenues represented approximately 19% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 17% in fiscal 2012. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 24% for fiscal 2013, as comparable store sales grew 14% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. \n\nRevenues for our Other Businesses are comprised of results from Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased 9% in fiscal 2013, reflecting growth across all businesses. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations grew 15% for fiscal 2012, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15%, as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012. North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase, while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 12% during fiscal 2012, contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth. \n\nExcluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15% and 13%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16% during fiscal 2012. Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to double-digit percentage growth in unit sales along with a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, notably Running, Sportswear and Basketball. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by mid-single-digit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases, partially offset by a higher mix of close-out sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2011. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21% for fiscal 2012, as comparable store sales grew 13% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. \n\nRevenues for our Other Businesses consisted of results from our affiliate brands; Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 12% in fiscal 2012, reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley, which was down slightly for the fiscal year. \n\nFutures Orders \n\nFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013 were 8% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. &#160; Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. &#160; Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders also increased 8%, as unit orders contributed approximately 5 percentage points of growth and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth. \n\nBy geography, futures orders growth was as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReported Futures \n\nOrders Growth \n\n&#160; \n\nFutures Orders \n\nExcluding Currency Changes (1) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGreater China \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nJapan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal NIKE Brand Futures Orders \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nGrowth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Margin \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Profit \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,034 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,148 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,202 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nGross Margin % \n\n&#160; \n\n43.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n43.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n&#160; \n\n45.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(220) bps \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2013, our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher net average selling prices (approximately 160 basis points) that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix. The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs (approximately 110 basis points), primarily due to higher factory labor costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (approximately 40 basis points). \n\nIn addition, we have seen significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits, it has a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2012, our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, across most businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges, discounts on close-out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points. Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases, lower air freight costs, the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling and Administrative Expense \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nDemand creation expense (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,607 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,344 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating overhead expense \n\n&#160; \n\n5,035 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,458 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4,017 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling and administrative expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,780 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,065 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,361 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% of Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n30.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n30.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n&#160; \n\n31.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(130) bps \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nDemand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nDemand creation expense increased 5% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, demand creation expense increased 8%. \n\nCompared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 13%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs, and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business.

For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point. \n\nCompared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 11%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business.

This change was primarily driven by a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses in the current year as well as the recognition of a $24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand ' s Western Europe operations in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from non-operating items. \n\nWe estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of $56 million for fiscal 2013. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2012, other expense, net increased $79 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $77 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year. These impacts, together with a $24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brand ' s Western Europe operations, were partially offset by certain net gains related to non-operating items. \n\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense, net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n24.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n25.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(30) bps \n\n&#160; \n\n24.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nbps \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nThe 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the U.S. legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nThe Company continually evaluates its existing portfolio of businesses to ensure resources are invested in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand and represent the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, the Company announced its intention to divest of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. \n\nOn February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of $570 million and received at closing $561 million, net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million, net of $137 million in tax expense; this gain is included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. \n\nBeginning November 30, 2012, we classified the Cole Haan disposal group as held-for-sale and presented the results of Cole Haan&#8217;s operations in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. From this date until the sale, the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. Previously, these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as &#8220;Other Businesses.&#8221; \n\nUnder the sale agreement, we agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. We will also license NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period. The continuing cash flows related to these items are not expected to be significant to Cole Haan and we will have no significant continuing involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services. Additionally, preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remain in place after the sale; the maximum exposure under the guarantees is $44 million at May 31, 2013. The fair value of these guarantees is not material. \n\nOn November 30, 2012, we completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (&#8220;Iconix&#8221;) for $225 million. The results of Umbro&#8217;s operations and Umbro&#8217;s financial position are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and balance sheets, respectively. Previously, these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as &#8220;Other Businesses.&#8221; Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, we recorded a loss of $107 million, net of tax, on the sale of Umbro. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less the Umbro assets of $248 million, including intangibles, goodwill, and fixed assets, other miscellaneous charges of $22 million, and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of $129 million, offset by a $67 million tax benefit on the loss. \n\nUnder the sale agreement, we provided transition services to Iconix while certain markets were transitioned to Iconix-designated licensees. These transition services are substantially complete and we have wound down the remaining operations of Umbro. \n\nFor the year ended May 31, 2013 , net income (loss) from discontinued operations included, for both businesses, the net gain or loss on sale, net operating losses, tax expenses, and approximately $ 20 million &#32;in wind down costs. \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Segments \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central &#38; Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. \n\nAs part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity&#8217;s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. \n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2013 presentation. \n\nThe breakdown of revenues is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes (2) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,387 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,839 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,579 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n4,128 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,868 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n1,287 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,200 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,040 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGreater China \n\n&#160; \n\n2,453 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,539 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,060 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nJapan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n3,718 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,737 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal NIKE Brand Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n22,881 \n\n&#160; \n\n21,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n18,153 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOther Businesses \n\n&#160; \n\n2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,041 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nCorporate (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n(68 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(46 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(77 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories drove the revenue growth in fiscal 2013. North America ' s Direct to Consumer revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales as well as the addition of new stores and rapid growth in online sales. \n\nNorth America footwear revenue growth was driven by higher demand in all seven key categories, most notably Basketball, Running, and Sportswear. Both unit sales and average selling price per pair increased 7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven approximately equally by price increases and a favorable mix of higher priced products. \n\nApparel revenue growth in North America was driven by higher demand in our Men ' s Training category, reflecting the addition of the NFL licensed business, as well as Basketball, Women ' s Training, and Running. Unit sales increased 10% while average selling price per unit increased 12%, largely driven by a favorable mix of higher priced products. \n\nNorth America EBIT increased faster than revenue due to gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2013, reflecting the favorable impact of selling price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, an unfavorable mix of lower margin products and royalties for the NFL business. Selling and administrative expenses increased versus fiscal 2012, though at a rate slower than revenue; the growth was largely driven by higher demand creation expense for the Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as well as key product initiatives, including the NFL launch, and higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nRevenues for North America increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth in both wholesale and Direct to Consumer revenues. Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers, driving demand for NIKE Brand products across all seven key categories. North America&#8217;s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19% for fiscal 2012, driven by 15% growth in comparable store sales. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, footwear revenue in North America increased 15%, driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices. Unit sales rose at a double-digit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a mid-single-digit rate, reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Basketball, Women&#8217;s Training and Sportswear. \n\nCompared to the prior year, apparel revenue for North America increased 18%, primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in unit sales. The increase in average selling price per unit was reflective of product price increases and a greater mix of higher price point products. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, including Men&#8217;s Training, Running and Basketball. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, EBIT for North America increased 17% as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on close-out sales, which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases, lower air freight costs and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012, as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues. \n\nWestern Europe \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,646 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,526 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,345 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n1,261 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,377 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,303 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,128 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,868 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales to Wholesale Customers \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,416 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,556 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,385 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSales Direct to Consumer \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,128 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,868 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, most territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2013, which more than offset revenue declines of 17% and 18% in Italy and Iberia, respectively, reflecting poor economic conditions in Southern Europe. Revenues for the U.K. &#160; &#38; Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland) territories, the largest markets in Western Europe, increased 8% and 12%, respectively. The growth in Direct to Consumer revenues reflected 17% growth in comparable store sales, the addition of 19 net new factory stores and strong growth in online sales. On a category basis, Western Europe ' s revenue growth was largely driven by growth in our Running and Basketball categories. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenue growth in Western Europe was primarily driven by growth in Running, Sportswear, and Basketball. Unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 3%, the latter primarily the result of price increases. \n\nThe constant currency decrease in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to a decline in Sportswear, partially offset by growth in Running, Men ' s Training, and Basketball. Unit sales in fiscal 2013 decreased 1% while average selling price per unit decreased 3%, as higher discounts on close-out sales more than offset selling price increases. \n\nThe EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates; higher net average selling prices were mostly offset by higher product costs. The increase in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as higher sports marketing expense. Additionally, operating overhead costs increased to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2013 EBIT growth for Western Europe was also increased by a $24 million, one-time restructuring charge that was recorded in other (income) expense, net, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 4% for fiscal 2012, as most territories reported revenue growth, which more than offset revenue declines in the U.K. &#38; Ireland and Italy. Revenues for the U.K. &#38; Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, declined 3% for the fiscal 2012 period. Western Europe&#8217;s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 18% for fiscal 2012, including 8% growth in comparable store sales. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 5% for fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a low-single-digit percentage growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair, primarily reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer), which more than offset a decline in Action Sports. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2% for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a mid-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, reflective of higher product prices. Partially offsetting the increase in average selling price per unit was a mid-single-digit percentage decline in unit sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a decline in Sportswear. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 7% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 18%, primarily driven by a 350 basis point decline in gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The decline in gross margin was driven by higher product input costs and the negative impact from changes in standard currency rates, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Also reflected in Western Europe&#8217;s fiscal 2012 results was a $24 million charge relating to the restructuring of its operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,287 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,200 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,040 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nOn a currency neutral basis, Central &#160; &#38; Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2013 were driven by growth across most territories, particularly Russia and Turkey, which grew 28% and 19%, respectively. Revenue growth in Central &#38; Eastern Europe was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by growth in Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 6% while average selling price per pair increased 5%, primarily driven by price increases. \n\nConstant currency apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in nearly all categories, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Running. Unit sales increased 16%, while average selling price per unit decreased 2%, as an unfavorable mix of lower priced products more than off-set higher selling prices. \n\nEBIT for Central &#160; &#38; Eastern Europe grew faster than revenue primarily due to gross margin improvement and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points, largely driven by price increases and the favorable impact of our higher margin Direct to Consumer business, more than offsetting higher product costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nExcluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Central &#38; Eastern Europe increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth across most territories, including double-digit growth in Russia and Turkey, which more than offset lower revenues in Greece. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central &#38; Eastern Europe&#8217;s footwear revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair. The increase in average selling price per pair was reflective of product price increases which more than offset the negative impact of higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and Football (Soccer). \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central &#38; Eastern Europe&#8217;s apparel revenues grew 24%, mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales, offset by a slight decrease in average price per unit, mainly due to less favorable product mix and higher discounts on in-line sales, which more than offset the impact from product price increases. The overall increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in Football (Soccer), Sportswear and Running. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for Central &#38; Eastern Europe increased 15% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 4%, primarily driven by a 420 basis point decline in gross margin. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher product input costs as well as higher discounts on in-line and close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact from product price increases.

These downsides were partially offset by 33% growth in our Direct to Consumer business driven by comparable store sales growth of 13% and the addition of 29 net new factory stores. Fiscal 2013 revenues for most key categories were lower than in fiscal 2012. \n\nFor fiscal 2013, constant currency footwear revenue growth for Greater China declined, driven by lower sales across most key categories, most notably Sportswear and Men ' s and Women ' s Training, and increased reserves for product discounts and returns. Unit sales decreased 1%, while average selling price per pair decreased 2%, reflecting a higher mix of close-out sales and higher discounts. \n\nThe decrease in constant currency apparel revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by lower revenues in Sportswear and Men ' s and Women ' s Training, partially offset by higher revenues in Basketball. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 were 3% lower than the prior year while average selling price per unit was down 6%, reflecting a higher mix of close-out sales and higher discounts. \n\nFiscal 2013 EBIT for Greater China decreased at a faster rate than revenue, driven by lower gross margin and selling and administrative expense deleverage. Fiscal 2013 gross margin decreased 50 basis points due to a lower average selling price per unit driven by higher discounts and close-out mix partially offset by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues, driven primarily by the increased investment in our Direct to Consumer business and the decrease in revenues. \n\nOur results in Greater China have been adversely impacted by sluggish macroeconomic growth and slow product sell-through at retail, leading to high levels of inventory in the marketplace. Our strategy to return to sustained, profitable growth in Greater China focuses on extending our brand leadership position with consumers; expanding the offering of product styles and fits designed for the Chinese consumer; and working with our retail partners to create more differentiated, productive, and profitable retail stores. \n\nDespite the challenges we have seen in China, there are indications that our strategies are taking hold in the marketplace. Comparable store sales are growing in our NIKE-owned Direct to Consumer doors and our wholesale customers are reporting comparable store growth and declining inventory levels. While we are making progress, we will continue to work with our retailers to optimize inventory, accelerate sell-through, and improve retail productivity. While China futures orders for the next six months are in line with last year, we expect revenues for the first half of the fiscal year will be below last year as we continue to manage the amount of product we ship into the market. We believe our revenue in China will stabilize around prior year levels in the second half of this fiscal year. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2012, driven by continued expansion in the number of both NIKE mono-branded stores owned by our wholesale customers and NIKE owned stores, as well as higher comparable store sales. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China&#8217;s footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a mid-single-digit growth in average unit price per pair, reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China&#8217;s apparel revenues for fiscal 2012 was mainly driven by a high-single-digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for Greater China increased 23% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 17%, as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Gross margin decreased 150 basis points for fiscal 2012, primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, driven by an increase in operating overhead expense. \n\nJapan \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, the revenue increase for Japan was driven by higher revenues in Running, Football (Soccer) and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear and Men ' s and Women ' s Training. \n\nFiscal 2013 EBIT for Japan decreased as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by gross margin improvement and lower selling and administrative expense.

On a currency neutral basis, footwear revenue in Japan increased 3% for fiscal 2012, as growth in Running and Football (Soccer) more than offset a decline in Sportswear. \n\nExcluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue decreased 1% for fiscal 2012, as the decline in Sportswear more than offset the growth in Running and Football (Soccer). \n\nOn a reported basis, EBIT for Japan grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of improved gross margin and leverage of selling and administrative expenses. The increase in Japan&#8217;s gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the year-over-year change in standard currency rates, a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of close-out sales. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,570 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,387 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,897 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,718 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,737 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST \n\nAND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,011 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2013, constant currency revenue growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in every key category and every territory, led by Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. \n\nConstant currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in most key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Women ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 9% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by selling price increases. \n\nFiscal 2013 constant currency apparel revenue was driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, Sportswear, and Men ' s Training. Unit sales increased approximately 10% and average selling price per unit increased 9%, largely attributable to price increases. \n\nFiscal 2013 Emerging Markets EBIT grew faster than revenue primarily driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. Gross margin increased 260 basis points due largely to the favorable impact of price increases, the anniversary of a one-time custom duty charge in fiscal 2012, and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher product costs. As a percent of revenue, selling and administrative expense was higher due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nExcluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the Emerging Markets increased 26% for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the Emerging Markets was driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and mid-single-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit, primarily reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in Emerging Markets&#8217; footwear and apparel sales was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. \n\nThe increase in Emerging Markets&#8217; EBIT for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset a lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher product input costs, customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points, as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues. \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,396 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,200 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(971 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation, operating overhead, and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE Golf increased 9% for fiscal 2012, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our apparel business, partially offset by a single-digit percentage decline in our club business. \n\nOn a reported basis, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 13% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 9%, as earnings growth at Converse was partially off-set by losses at Hurley.

All other foreign currency related results, including conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency derivative instruments, are included in other (income) expense, net. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2013, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $260 million primarily due to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA $165 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of consolidated other (income) expense, net. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA $143 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business and performance-based compensation . &#32; \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2012, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes grew $112 million, mainly due to an increase of $49 million in performance-based compensation and a year-over-year net increase of $73 million from foreign currency impacts. These foreign currency impacts were driven by a year-over-year increase in foreign currency net losses, arising from certain Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign currency hedges and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. &#160; Dollar year-over-year. The above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses. \n\n##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. \n\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes \n\non the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nTransactional exposures \n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProduct Costs &#8212; NIKE&#8217;s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. \n\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. \n\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. \n\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. \n\n##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. \n\n##TABLE_START 2. \n\nFactory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories&#8217; foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (&#8220;factory currency exposure index&#8221;) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (&#8220;factory input costs&#8221;) are denominated. \n\n##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 17 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. \n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE&#8217;s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales &#8212; A portion of our Western Europe and Central &#38; Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther Costs &#8212; Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities &#8212; Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net &#32;within our consolidated results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_END Managing transactional exposures \n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.. \n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other (income) expense, net &#32;and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#8212; Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 &#8211; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. \n\nTranslational exposures \n\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries&#8217; non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders&#8217; equity. In the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $(605) million and $268 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate \n\nfluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $(104) million and $74 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. \n\nManaging translational exposures \n\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#8212; Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end. \n\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net &#32;had an unfavorable impact of approximately $56 million on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2013 and had an insignificant impact for the year ended May 31, 2012. \n\nNet investments in foreign subsidiaries \n\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net . The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2013 and 2012. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $22 million for the year ended May 31, 2012. \n\n##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCash Flow Activity \n\nCash provided by operations was $3.0 billion &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to $1.9 billion &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 &#32;was net income of $2.5 billion . Our fiscal 2013 change in working capital was a net cash outflow &#32;of $42 million , which is exclusive of working capital amounts sold as part of the divestitures of Umbro and Cole Haan, as compared to a net cash outflow &#32;of $799 million &#32;for fiscal 2012 . Our investments in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reductions in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2013 , inventory for continuing operations increased 7% compared to a 23% increase for fiscal 2012 ; the slowing growth was driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity. The reduction in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operations. \n\nCash used by investing activities was $1,067 million &#32;during fiscal 2013 , compared to a $514 million &#32;source of cash for fiscal 2012 . A major driver of the change was the swing from net sales/maturities of short-term investments in fiscal 2012 to net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2013, reflective of the additional purchases of short-term investments made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in April 2013. In fiscal 2012, there were $1,124 million &#32;of net sales/maturities of short-term investments (net of purchases), while in fiscal 2013 we made $1,203 million in net purchases of short-term investments (net of sales/maturities). This impact was partially offset by $786 million &#32;in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan in fiscal 2013. \n\nCash used by financing activities was $1,040 million &#32;for fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to $2,118 million &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to $986 million &#32;in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in April 2013. Also contributing to the decrease were lower payments of long-term debt and notes payable and lower repurchases of common stock, which were partially offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. \n\nIn fiscal 2013 , we purchased 33.5 million &#32;shares of NIKE&#8217;s class B common stock for $1.7 billion , an average price of $49.50. During the year, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million &#32;shares at an average price of $42.08 . Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2013 , we had repurchased 15.3 million &#32;shares at a cost of $789 million &#32;under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nOn April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2017. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. We will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not \n\nlimited to, discharging or refinancing debt, working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, as yet unplanned acquisitions of assets or businesses and investments in subsidiaries. \n\nOn November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures November 1, 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2013 , we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility. \n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2013 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. \n\nLiquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2013 , we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $505 million . As of May 31, 2013 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2014 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. \n\nAs of May 31, 2013 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $6.0 billion , of which $3.5 billion &#32;was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2013 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio is 98 days. \n\nDespite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. \n\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the U.S. through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt, we would incur additional interest expense . \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2013 &#32;and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Description of Commitment \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, \n\n(In millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nOperating Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,360 \n\nCapital Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,525 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,949 \n\nEndorsement Contracts (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,603 \n\nProduct Purchase Obligations (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n3,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,273 \n\nOther (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTOTAL \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,010 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,293 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,815 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nThe amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number \n\nof sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. \n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nWe generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2013 . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nOther amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2013 . \n\n##TABLE_END The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $447 million , excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2013 . We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. \n\nWe also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2013 . Refer to Note 7 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) \n\nOutstanding as of May 31, 2013 \n\nNotes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand \n\n$ \n\nPayable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAs of May 31, 2013 , letters of credit of $149 million &#32;were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company&#8217;s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. \n\n##TABLE_START Recently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2013, and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders&#8217; equity. Companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This requirement was effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Further, this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This requirement will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Recently Issued Accounting Standards \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity&#8217;s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \n\nWe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the \n\nsix-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. \n\nWithin the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. \n\nIn some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. \n\nIn certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. \n\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. \n\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable \n\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. \n\nInventory Reserves \n\nWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. &#160; \n\nContingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts \n\nA significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. \n\nSome of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. \n\nSome of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser&#8217;s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. \n\nSome of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset&#8217;s net book value to its salvage value. \n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant \n\nadverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group&#8217;s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets &#32; \n\nWe perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any. \n\nWe generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. \n\nIn the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \n\nA majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. \n\nHedge Accounting for Derivatives \n\nWe use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. \n\nWe have used and may, in the future, use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net \n\ninvestments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur. \n\nStock-based Compensation \n\nWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. \n\nTaxes \n\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. \n\nIn addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. \n\nWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. \n\nOn an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. \n\nOn a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 178, "Negative": 274, "Polarity": -0.21238938006108543, "Subjectivity": 0.04939890709842635}, "similarity_score": 0.9127097065427274, "nlp_result": 0.14624824956990778}
