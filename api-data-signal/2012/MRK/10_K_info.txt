Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Description of Merck&#146;s Business \n\nMerck &#38; Co., Inc. (&#147;Merck&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health, and consumer care products, which it markets directly and through its joint ventures. The Company&#146;s operations are principally managed on a products basis and are comprised of four operating segments, which are the Pharmaceutical, Animal Health, Consumer Care and Alliances segments, and one reportable segment, which is the Pharmaceutical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products marketed either directly by the Company or through joint ventures. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, primarily administered at physician offices. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company also has animal health operations that discover, develop, manufacture and market animal health products, including vaccines, which the Company sells to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers. Additionally, the Company has consumer care operations that develop, manufacture and market over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products, which are sold through wholesale and retail drug, food chain and mass merchandiser outlets, as well as club stores and specialty channels. \n\nOverview \n\nMerck continued to execute on its strategic priorities during 2012 despite facing several business challenges, including the August U.S. patent expiration for Singulair , a medicine indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Worldwide sales were $47.3 billion in 2012, a decline of 2% compared with 2011, including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 1% reflecting growth of key products and within key geographic regions which offset the impact of the U.S. Singulair patent expiration. The Company also reduced operating expenses by efficiently managing costs through targeted reductions. In addition, the Company generated new clinical data and advanced certain key research and development pipeline programs. \n\nThe Company&#146;s four-part growth strategy is focused on; one, executing on its core business, which includes its largest markets, its core brands, new launch brands, and research and development efforts targeted at therapeutic areas with the greatest future patient demand and scientific opportunity; two, expanding geographically into high-growth markets; three, extending into complementary businesses of consumer care and animal health; and four, effectively managing costs while continuing to invest for future growth. \n\nBeginning with the Company&#146;s sales performance in its largest markets during 2012, despite the adverse effects of the U.S. Singulair patent expiry which caused a significant and rapid decline in U.S. Singulair sales, sales in the United States were relatively flat compared to the prior year reflecting strong growth of key brands including Januvia and Janumet , treatments for type 2 diabetes, Zostavax , a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster), Gardasil , a vaccine to help prevent certain diseases caused by four types of human papillomavirus (&#147;HPV&#148;), Victrelis , a treatment for chronic hepatitis C, and Isentress , an antiretroviral therapy for use in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Turning to Europe and Canada, the Company continues to experience positive volume growth trends for many of its key brands, including Victrelis, Januvia , Janumet , and Simponi , a treatment for inflammatory diseases; however, this growth only partially offset increased generic erosion and the price declines stemming from the economic issues and related fiscal austerity measures in this region. \n\nWith respect to research and development efforts, the Company continued the advancement of drug candidates through its pipeline in 2012. The Company currently has three candidates under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#147;FDA&#148;): MK-4305, suvorexant, an investigational treatment for insomnia; MK-8616, sugammadex sodium injection, a medication for the reversal of certain muscle relaxants used during surgery; and MK-0653C, an investigational combination of ezetimibe and atorvastatin for the treatment of primary or mixed hyperlipidemia. MK-8109, vintafolide, an investigational cancer candidate, is under review in the European Union \n\n&#160; \n\n(the &#147;EU&#148;). In addition, the Company currently has 16 candidates in Phase III development and anticipates filing a New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;) or a Biologics License Application (&#147;BLA&#148;), as applicable, with the FDA with respect to several of these candidates in 2013. \n\nIn December 2012, the Company announced the HPS2-THRIVE (Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) study of Tredaptive (extended-release niacin/laropiprant) did not meet its primary endpoint. As a result, the Company does not plan to seek regulatory approval for the medicine in the United States. In January 2013, Merck began taking steps to suspend the availability of Tredaptive outside the United States. Also, on February 1, 2013, the Company announced that it had recently received and was reviewing safety and efficacy data from a Phase III study involving MK-0822, odanacatib, the Company&#146;s investigational treatment for osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. As a result of its review of this data, the Company concluded that review of additional data from the previously planned, ongoing extension study was warranted and that filing an application for approval with the FDA should be delayed. As previously announced, the Company is conducting a blinded extension of the trial in approximately 8,200 women, which will provide additional safety and efficacy data. Merck now anticipates that it will file applications for approval of odanacatib in 2014 with additional data from the extension trial. The Company continues to believe that odanacatib will have the potential to address unmet medical needs in patients with osteoporosis. \n\nMerck continues to pursue opportunities for establishing external alliances to complement its substantial internal research capabilities, including research collaborations, as well as licensing preclinical and clinical compounds and technology platforms that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. During 2012, the Company completed a variety of transactions spanning different therapeutic areas and clinical stages including licensing agreements with Endocyte, Inc. (&#147;Endocyte&#148;) for vintafolide (MK-8109), an investigational cancer candidate, and with AiCuris for a portfolio of investigational medicines targeting human cytomegalovirus, including letermovir (MK-8228). \n\nConsistent with the second element of the Company&#146;s strategy to expand geographically in high-growth markets such as Japan and key emerging markets, the Company continued to invest in these markets in 2012. Emerging market sales grew 4% in 2012, including a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, despite the loss of sales from Remicade and Simponi , treatments for inflammatory diseases, in markets relinquished to Johnson &#38; Johnson (&#147;J&#38;J&#148;) as part of the arbitration settlement agreement in 2011 as discussed below. China continues to be an important growth driver with sales exceeding $1.0 billion in 2012, representing growth of 25% over the prior year, including a 3% favorable effect from foreign exchange. Growth in Japan was 6% during 2012, tempered by generic competition and the biennial price cuts early in the year. Merck has entered into several transactions designed to strengthen its presence in the emerging markets in the longer term. The Company&#146;s joint venture with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group in China began preliminary operations in late-2012. \n\nThe third component of Merck&#146;s strategy relates to the complementary businesses of Consumer Care and Animal Health. Merck&#146;s Animal Health business continues as a solid contributor with 4% revenue growth in 2012, including a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting growth in the cattle, poultry, companion animal and swine product lines. Sales of Consumer Care products grew 6% in 2012, including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, led by the Dr. Scholl&#146;s franchise and higher sales of Coppertone , MiraLAX and Claritin . \n\nAs noted, the last element of the Company&#146;s strategy is to tightly manage costs while also investing for growth. Consistent with these efforts, Merck remains committed to driving continuous productivity improvements across the enterprise and continues to realize cost savings across all areas of the Company. These savings result from various actions, including the Merger Restructuring Program discussed below, previously announced ongoing cost reduction activities, as well as from non-restructuring-related activities. As of the end of 2012, the Company had achieved its projected $3.5 billion in annual net cost savings from these activities since the merger with Schering-Plough Corporation (&#147;Schering-Plough&#148;) (the &#147;Merger&#148;). \n\nThe global restructuring program that was initiated in conjunction with the integration of the legacy Merck and legacy Schering-Plough businesses (the &#147;Merger Restructuring Program&#148;) is intended to optimize the cost structure of the combined company. The workforce reductions associated with this plan relate to the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as from the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and research and development sites and the consolidation of office facilities. The Company recorded total pretax restructuring costs of $951 million in 2012, $1.8 billion in 2011 and $1.8 billion in \n\n&#160; \n\n2010 related to this program. Costs associated with the Company&#146;s restructuring actions are included in Materials and production costs, Marketing and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses and Restructuring costs . The restructuring actions under the Merger Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013, with the exception of certain actions, principally manufacturing-related. Subsequent to the Merger, the Company has rationalized a number of manufacturing sites worldwide. The remaining actions under this program will result in additional manufacturing facility rationalizations, which are expected to be substantially completed by 2016. The Company now expects the estimated total cumulative pretax costs for this program to be approximately $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion. The Company estimates that approximately two-thirds of the cumulative pretax costs relate to cash outlays, primarily related to employee separation expense. Approximately one-third of the cumulative pretax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The Company expects the Merger Restructuring Program to yield annual savings by the end of 2013 of approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion and annual savings upon completion of the program of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.6 billion. \n\nIn November 2012, Merck&#146;s Board of Directors raised the Company&#146;s quarterly dividend to $0.43 per share from $0.42 per share. \n\nIn February 2013, Merck reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs to resolve two federal securities class-action lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Merck, Schering-Plough and certain of their current and former officers and directors (the &#147;ENHANCE Litigation&#148;). Under the proposed agreement, Merck will pay $215 million to resolve the securities class action against all of the Merck defendants and $473 million to resolve the securities class action against all of the Schering-Plough defendants. In connection with the settlement, Merck recorded a pretax and after-tax charge of $493 million in 2012 which reflects $195 million of anticipated insurance recoveries. \n\nEarnings per common share assuming dilution attributable to common shareholders (&#147;EPS&#148;) for 2012 were $2.00, which reflect a net unfavorable impact resulting from acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs, as well as the charge related to the ENHANCE Litigation noted above. Non-GAAP EPS in 2012 were $3.82 excluding these items (see &#147;Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS&#148; below). \n\nCompetition and the Health Care Environment \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company&#146;s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug and consumer health care manufacturers. The Company&#146;s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors&#146; branded products, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as the Company&#146;s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to certain products. Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. \n\nPharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. Additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as joint ventures and licenses, and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth for the Company&#146;s products in that therapeutic category. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company&#146;s products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors. \n\nThe Company&#146;s consumer care operations face competition from other consumer health care businesses as well as retailers who carry their own private label brands. The Company&#146;s competitive position is affected by several factors, including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, the quality and price of the Company&#146;s products, promotional efforts and the growth of lower cost private label brands. \n\nHealth Care Environment \n\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In the United States, federal and state governments for many years also have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010, which began to be implemented in 2010. Various insurance market reforms have advanced and will continue through full implementation in 2014. The law is expected to expand access to health care to about 32 million Americans by the end of the decade who did not previously have insurance coverage. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the mandated Medicaid rebate increased from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to Medicare Part D beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called &#147;donut hole&#148;). Approximately $210 million and $150 million was recorded by Merck as a reduction to revenue in 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee was $2.8 billion in 2012 and will be $2.8 billion in 2013. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Company recorded $190 million and $162 million of costs within Marketing and administrative expenses in 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. \n\nThe Company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company&#146;s sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i) practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. \n\nIn addition, in the effort to contain the U.S. federal deficit, the pharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls in the Medicare prescription drug program (Part D). In addition, Congress may again consider proposals to allow, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries. It remains very uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the Company. \n\nEfforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in several European countries. Many countries have announced austerity measures, which include the implementation of pricing actions to reduce prices of generic and patented drugs and mandatory switches to generic drugs. While the Company is taking steps to mitigate the impact in the EU, the austerity measures continued to negatively affect the Company&#146;s revenue performance in 2012 and the Company anticipates the austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2013. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditionally, the global economic downturn and the sovereign debt issues in certain European countries, among other factors, have adversely affected foreign receivables in certain European countries. While the Company continues to receive payment on these receivables, these conditions have resulted in an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding thereby adversely affecting cash flows. \n\nGovernments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and related measures that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in 2013 to varying degrees in the emerging markets. \n\nThe Company&#146;s focus on and share of revenue from emerging markets has increased. Countries in these markets may be subject to conditions that can affect the Company&#146;s efforts to continue to grow in emerging markets, including potential political instability, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company&#146;s risk exposure. \n\nThe full impact of health care reform, as well as continuing budget pressures on governments around the world, cannot be predicted at this time. \n\nIn addressing cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to attempt to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company seeks to work with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of government health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments in order to improve their citizens&#146; access to appropriate health care, including medicines. \n\nCertain markets outside of the United States have implemented health technology assessments and other cost management strategies which require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on reimbursement available and obtained. \n\nOperating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company&#146;s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world. Governmental regulation and legislation tend to focus on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement, especially related to the pricing of products. \n\nOf particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. \n\nThe EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU member states. The Company&#146;s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company&#146;s business. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. \n\nAccess to Medicines \n\nAs a global health care company, Merck&#146;s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its products around the world. The Company&#146;s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company&#146;s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. For example, the Company has been recognized for pricing many of its products through a differential pricing framework, taking into consideration such factors as a country&#146;s level of economic development and public health need. In addition, the Merck Patient Assistance Program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the United States who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company&#146;s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicine and vaccines. \n\nBuilding on the Company&#146;s own efforts, Merck has undertaken collaborations with many stakeholders to improve access to medicines and enhance the quality of life for people around the world. \n\nFor example, in 2011, Merck announced that it would launch &#147;Merck for Mothers,&#148; a long-term effort with global health partners to create a world where no woman has to die from preventable complications of pregnancy and childbirth. The launch includes a 10-year, $500 million initiative that applies Merck&#146;s scientific and business expertise to making proven solutions more widely available, developing new technologies and improving public awareness, policy efforts and private sector engagement to reduce maternal mortality. \n\nMerck has also in the past provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health. One of these partnerships is The African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership in Botswana, a collaboration with the government of Botswana that was renewed in 2010 and supports Botswana&#146;s response to HIV/AIDS through a comprehensive and sustainable approach to HIV prevention, care, treatment, and support. \n\nPrivacy and Data Protection \n\nThe Company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company&#146;s business, including recently enacted laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America and increased enforcement activity in the United States and other developed markets. \n\nOperating Results \n\nSales \n\nWorldwide sales totaled $47.3 billion in 2012, a decline of 2% compared with $48.0 billion in 2011. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3%. The sales decrease was driven primarily by Singulair , which lost market exclusivity in the United States in August 2012 resulting in a significant and rapid decline in U.S. Singulair sales. The sales decline was also driven by lower sales of Remicade , a treatment for inflammatory diseases, largely as a result of the arbitration settlement agreement with J&#38;J in 2011 as discussed below. In addition, lower sales of Cozaar and Hyzaar , treatments for hypertension, Clarinex , a non-sedating antihistamine, Fosamax , for the treatment of osteoporosis, Vytorin , a cholesterol modifying medicine, Primaxin , an anti-bacterial product, and Avelox , a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, as well as lower revenue from the Company&#146;s relationship with AstraZeneca LP (&#147;AZLP&#148;) also contributed to the sales decline in 2012. These declines were largely offset by higher sales of Januvia , Gardasil , Victrelis , Zostavax , Janumet , Isentress , Zetia , a cholesterol modifying medicine, Dulera , a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, as well as by higher sales of the Company&#146;s animal health and consumer care products. \n\nSales in the United States were $20.4 billion in 2012, a decline of 1% compared with $20.5 billion in 2011. The sales decrease was driven by lower sales of Singulair , Vytorin , Avelox , Cozaar and Hyzaar , as well as lower revenue from the Company&#146;s relationship with AZLP. These declines were largely offset by higher sales of \n\n&#160; \n\nJanuvia , Zostavax , Gardasil , Victrelis , Janumet , Isentress , Pneumovax , a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, Zetia and Dulera , as well as higher sales of animal health and consumer care products. \n\nInternational sales were $26.9 billion in 2012, a decline of 2% compared with $27.6 billion in 2011. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected international sales performance by 4% in 2012. Declines in Europe and Canada were partially offset by growth in Japan and certain of the emerging markets, particularly in China. Lower sales of Remicade led the decline, along with lower sales of Cozaar , Hyzaar , Singulair , Fosamax and Clarinex , partially offset by growth in Januvia , Victrelis , Gardasil and Janumet . International sales represented 57% of total sales in both 2012 and 2011. \n\nGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. In many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, other austerity measures negatively affected the Company&#146;s revenue performance in 2012. The Company anticipates these pricing actions and other austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2013. \n\nWorldwide sales totaled $48.0 billion in 2011, an increase of 4% compared with $46.0 billion in 2010. Foreign exchange favorably affected global sales performance by 2%. The revenue increase was driven largely by growth in Januvia and Janumet, Singulair , Isentress, Gardasil, Simponi, RotaTeq , a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, Zetia , Pneumovax and Bridion , for the reversal of certain muscle relaxants used during surgery. In addition, revenue in 2011 benefited from higher sales of the Company&#146;s animal health products and from the launch of Victrelis . These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cozaar , Hyzaar , Vytorin , Temodar , a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, ProQuad , a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, and Varivax , a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella). Revenue was also negatively affected by lower sales of Caelyx, Subutex and Suboxone as the Company no longer has marketing rights to these products. In addition, the ongoing implementation of certain provisions of U.S. health care reform legislation during 2011 resulted in further increases in Medicaid rebates and other impacts that reduced revenues as compared with 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales of the Company&#146;s products were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Primary Care and Women&#146;s Health \n\n&#160;

The sales increase reflects positive performance in the United States due to pricing, as well as volume growth in Japan, partially offset by volume declines in the United States. Sales of Zetia increased 6% in 2011 to $2.4 billion, including a 3% favorable effect from foreign exchange. The increase reflects higher sales in international markets, particularly in Japan, partially offset by volume declines in the United States. \n\nGlobal sales of Vytorin (marketed outside the United States as Inegy ), a combination product containing the active ingredients of both Zetia and Zocor , declined 7% in 2012 to $1.7 billion, including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales decline reflects volume declines in the United States, partially offset by pricing in the United States and volume growth in certain international markets. Worldwide sales of Vytorin declined 7% in 2011 to $1.9 billion reflecting volume declines in the United States, partially offset by increases in international markets. \n\nIn March 2012, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (the &#147;DSMB&#148;) of the IMPROVE-IT trial, a large cardiovascular outcomes study evaluating ezetimibe/simvastatin against simvastatin alone in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, completed the second pre-specified interim efficacy analysis of the study. The DSMB conducted the planned interim efficacy analysis after the trial had reached approximately 75% of the targeted 5,250 clinical endpoints called for in the study design. The DSMB recommended that the study continue without change in design and stated it planned to review the data again in approximately nine months. That review has been scheduled for March 2013, at which point nine months of additional data will have been adjudicated. Merck remains blinded to IMPROVE-IT safety and efficacy data. IMPROVE-IT is an 18,000 patient event-driven trial and, based on the current rate at which events are being reported, the Company now anticipates the targeted 5,250 clinical endpoints for study completion will be reached in 2014. \n\nIn December 2012, Merck announced the HPS2-THRIVE study of Tredaptive did not meet its primary endpoint (see &#147;Research and Development&#148; below). Subsequently, based on the understanding of the preliminary data from the HPS2-THRIVE study and in consultation with regulatory authorities, Merck began taking steps to suspend the availability of Tredaptive , which is approved for use in certain countries outside of the United States. The Company recognized approximately $40 million of costs in 2012 associated with suspending the availability of Tredaptive . Sales of Tredaptive were $17 million in 2012. \n\nDiabetes and Obesity \n\nGlobal sales of Januvia , Merck&#146;s dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (&#147;DPP-4&#148;) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, rose 23% in 2012 to $4.1 billion and grew 39% in 2011 to $3.3 billion reflecting volume growth in the United States, as well as in international markets, particularly in Japan. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 2% in 2012 and favorably affected sales performance by 3% in 2011. \n\nWorldwide sales of Janumet , Merck&#146;s oral antihyperglycemic agent that combines sitagliptin ( Januvia) with metformin in a single tablet to target all three key defects of type 2 diabetes, were $1.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 22% compared with 2011, reflecting volume growth in the United States, the emerging markets and Europe. Global sales of Janumet were $1.4 billion in 2011 compared with $954 million in 2010 reflecting growth internationally due in part to ongoing launches in certain markets, as well as growth in the United States. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 4% in 2012 and favorably affected sales performance by 2% in 2011. \n\nIn February 2012, the FDA approved Janumet XR , a new treatment for type 2 diabetes that combines sitagliptin with extended-release metformin. Janumet XR provides a convenient once-daily treatment option for health care providers and patients who need help to control their blood sugar. \n\nAs previously disclosed, on February 17, 2012, the FDA sent a Warning Letter to the Company relating to Januvia and Janumet stating that the Company did not fulfill a post-marketing requirement for a 3-month pancreatic safety study in a diabetic rodent model treated with sitagliptin. The Company completed the study and \n\n&#160; \n\nsubmitted the study report to the FDA in December 2012. The FDA has recently reviewed the submission and concluded that the post-marketing requirement has been fulfilled. \n\nRespiratory \n\nWorldwide sales of Singulair, a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, declined 30% to $3.9 billion in 2012 driven primarily by lower sales in the United States. Revenue declines in Europe, Canada and Latin America also contributed to the Singulair sales decline. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Singulair expired on August 3, 2012 and the Company experienced a significant and rapid decline in U.S. Singulair sales thereafter. U.S. sales of Singulair declined 97% in the fourth quarter to $25 million. U.S. sales of Singulair decreased 39% to $2.2 billion for the full year of 2012 driven by lower sales after the U.S. patent expiry in August. In addition, the patent that provided market exclusivity for Singulair expired in a number of major European markets in February 2013 and the Company expects a significant and rapid reduction in sales of Singulair in those markets. The patent that provides market exclusivity for Singulair in Japan will expire in 2016. In 2012, sales of Singulair were $602 million in Europe and $668 million in Japan. Global sales of Singulair grew 10% in 2011 to $5.5 billion, including a 2% favorable impact of foreign exchange, driven primarily by favorable pricing in the United States, as well as volume growth in Japan and in the emerging markets. \n\nGlobal sales of Nasonex , an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, declined 1% in 2012 to $1.3 billion, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales performance reflects price declines in Europe and lower volumes in the United States, largely offset by higher prices in the United States. In 2009, Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, &#147;Apotex&#148;) filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the FDA seeking approval to sell its generic version of Nasonex . In June 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled against the Company in a patent infringement suit against Apotex holding that Apotex&#146;s generic version of Nasonex does not infringe on the Company&#146;s formulation patent (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company has appealed the U.S. District Court decision. If generic versions become available, significant losses of Nasonex sales could occur and the Company may take a non-cash impairment charge with respect to the value of the Nasonex intangible asset, which had a carrying value of approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2012. If the Nasonex intangible asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment charge could be material. As a result of the unfavorable U.S. District Court decision, the Company evaluated the Nasonex intangible asset for impairment and concluded that it was not impaired. U.S. sales of Nasonex were $597 million in 2012. Worldwide sales of Nasonex increased 5% in 2011 to $1.3 billion, including a 1% favorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales increase was driven largely by volume growth in Japan and Latin America, partially offset by volume declines in the United States. \n\nGlobal sales of Clarinex (marketed as Aerius in many countries outside the United States), a non-sedating antihistamine, declined 37% in 2012 to $393 million driven by lower volumes in Europe and the United States as a result of generic competition. As previously disclosed, by virtue of litigation settlements, certain generic manufacturers were given the right to enter the U.S. market in 2012 and several generic versions have been launched. The Company anticipates that sales of Clarinex will continue to decline. Worldwide sales of Clarinex were $621 million in 2011 compared with $623 million in 2010. \n\nGlobal sales of Dulera Inhalation Aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, were $207 million in 2012 compared with $96 million in 2011 reflecting volume growth in the United States. Dulera Inhalation Aerosol was approved by the FDA in June 2010. In January 2012, Merck received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA on the Company&#146;s supplemental New Drug Application for Dulera , for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Company is planning to conduct an additional clinical study and update the application in the future. \n\nWomen&#146;s Health and Endocrine \n\nWorldwide sales of Fosamax and Fosamax Plus D (marketed as Fosavance throughout the EU and as Fosamac in Japan) for the treatment and, in the case of Fosamax , prevention of osteoporosis, declined 21% in 2012 to $676 million and decreased 8% in 2011 to $855 million. These medicines have lost market exclusivity in the United States and in most major European markets. During 2012, declines in Japan and the emerging markets also contributed to the sales decrease. The Company expects the declines within the Fosamax product franchise to continue. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide sales of NuvaRing , a vaginal contraceptive product, were $623 million in 2012, comparable with sales in 2011. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 3% in 2012. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales performance in 2012 reflects volume growth in the emerging markets and positive performance in Europe. Global sales of NuvaRing grew 12% to $623 million in 2011, including a 3% beneficial effect from foreign exchange, driven by positive performance in the United States and internationally. \n\nGlobal sales of Follistim AQ (marketed in most countries outside the United States as Puregon ), a biological fertility treatment, declined 12% in 2012 to $468 million, including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, driven largely by declines in Europe resulting from supply issues and pricing. Sales of Follistim AQ were $530 million in 2011 compared with $528 million in 2010 reflecting growth in emerging markets offset by declines in Europe due primarily to supply constraints. Puregon lost market exclusivity in the EU in August 2009. \n\nThe Company is currently experiencing difficulty manufacturing certain women&#146;s health products. The Company is working to resolve these issues, which were not material to the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nOther \n\nGlobal sales of Maxalt , a product for the acute treatment of migraine, were $638 million in 2012, comparable with sales in 2011. Sales performance in 2012 reflects higher sales in the United States driven by favorable pricing, offset by volume declines in Europe and Canada due to generic erosion. Sales of Maxalt increased 16% in 2011 to $639 million reflecting a higher inventory level and favorable pricing in the United States. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Maxalt expired in December 2012 and the Company is experiencing a decline in U.S. Maxalt sales and expects the decline to continue. In addition, the patent that provides market exclusivity for Maxalt will expire in a number of major European markets in August 2013 and the Company anticipates that sales in those European markets will decline significantly after these patent expiries. In 2012, sales of Maxalt were $491 million in the United States and $92 million in Europe. \n\nSales of Avelox , a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections marketed by the Company in the United States, declined 37% in 2012 to $201 million due primarily to a competitor&#146;s product becoming available in generic form. Sales of Avelox grew 2% in 2011 to $322 million. The patent that provides U.S. market exclusivity for Avelox expires in March 2014; however, by agreement, a generic manufacturer may launch a generic version of Avelox in February 2014. \n\nOther products included in Primary Care and Women&#146;s Health include among others, Asmanex Twisthaler , an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma; Implanon , a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant; Cerazette , a progestin only oral contraceptive; and Arcoxia , for the treatment of arthritis and pain. \n\nHospital and Specialty \n\nImmunology \n\nSales of Remicade , a treatment for inflammatory diseases, were $2.1 billion in 2012, a decline of 22% compared with 2011, and were $2.7 billion in 2011, a decline of 2% compared with 2010. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 6% in 2012 and favorably affected sales performance by 5% in 2011. Prior to July 1, 2011, Remicade was marketed by the Company outside of the United States (except in Japan and certain other Asian markets). As a result of the agreement reached in April 2011 to amend the agreement governing the distribution rights to Remicade and Simponi , effective July 1, 2011, Merck relinquished marketing rights for these products in certain territories including Canada, Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Merck retained exclusive marketing rights throughout Europe, Russia and Turkey (the &#147;Retained Territories&#148;). In the Retained Territories, Remicade sales declined 2% in 2012, which reflects an 8% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and volume growth in Europe. Sales of Remicade in the Retained Territories grew 13% in 2011, which reflects a 6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Simponi , a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases was approved by the European Commission (the &#147;EC&#148;) in October 2009. Sales of Simponi were $331 million in 2012, $264 million in 2011 and $97 million in 2010. The revenue increases were driven by growth in the Retained Territories due in part to ongoing launches. In July 2012, a submission was made to the European Medicines Agency (the &#147;EMA&#148;) requesting approval of Simponi for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n\n&#160; \n\nInfectious Disease \n\nWorldwide sales of Isentress, an HIV integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, grew 11% in 2012 to $1.5 billion driven primarily by volume growth in the United States, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Global sales of Isentress rose 25% in 2011 to $1.4 billion reflecting volume growth in the United States and internationally, partially offset by unfavorable pricing in European markets. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 4% in 2012 and favorably affected sales performance by 3% in 2011. \n\nWorldwide sales of PegIntron , a treatment for chronic hepatitis C, declined 1% in 2012 to $653 million, including an unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of 4%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales performance reflects volume growth and favorable pricing in the United States and volume growth in certain of the emerging markets. Sales of PegIntron declined 11% in 2011 to $657 million, including a 4% favorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting competitive pressures. \n\nGlobal sales of Cancidas , an anti-fungal product, declined 3% in 2012 to $619 million, including a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales performance in 2012 reflects growth in the emerging markets. Sales of Cancidas grew 5% in 2011 to $640 million, including a 4% favorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting higher sales in Europe and Canada, partially offset by declines in the United States. \n\nGlobal sales of Victrelis , the Company&#146;s innovative oral medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, were $502 million in 2012 compared with $140 million in 2011, driven by post-launch growth in the United States and internationally, particularly in Europe. Victrelis was approved by the FDA in May 2011 and by the EC in July 2011. Victrelis is approved in 70 countries and has launched in 45 of those markets. \n\nSales of Primaxin , an anti-bacterial product, declined 25% in 2012 to $384 million and decreased 16% in 2011 to $515 million. Patents on Primaxin have expired worldwide and multiple generics have been launched. \n\nOncology \n\nSales of Temodar (marketed as Temodal outside the United States), a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, declined 2% in 2012 to $917 million, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. Sales declines in Europe from generic competition were offset by price increases in the United States. Sales of Temodar decreased 12% in 2011 to $935 million, including a 3% favorable effect from foreign exchange, primarily reflecting generic competition in Europe. Temodar lost patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. As previously disclosed, by agreement, a generic manufacturer may launch a generic version of Temodar in the United States in August 2013. Accordingly, the Company anticipates U.S. sales of Temodar , which were $423 million in 2012, will decline significantly in 2013. The U.S. patent and exclusivity periods will otherwise expire in February 2014. \n\nGlobal sales of Emend , for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and post-operative nausea and vomiting, increased 17% in 2012 to $489 million, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales increase reflects volume growth in the United States and Japan. Sales of Emend increased 11% in 2011 to $419 million primarily reflecting growth in international markets. \n\nOther \n\nWorldwide sales of ophthalmic products Cosopt and Trusopt declined 7% in 2012 to $444 million, including a 4% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. The sales decline primarily reflects lower sales in Europe due to generic erosion and price reductions, mitigated in part by higher Cosopt sales in Japan. Sales of Cosopt and Trusopt declined 1% in 2011 to $477 million, including a 5% favorable impact of foreign exchange, reflecting unfavorable pricing and volume declines in Europe, partially offset by higher Cosopt sales in Japan. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for Cosopt and Trusopt has expired. Trusopt has also lost market exclusivity in a number of major European markets. The patent for Cosopt will expire in a number of major European markets in March 2013 and the Company expects sales in those markets to decline significantly thereafter. \n\nBridion (sugammadex sodium injection), for the reversal of certain muscle relaxants used during surgery, is approved and has been launched in many countries outside of the United States. Sales of Bridion were $261 million in 2012, $201 million in 2011 and $103 million in 2010. Sugammadex sodium injection is currently under review by the FDA. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, the FDA approved Saphris (asenapine), an antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in adults. In 2010, asenapine, sold under the brand name Sycrest , received marketing approval in the EU for the treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults. In 2010, Merck and H. Lundbeck A/S (&#147;Lundbeck&#148;) announced a worldwide commercialization agreement for Sycrest sublingual tablets (5 mg, 10 mg). Under the terms of the agreement, Lundbeck paid a fee and makes product supply payments in exchange for exclusive commercial rights to Sycrest in all markets outside the United States, China and Japan. Merck&#146;s sales of Saphris were $166 million in 2012 and $120 million in 2011. Merck continues to focus on building and maintaining the brand awareness of Saphris in the United States. If these efforts in the United States or Lundbeck&#146;s on-going launch of the product in the EU are not successful, the Company may take a non-cash impairment charge with respect to the value of the Saphris/Sycrest intangible asset, which had a carrying value of approximately $550 million at December 31, 2012. If the Saphris/Sycrest intangible asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment charge could be material. \n\nOther products contained in Hospital and Specialty include among others, Invanz , for the treatment of certain infections; Noxafil , for the prevention of certain invasive fungal infections; and Integrilin, a treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold by the Company in the United States and Canada. \n\nDiversified Brands \n\nMerck&#146;s diversified brands include human health pharmaceutical products that are approaching the expiration of their marketing exclusivity or are no longer protected by patents in developed markets, but continue to be a core part of the Company&#146;s offering in other markets around the world. \n\nGlobal sales of Cozaar and its companion agent Hyzaar (a combination of Cozaar and hydrochlorothiazide), treatments for hypertension, declined 23% in 2012 to $1.3 billion and decreased 21% in 2011 to $1.7 billion. The patents that provided market exclusivity for Cozaar and Hyzaar in the United States and in a number of major international markets have expired. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing significant declines in Cozaar and Hyzaar sales and the Company expects the declines to continue. \n\nOther products contained in Diversified Brands include among others, Propecia , a product for the treatment of male pattern hair loss; Zocor , a statin for modifying cholesterol; prescription Claritin , a treatment for seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies; Remeron , an antidepressant; Proscar, a urology product for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostate enlargement; and Vasotec and Vaseretic , hypertension and/or heart failure products. The formulation/use patent that provides U.S. market exclusivity for Propecia expires in October 2013; however, as previously disclosed, by agreement, one generic manufacturer entered the U.S. market in January 2013 and another has been given the right to enter in July 2013. Accordingly, the Company anticipates U.S. sales of Propecia , which were $124 million in 2012, will decline significantly in 2013. \n\nVaccines \n\nThe following discussion of vaccines does not include sales of vaccines sold in most major European markets through Sanofi Pasteur MSD (&#147;SPMSD&#148;), the Company&#146;s joint venture with Sanofi Pasteur, the results of which are reflected in Equity income from affiliates (see &#147;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#148; below). Supply sales to SPMSD, however, are included. \n\nWorldwide sales of Gardasil recorded by Merck grew 35% in 2012 to $1.6 billion driven primarily by growth in the United States, reflecting continued uptake in males and approximately $45 million of government purchases for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the &#147;CDC&#148;) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile, as well as growth in the emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, and in Japan. Sales of Gardasil rose 22% in 2011 to $1.2 billion driven by greater uptake in males in the United States, higher sales in conjunction with the launch in Japan and growth in emerging markets, partially offset by lower government orders in Canada. Gardasil, the world&#146;s top-selling HPV vaccine, is indicated for girls and women 9 through 26 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18, certain precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. Gardasil is also approved in the United States for use in boys and men 9 through 26 years of age for the prevention of anal cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18, anal dysplasias and precancerous lesions caused by HPV \n\n&#160; \n\ntypes 6, 11, 16 and 18, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. The Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements with respect to Gardasil (including a cross-license and settlement agreement with GlaxoSmithKline). As a result of these agreements, the Company pays royalties on worldwide Gardasil sales of 21% to 27% which vary by country and are included in Materials and production costs. \n\nIn recent years, the Company has experienced difficulties in producing its varicella zoster virus (&#147;VZV&#148;)-containing vaccines. These difficulties have resulted in supply constraints for ProQuad , Varivax and Zostavax . The Company has resolved the supply constraints in the United States and anticipates limited launches in international markets for Zostavax in 2013 as noted below. \n\nProQuad , a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, one of the VZV-containing vaccines, became available again in the United States for ordering in October 2012. Merck&#146;s sales of ProQuad were $61 million in 2012, $34 million in 2011 and $134 million in 2010. Sales in all of these years were affected by supply constraints. \n\nMerck&#146;s sales of Varivax, a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), were $846 million in 2012, $831 million in 2011 and $929 million in 2010. Sales for 2010 reflect $48 million of government purchases for the CDC&#146;s Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile. Merck&#146;s sales of M-M-R II, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, were $365 million in 2012, $337 million in 2011 and $315 million in 2010. Sales growth in 2012 was driven primarily by higher volumes in the United States. Sales of Varivax and M-M-R II were affected by ProQuad supply constraints discussed above. \n\nMerck&#146;s sales of Zostavax, a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster) in adults 50 years of age and older, were $651 million in 2012, $332 million in 2011 and $243 million in 2010. Sales performance in 2012 reflects supply availability and increased promotional efforts in the United States. Sales in 2011 and 2010 were affected by supply issues. The Company anticipates limited launches outside of the United States later in 2013. \n\nMerck&#146;s sales of RotaTeq, a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, declined 8% in 2012 to $601 million reflecting favorable public sector inventory fluctuations in 2011, partially offset by volume growth in the emerging markets and Japan in 2012. Merck&#146;s sales of RotaTeq grew 25% in 2011 to $651 million reflecting favorable public sector inventory fluctuations and growth in emerging markets. \n\nMerck&#146;s sales of Pneumovax , a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, grew 17% in 2012 to $580 million due primarily to growth in the United States as a result of price increases and higher volumes, partially offset by declines in Japan. Sales of Pneumovax increased 33% in 2011 to $498 million due to positive performance in the United States, due in part to favorable pricing, and growth in Japan. \n\nMerck&#146;s adult formulation of Vaqta , a vaccine against hepatitis A which was experiencing supply issues, became available in the third quarter of 2012. \n\nOther Segments \n\nAnimal Health \n\nAnimal Health includes pharmaceutical and vaccine products for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major farm and companion animal species. Animal Health sales are affected by intense competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. Global sales of Animal Health products grew 4% in 2012 to $3.4 billion and increased 11% in 2011 to $3.3 billion. Foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 5% in 2012 and favorably affected global sales performance by 4% in 2011. The increase in sales in both periods was driven by positive performance among cattle, poultry, companion animal and swine products. \n\nConsumer Care \n\nConsumer Care products include over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products such as Claritin non-drowsy antihistamines; MiraLAX , for the relief of occasional constipation; Dr. Scholl&#146;s foot care products; and Coppertone sun care products. Global sales of Consumer Care products grew 6% in 2012, including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, to $2.0 billion reflecting higher sales of Dr. Scholl&#146;s , Coppertone , MiraLAX and Claritin , partially offset by lower sales of Marvelon , an oral contraceptive, which is an over-the- \n\n&#160; \n\ncounter product in China. Sales increased 1% in 2011 to $1.8 billion reflecting strong performance of Coppertone , offset by declines in Dr. Scholl&#146;s and Claritin . Consumer Care product sales are affected by competition and consumer spending patterns. In January 2013, the FDA approved Oxytrol for Women , the first and only over-the-counter treatment for overactive bladder in women, which the Company anticipates will be available to customers in fall 2013. \n\nAlliances \n\nThe alliances segment includes results from the Company&#146;s relationship with AZLP. Revenue from AZLP, primarily relating to sales of Nexium and Prilosec, was $915 million in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $1.3 billion in 2010. AstraZeneca has an option to buy Merck&#146;s interest in a subsidiary, and through it, Merck&#146;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec, exercisable in 2014, and the Company believes that it is likely that AstraZeneca will exercise that option (see &#147;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#148; below). If AstraZeneca exercises its option, the Company will no longer record equity income from AZLP and supply sales to AZLP will decline substantially. \n\nCosts, Expenses and Other \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Materials and production \n\n&#160; $ 16,446 &#160; &#160; &#160; -3 % &#160; $ 16,871 &#160; &#160; &#160; -8 % &#160; $ 18,396 &#160; Marketing and administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 12,776 &#160; &#160; &#160; -7 % &#160; &#160; 13,733 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 13,125 &#160; Research and development (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 8,168 &#160; &#160; &#160; -4 % &#160; &#160; 8,467 &#160; &#160; &#160; -24 % &#160; &#160; 11,111 &#160; Restructuring costs \n\n&#160; &#160; 664 &#160; &#160; &#160; -49 % &#160; &#160; 1,306 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33 % &#160; &#160; 985 &#160; Equity income from affiliates \n\n&#160; &#160; (642 ) &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; (610 ) &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; (587 ) Other (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; 946 &#160; &#160; &#160; -27 % &#160; &#160; 1,304 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 38,528 &#160; &#160; &#160; -5 % &#160; $ 40,713 &#160; &#160; &#160; -8 % &#160; $ 44,334 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Includes $200 million, $587 million and $2.4 billion of IPR&#38;D impairment charges in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Materials and Production \n\nMaterials and production costs were $16.4 billion in 2012, $16.9 billion in 2011 and $18.4 billion in 2010. Costs include expenses for the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions which totaled $4.9 billion in each of 2012 and 2011 and $4.6 billion in 2010. Additionally, expenses in 2011 and 2010 include $89 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to Schering-Plough&#146;s inventories recognized as a result of the Merger. Costs in 2011 include an intangible asset impairment charge of $118 million. The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to product intangibles that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with mergers and acquisitions and such charges could be material. Also included in materials and production were costs associated with restructuring activities which amounted to $188 million, $348 million and $429 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, including accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. Separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs as discussed below. \n\nGross margin was 65.2% in 2012 compared with 64.9% in 2011 and 60.0% in 2010. The amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as the restructuring and impairment charges noted above reduced gross margin by 10.7 percentage points in 2012, 11.4 percentage points in 2011 and 15.2 percentage points in 2010. Excluding these impacts, the gross margin decline in 2012 as compared with 2011 reflects the significant decline in Singulair sales as a result of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity, partially offset by improvements resulting from other changes in product mix. The Company anticipates that gross margin will continue to be negatively affected by the Singulair U.S. patent expiry which occurred in August 2012 and by the Singulair patent expiries in major European markets which occurred in February 2013. In addition, anticipated generic competition in the United States for Maxalt and Propecia will also negatively impact gross margin in 2013. The gross margin improvement in 2011 as compared with 2010 reflects changes in product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, as well as a benefit from foreign exchange. \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketing and Administrative \n\nMarketing and administrative expenses declined 7% in 2012 to $12.8 billion due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange, a decline in promotion costs and lower selling costs resulting from restructuring activities. Marketing and administrative expenses grew 5% to $13.7 billion in 2011 due in part to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange and strategic investments made in emerging markets. Marketing and administrative expenses in 2012 and 2011 include $190 million and $162 million, respectively, of expenses for the annual health care reform fee required as part of U.S. health care reform legislation. Expenses for 2012, 2011 and 2010 include restructuring costs of $90 million, $119 million and $144 million, respectively, related primarily to accelerated depreciation for facilities to be closed or divested. Separation costs associated with sales force reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs as discussed below. Expenses also include $272 million, $278 million and $379 million of acquisition-related costs in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, consisting of incremental, third-party integration costs related to the Merger, including costs related to legal entity and system integration. Acquisition- related costs for 2011 also consist of severance costs associated with the acquisition of Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which are not part of the Company&#146;s formal restructuring programs. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nResearch and development expenses were $8.2 billion in 2012, $8.5 billion in 2011 and $11.1 billion in 2010. Research and development expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (&#147;MRL&#148;), the Company&#146;s research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were approximately $4.5 billion in each of 2012 and 2011 and were $4.9 billion in 2010. Also included in research and development expenses are costs incurred by other divisions in support of research and development activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, as well as certain costs from operating segments, including the Pharmaceutical, Animal Health and Consumer Care segments, which in the aggregate were $3.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Research and development expenses in 2012 and 2011 were favorably affected by cost savings resulting from restructuring activities. Included in research and development expenses in 2012 were upfront payments of approximately $260 million related to agreements with Endocyte and AiCuris. (See &#147;Research and Development&#148; below.) \n\nResearch and development expenses also include in-process research and development (&#147;IPR&#38;D&#148;) impairment charges and research and development-related restructuring charges. During 2012, the Company recorded $200 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges primarily for pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were subsequently deemed to have no alternative use during the period. During 2011, the Company recorded IPR&#38;D impairment charges of $587 million primarily for pipeline programs that were abandoned and determined to have no alternative use, as well as for expected delays in the launch timing or changes in the cash flow assumptions for certain compounds. In addition, the impairment charges related to pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were either deemed to have no alternative use during the period or were out-licensed to a third party for consideration that was less than the related asset&#146;s carrying value. During 2010, the Company recorded $2.4 billion of IPR&#38;D impairment charges. Of this amount, $1.7 billion related to the write-down of the intangible asset for vorapaxar resulting from developments in the clinical program for this compound. The remaining $763 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges recorded in 2010 were attributable to compounds that were abandoned and determined to have either no alternative use or were returned to the respective licensor, as well as from expected delays in the launch timing or changes in the cash flow assumptions for certain compounds. The Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future for the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with mergers and acquisitions and such charges could be material. Research and development expenses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 reflect $57 million, $138 million and $428 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation and asset abandonment costs associated with restructuring activities. In 2012, the Company recorded an adjustment to accelerated depreciation costs included in research and development expenses revising previously recorded amounts for certain facilities. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nTotal pretax share-based compensation expense was $335 million in 2012, $369 million in 2011 and $509 million in 2010. At December 31, 2012, there was $370 million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be \n\n&#160; \n\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. For segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses. \n\nRestructuring Costs \n\nRestructuring costs were $664 million, $1.3 billion and $985 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Nearly all of the costs recorded in 2012 and 2011 relate to the Merger Restructuring Program. Of the restructuring costs recorded in 2010, $915 million related to the Merger Restructuring Program, $77 million related to the global restructuring program initiated in 2008 (the &#147;2008 Restructuring Program&#148;) and the remaining activity related to the legacy Schering-Plough program, which included a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, separation costs of $489 million, $1.1 billion and $768 million, respectively, were incurred associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Merck eliminated approximately 4,255 positions in 2012 (of which 3,975 related to the Merger Restructuring Program, 155 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program and 125 related to the legacy Schering-Plough program), approximately 7,590 positions in 2011 (of which 6,880 related to the Merger Restructuring Program, 450 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program and 260 related to the legacy Schering-Plough program) and approximately 12,465 positions in 2010 (of which 11,410 related to the Merger Restructuring Program, 890 related to the 2008 Restructuring Program and 165 to the legacy Schering-Plough program). These position eliminations are comprised of actual headcount reductions, and the elimination of contractors and vacant positions. Also included in restructuring costs are curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans, share-based compensation plan costs, as well as contract termination and shutdown costs. For segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses. Additional costs associated with the Company&#146;s restructuring activities are included in Materials and production , Marketing and administrative and Research and development as discussed above. \n\nEquity Income from Affiliates \n\nEquity income from affiliates, which reflects the performance of the Company&#146;s joint ventures and other equity method affiliates, increased 5% in 2012 to $642 million and grew 4% in 2011 to $610 million due primarily to higher partnership returns from AZLP. During 2011, the Company divested its interest in the Johnson &#38; Johnson&#176;Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Company (&#147;JJMCP&#148;) joint venture. (See &#147;Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information&#148; below.) \n\nOther (Income) Expense, Net \n\nOther (income) expense, net was $1.1 billion of expense in 2012 compared with $946 million of expense in 2011 driven primarily by a $493 million net charge in 2012 relating to the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and gains recognized in 2011 of $136 million on the disposition of the Company&#146;s interest in the JJMCP joint venture (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) and $127 million on the sale of certain manufacturing facilities and related assets (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by a $500 million charge in 2011 related to the resolution of the arbitration proceeding involving the Company&#146;s rights to market Remicade and Simponi (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher interest income in 2012. Other (income) expense, net in 2010 was $1.3 billion of expense reflecting a $950 million charge to settle certain litigation related to Vioxx (the &#147; Vioxx Liability Reserve&#148;), charges related to the settlement of certain pending AWP litigation, and $200 million of exchange losses due to two Venezuelan currency devaluations as discussed below, partially offset by $443 million of income recognized upon AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) and $102 million of income recognized on the settlement of certain disputed royalties. \n\nIn February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency (Bol&#237;var Fuertes) from 4.30 VEF per U.S. dollar to 6.30 VEF per U.S. dollar. The Company anticipates that it will recognize losses due to exchange of approximately $150 million in the first quarter of 2013 resulting from the remeasurement of the local monetary assets and liabilities at the new rate. Since January 2010, Venezuela has been designated hyperinflationary and, as a result, local foreign operations are remeasured in U.S. dollars with the impact recorded in results of operations. As noted above, exchange losses for 2010 reflect losses relating to Venezuelan currency devaluations. Effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency to a two-tiered official exchange rate with an &#147;essentials rate&#148; and a &#147;non-essentials rate.&#148; In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced it would \n\n&#160; \n\neliminate the essentials rate effective January 1, 2011. As a result of this announcement, the Company remeasured its December 31, 2010 monetary assets and liabilities at the new official rate. \n\nSegment Profits \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Pharmaceutical segment profits \n\n&#160; $ 25,852 &#160; &#160; $ 25,617 &#160; &#160; $ 23,864 &#160; Other non-reportable segment profits \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,163 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,995 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,849 &#160; Other \n\n&#160; &#160; (20,276 ) &#160; &#160; (21,278 ) &#160; &#160; (25,060 ) Income before income taxes \n\n&#160; $ 8,739 &#160; &#160; $ 7,334 &#160; &#160; $ 1,653 &#160; ##TABLE_END Segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, certain operating expenses directly incurred by the segment, components of equity income or loss from affiliates and depreciation and amortization expenses. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, Merck does not allocate materials and production costs, other than standard costs, the majority of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. Also excluded from the determination of segment profits is the charge related to the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation recorded in 2012, the arbitration settlement charge, the gain on the divestiture of the Company&#146;s interest in the JJMCP joint venture and a gain on the sale of certain manufacturing facilities and related assets recorded in 2011, and the charge for the Vioxx Liability Reserve and the income recognized on AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise both recognized in 2010. In addition, the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and other acquisition-related costs, intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring costs, taxes paid at the joint venture level and a portion of equity income are also excluded from the determination of segment profits. Additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in &#147;Other&#148; in the above table. Also included in &#147;Other&#148; are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing sales, divested products or businesses, and other supply sales. \n\nPharmaceutical segment profits increased 1% in 2012 driven primarily by lower operating expenses mostly offset by the effects of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for Singulair . Pharmaceutical segment profits rose 7% in 2011 driven largely by the increase in sales and the gross margin improvement discussed above. \n\nTaxes on Income \n\nThe effective income tax rates of 27.9% in 2012, 12.8% in 2011 and 40.6% in 2010 reflect the impacts of acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs, partially offset by the beneficial impact of foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects the favorable impacts of a tax settlement with the Canada Revenue Agency (the &#147;CRA&#148;), the realization of foreign tax credits and the impact of a favorable ruling on a state tax matter. In addition, the 2012 effective tax rate reflects the unfavorable impact of the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation for which no tax benefit was recorded and does not reflect any impacts for the R&#38;D tax credit, which expired on December 31, 2011. As a result of legislation passed in 2013 that extended the R&#38;D tax credit, both the 2012 and 2013 R&#38;D tax credits will be recognized in 2013; however, the entire 2012 R&#38;D tax credit will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for 2011 reflects a net favorable impact of approximately $700 million relating to the settlement of Merck&#146;s 2002-2005 federal income tax audit, the favorable impact of certain foreign and state tax rate changes that resulted in a net $270 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities on intangibles established in purchase accounting, and the unfavorable impact of the $500 million charge related to the resolution of the arbitration proceeding with J&#38;J. The 2010 effective tax rate reflects the impact of the Vioxx Liability Reserve for which no tax impact was recorded, a $147 million charge associated with a change in tax law that requires taxation of the prescription drug subsidy of the Company&#146;s retiree health benefit plans which was enacted in the first quarter of 2010 as part of U.S. health care reform legislation, and the impact of AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a $391 million tax benefit from changes in a foreign entity&#146;s tax rate, which resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities on product intangibles recorded in conjunction with the Merger, and the favorable impact of foreign earnings and dividends from the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income and Earnings per Common Share \n\nNet income attributable to Merck &#38; Co., Inc. was $6.2 billion in 2012, $6.3 billion in 2011 and $861 million in 2010. EPS was $2.00 in 2012, $2.02 in 2011 and $0.28 in 2010. The decreases in net income and EPS in 2012 as compared with 2011 were due primarily to the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation, the effects of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for Singulair in 2012 and the favorable impact of tax items in 2011, partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses, lower restructuring costs and lower intangible asset impairment charges in 2012 and the arbitration settlement charge recorded in 2011. The increases in net income and EPS in 2011 as compared with 2010 were primarily due to lower IPR&#38;D impairment charges and amortization of inventory step-up, lower legal reserves and the favorable impact of tax settlements, partially offset by the arbitration settlement charge recorded in 2011 and the income recognized in 2010 on AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise. \n\nNon-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company&#146;s performance used by management that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors&#146; understanding of the Company&#146;s results. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. The excluded items consist of acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. These excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, the information on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, net income and EPS prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Additionally, since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS and the performance of the Company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics. Senior management&#146;s annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS. \n\n&#160; \n\nA reconciliation between GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions except per share amounts) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Pretax income as reported under GAAP \n\n&#160; $ 8,739 &#160; &#160; $ 7,334 &#160; &#160; $ 1,653 &#160; Increase (decrease) for excluded items: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Acquisition-related costs \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,344 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,939 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,403 &#160; Restructuring costs \n\n&#160; &#160; 999 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,911 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,986 &#160; Other items: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Net charge related to settlement of ENHANCE Litigation \n\n&#160; &#160; 493 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Arbitration settlement charge \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 500 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain on disposition of interest in JJMCP joint venture \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (136 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain on sale of manufacturing facilities and related assets \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (127 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Vioxx Liability Reserve \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 950 &#160; Income recognized on AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (443 ) Other \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 15,575 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15,426 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13,549 &#160; Taxes on income as reported under GAAP \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,440 &#160; &#160; &#160; 942 &#160; &#160; &#160; 671 &#160; Estimated tax benefit (expense) on excluded items \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,261 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,697 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,798 &#160; Tax benefit from settlement of federal income tax audit \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 700 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Tax benefit from foreign and state tax rate changes \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 270 &#160; &#160; &#160; 391 &#160; Tax charge related to U.S. health care reform legislation \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (147 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,701 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,609 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,713 &#160; Non-GAAP net income \n\n&#160; &#160; 11,874 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,817 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,836 &#160; Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n&#160; &#160; 131 &#160; &#160; &#160; 120 &#160; &#160; &#160; 121 &#160; Non-GAAP net income attributable to Merck &#38; Co., Inc. \n\n&#160; $ 11,743 &#160; &#160; $ 11,697 &#160; &#160; $ 10,715 &#160; EPS assuming dilution as reported under GAAP \n\n&#160; $ 2.00 &#160; &#160; $ 2.02 &#160; &#160; $ 0.28 &#160; EPS difference (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1.82 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.75 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.14 &#160; Non-GAAP EPS assuming dilution \n\n&#160; $ 3.82 &#160; &#160; $ 3.77 &#160; &#160; $ 3.42 &#160; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Represents the difference between calculated GAAP EPS and calculated non-GAAP EPS, which may be different than the amount calculated by dividing the impact of the excluded items by the weighted-average shares for the applicable year . \n\n##TABLE_END Acquisition-Related Costs \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up, as well as intangible asset impairment charges. Also excluded are incremental, third-party integration costs associated with the Merger, such as costs related to legal entity and system integration, as well as other costs associated with mergers and acquisitions, such as severance costs which are not part of the Company&#146;s formal restructuring programs. These costs are excluded because management believes that these costs are not representative of ongoing normal business activities. \n\nRestructuring Costs \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude costs related to restructuring actions, including restructuring activities related to the Merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). These amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the site, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. The Company has undertaken \n\n&#160; \n\nrestructurings of different types during the covered periods and therefore these charges should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS because it believes it is helpful for understanding the performance of the continuing business. \n\nCertain Other Items \n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain other items. These items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature and generally represent items that, either as a result of their nature or magnitude, management would not anticipate that they would occur as part of the Company&#146;s normal business on a regular basis. Certain other items are comprised of the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the ENHANCE Litigation, the arbitration settlement charge, the gain on the disposition of the Company&#146;s interest in the JJMCP joint venture, the gain associated with the sale of certain manufacturing facilities and related assets, the charge to establish the Vioxx Liability Reserve and the income recognized upon AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise. Also excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are the tax benefits from the settlement of a federal income tax audit, the favorable impact of certain foreign and state tax rate changes that resulted in a net reduction of deferred tax liabilities on intangibles established in purchase accounting, and the tax charge related to U.S. health care reform legislation. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nA chart reflecting the Company&#146;s current research pipeline as of February 22, 2013 is set forth in Item 1. &#147;Business &#160;&#151; Research and Development&#148; above. \n\nResearch and Development Update \n\nThe Company currently has four candidates under regulatory review in the United States and internationally. \n\nMK-4305, suvorexant, an investigational insomnia medicine in a new class of medicines called orexin receptor antagonists for use in patients with difficulty falling or staying asleep, is under review by the FDA. Suvorexant will be evaluated by the Controlled Substance Staff of the FDA during NDA review. If approved by the FDA, suvorexant will become available after a schedule assessment and determination has been completed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which routinely occurs after FDA approval. The Company has also submitted a new drug application for suvorexant to the health authorities in Japan and is continuing with plans to seek approval for suvorexant in other countries around the world. \n\nMK-8616, sugammadex sodium injection, is an investigational agent for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium (neuromuscular blocking agents) under review by the FDA. Neuromuscular blockade is used in anesthesiology to induce muscle relaxation during surgery. If approved, MK-8616 would be the first in a new class of medicines in the United States known as selective relaxant binding agents to be used in the surgical setting. In 2008, the FDA did not approve the original NDA for sugammadex sodium injection, requesting additional data related to hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and coagulation (bleeding) events. Merck submitted these requested data within the NDA resubmission, which the FDA deemed complete for review. The Company expects the FDA&#146;s review to be completed in the first half of 2013. Sugammadex sodium injection is approved and has been launched in many countries outside of the United States where it is marketed as Bridion . \n\nMK-8109, vintafolide, is an investigational cancer candidate under review by the EMA. As part of an exclusive license agreement with Endocyte, Merck is responsible for the development and worldwide commercialization of vintafolide in oncology. The EMA accepted the marketing authorization application filings for vintafolide and Endocyte&#146;s investigational companion diagnostic imaging agent, etarfolatide, for the targeted treatment of patients with folate-receptor positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Both vintafolide and etarfolatide have been granted orphan drug status by the EC. Vintafolide is in Phase III development in the United States. \n\nMK-0653C is an investigational combination of ezetimibe and atorvastatin for the treatment of primary or mixed hyperlipidemia under review by the FDA. An updated NDA for MK-0653C was deemed complete for \n\n&#160; \n\nreview by the FDA after Merck submitted additional data in response to the FDA&#146;s Complete Response Letter issued in 2012. Merck expects the FDA&#146;s review to be completed in the first half of 2013. Merck is continuing to move forward with planned filings for the ezetimibe and atorvastatin combination tablet in additional countries around the world. \n\nIn addition to the candidates under regulatory review, the Company has 16 drug candidates in Phase III development targeting a broad range of diseases. The Company anticipates filing an NDA or a BLA, as applicable, with the FDA with respect to several of these candidates in 2013. \n\nV503 is a nine-valent HPV vaccine in development to help protect against certain HPV-related diseases. V503 incorporates antigens against five additional cancer-causing HPV types as compared with Gardasil . As previously disclosed, the 14,000-patient Phase III event-driven clinical study of V503 is ongoing. Merck anticipates filing a BLA for V503 with the FDA in 2013. \n\nMK-8962, corifollitropin alpha injection, which is being marketed as Elonva in the EU, is an investigational fertility treatment for controlled ovarian stimulation in women participating in in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection currently in Phase III development in the United States. Merck continues to anticipate filing an NDA for MK-8962 with the FDA in 2013. \n\nMK-5348, vorapaxar, is a thrombin receptor antagonist being developed for the prevention of thrombosis, or clot formation, and the reduction of cardiovascular events. Vorapaxar has been evaluated in two major clinical outcomes studies in different patient groups: TRACER (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist for Clinical Event Reduction in Acute Coronary Syndrome), a clinical outcomes trial in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and TRA-2P (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of atherothrombotic ischemic events), a secondary prevention study in patients with a previous heart attack or ischemic stroke, or with documented peripheral vascular disease. In March 2012, results from the TRA-2P study of vorapaxar were presented at the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session and published concurrently in the online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, the addition of vorapaxar to standard of care (e.g. aspirin or thienopyridine or both) resulted in a significantly greater reduction in the risk of the composite of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or urgent coronary revascularization. There was also a significant increase in bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, among patients taking vorapaxar in addition to standard of care, although the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was lower in patients without a history of stroke. In November 2011, researchers presented results from the TRACER outcomes study at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, and the results have been published. TRACER did not achieve its primary endpoint. In January 2011, Merck and the external study investigators announced that the combined DSMB for the two clinical trials had reviewed the available safety and efficacy data, and recommended that patients in the TRACER trial discontinue study drug and investigators close out the study. Following a review of the clinical trial data and discussions with external experts, Merck plans to file applications for vorapaxar in the United States and EU in 2013 seeking an indication for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of heart attack and no history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. \n\nMK-7243 is an investigational allergy immunotherapy sublingual tablet (&#147;AIT&#148;) in Phase III development for grass pollen allergy for which the Company has North American rights. AIT is a dissolvable oral tablet that is designed to prevent allergy symptoms by inducing a protective immune response against allergies, thereby treating the underlying cause of the disease. Merck is investigating AIT for the treatment of grass pollen allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in both children and adults. The Company has submitted a BLA for MK-7243 with the FDA. \n\nMK-3641, an AIT for ragweed allergy, is also in Phase III development for the North American market. The Company anticipates filing a BLA for MK-3641 with the FDA in 2013. \n\nMK-8175A, NOMAC/E2, which is being marketed as Zoely in the EU, is an investigational oral contraceptive for use by women to prevent pregnancy. NOMAC/E2 is a combined oral contraceptive tablet containing a unique monophasic combination of two hormones: nomegestrol acetate, a highly selective progesterone-derived progestin, and 17-beta estradiol, an estrogen that is similar to the one naturally present in a women&#146;s body. In November 2011, Merck received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for NOMAC/E2. The Company is conducting an additional clinical study requested by the FDA and plans to update the application in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nMK-0822, odanacatib, is an oral, once-weekly investigational treatment for osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Osteoporosis is a disease that reduces bone density and strength and results in an increased risk of bone fractures. Odanacatib is a cathepsin K inhibitor that selectively inhibits the cathepsin K enzyme. Cathepsin K is known to play a central role in the function of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down existing bone tissue, particularly the protein components of bone. Inhibition of cathepsin K is a novel approach to the treatment of osteoporosis. In July 2012, Merck announced an update on the Phase III trial assessing fracture risk reduction with odanacatib. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (the &#147;DMC&#148;) for the study completed its first planned interim analysis for efficacy and recommended that the study be closed early due to robust efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile. The DMC noted that safety issues remain in certain selected areas and made recommendations with respect to following up on them. On February 1, 2013, Merck announced that it had recently received and was reviewing safety and efficacy data from the Phase III trial. As a result of its review of this data, the Company concluded that review of additional data from the previously planned, ongoing extension study was warranted and that filing an application for approval with the FDA should be delayed. As previously announced, the Company is conducting a blinded extension of the trial in approximately 8,200 women, which will provide additional safety and efficacy data. Merck now anticipates that it will file applications for approval of odanacatib in 2014 with additional data from the extension trial. The Company continues to believe that odanacatib will have the potential to address unmet medical needs in patients with osteoporosis. \n\nMK-3814, preladenant, is a selective adenosine 2a receptor antagonist in Phase III development for treatment of Parkinson&#146;s disease. The Company anticipates filing an NDA for MK-3814 with the FDA in 2014. \n\nV212 is an inactivated VZV vaccine in development for the prevention of herpes zoster. The Company is enrolling two Phase III trials, one in autologous hematopoietic cell transplant patients and the other in patients with solid tumor malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and hematological malignancies. The Company anticipates filing a BLA first with the autologous hematopoietic cell transplant data in 2014 and filing for the second indication in cancer patients at a later date. \n\nV419 is an investigational hexavalent pediatric combination vaccine, which contains components of current vaccines, designed to help protect against six potentially serious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough ( Bordetella pertussis ), polio (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3), invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B that is being developed in collaboration with Sanofi-Pasteur. The Company anticipates filing a BLA for V419 with the FDA in 2014. \n\nMK-7009, vaniprevir, is an investigational, oral twice-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus for development in Japan only. The Company anticipates filing a new drug application for MK-7009 in Japan in 2014. \n\nMK-3102 is an investigational once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Company anticipates filing an NDA for MK-3102 with the FDA beyond 2014. \n\nMK-3222 is an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody candidate being investigated for the treatment of psoriasis. The Company anticipates filing a BLA for MK-3222 with the FDA beyond 2014. \n\nMK-3415A, actoxumab/bezlotoxumab, an investigational candidate for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection, is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies used to treat patients with a single infusion. The Company now anticipates filing a BLA for MK-3415A with the FDA in 2015. \n\nMK-0859, anacetrapib, is an investigational inhibitor of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (&#147;CETP&#148;) that is being investigated in lipid management to raise HDL-C and reduce LDL-C. Based on the results from the Phase III DEFINE (Determining the EFficacy and Tolerability of CETP INhibition with AnacEtrapib) safety study of 1,623 patients with coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk equivalents, the Company initiated a large, event-driven cardiovascular clinical outcomes trial REVEAL (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification) involving patients with preexisting vascular disease that is predicted to be completed in 2017. The Company continues to anticipate filing an NDA for anacetrapib with the FDA beyond 2015. \n\nMK-8931 is Merck&#146;s novel investigational oral &#223;-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer&#146;s disease. In December 2012, Merck announced the initiation of a Phase II/III clinical trial (EPOCH) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-8931 versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer&#146;s disease. \n\n&#160; \n\nMK-8669, ridaforolimus, is an investigational oral mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor under development for cancer indications. In June 2012, Merck announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding the NDA for ridaforolimus as a treatment for metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma. The Complete Response Letter states that the FDA cannot approve the application in its present form, and that additional clinical trial(s) would need to be conducted to further assess safety and efficacy. In November 2012, Merck formally notified the EMA of its decision to withdraw the marketing authorization application for ridaforolimus that was accepted by the EMA in 2011. The Company no longer plans to pursue the sarcoma indication in the United States or the EU, but will continue to support patients enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. Merck remains committed to pursuing ridaforolimus in other cancer indications. As part of an exclusive license agreement with ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;ARIAD&#148;), Merck is responsible for the development and worldwide commercialization of ridaforolimus in oncology. \n\nIn December 2012, Merck announced the HPS2-THRIVE study of MK-0524A, Tredaptive , did not meet its primary endpoint. In the study, adding the combination of extended-release niacin and laropiprant to statin therapy did not significantly further reduce the risk of the combination of coronary deaths, non-fatal heart attacks, strokes or revascularizations compared to statin therapy. In addition, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of some types of non-fatal serious adverse events in the group that received extended-release niacin/laropiprant compared to statin therapy. Merck does not plan to seek regulatory approval for the medicine in the United States. In January 2013, based on the understanding of the preliminary data from the HPS2-THRIVE study and in consultation with regulatory authorities, Merck began taking steps to suspend the availability of Tredaptive , which is approved for use in certain countries outside of the United States. The clinical development program for MK-0524B, a combination product of extended-release niacin with laropiprant and simvastatin, had previously been discontinued. \n\nIn 2012, Merck announced that it will return the global marketing and development rights for both the intravenous and oral formulations for vernakalant, a treatment for atrial fibrillation, to Cardiome Pharma Corp. for business reasons. Merck also decided in 2012 to discontinue the clinical development program for MK-0431E, a combination product of sitagliptin and atorvastatin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, for business reasons. \n\nThe Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. The Company&#146;s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the Company&#146;s research and development resources on disease areas of unmet medical needs, scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity. Merck is managing its research and development portfolio across diverse approaches to discovery and development by balancing investments appropriately on novel, innovative targets with the potential to have a major impact on human health, on developing best-in-class approaches, and on delivering maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. Another important component of the Company&#146;s science-based diversification is based on expanding the Company&#146;s portfolio of modalities to include not only small molecules and vaccines, but also biologics (peptides, small proteins, antibodies) and RNAi. Further, Merck has moved to diversify its portfolio through biosimilars, which have the potential to harness the market opportunity presented by biological medicine patent expiries by delivering high quality follow-on biologic products to enhance access for patients worldwide. The Company supplements its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as new technologies. \n\nThe Company&#146;s clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, infectious diseases, inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, insomnia, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis, respiratory diseases and women&#146;s health. \n\nIn-Process Research and Development \n\nIn connection with mergers and acquisitions, the Company has recorded the fair value of incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. At December 31, 2012, the balance of IPR&#38;D was $2.4 billion. \n\nSome of the more significant projects in late-stage development include sugammadex sodium injection and an ezetimibe/atorvastatin combination product, both of which are currently under review by the FDA as noted above, as well as vorapaxar, which remains in Phase III clinical development. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring 2012, 2011 and 2010, approximately $78 million, $666 million and $378 million, respectively, of IPR&#38;D projects received marketing approval in a major market and the Company began amortizing these assets based on their estimated useful lives. \n\nAll of the IPR&#38;D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&#38;D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company&#146;s failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. Additionally, if certain of the IPR&#38;D programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not realize the future cash flows it has estimated and recorded as IPR&#38;D as of the acquisition date, and the Company may also not recover the research and development expenditures made since the acquisition to further develop such program. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company&#146;s future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges and such charges could be material. \n\nDuring 2012, the Company recorded $200 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges within Research and development expenses primarily for pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were subsequently deemed to have no alternative use during the period. During 2011, the Company recorded $587 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges primarily for pipeline programs that were abandoned and determined to have no alternative use, as well as for expected delays in the launch timing or changes in the cash flow assumptions for certain compounds. In addition, the impairment charges related to pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were either deemed to have no alternative use during the period or were out-licensed to a third party for consideration that was less than the related asset&#146;s carrying value. \n\nDuring 2010, the Company recorded $2.4 billion of IPR&#38;D impairment charges. The Company determined that the developments in the clinical research program for vorapaxar constituted a triggering event that required the Company to evaluate the vorapaxar intangible asset for impairment. Utilizing market participant assumptions, and considering several different scenarios, the Company concluded that its best estimate of the current fair value of the intangible asset related to vorapaxar was $350 million, which resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of $1.7 billion during 2010. The remaining $763 million of IPR&#38;D impairment charges recorded in 2010 were attributable to compounds that were abandoned and determined to have either no alternative use or were returned to the respective licensor, as well as from expected delays in the launch timing or changes in the cash flow assumptions for certain compounds. \n\nAdditional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for approval. As of December 31, 2012, the estimated costs to complete projects acquired in connection with mergers and acquisitions in Phase III development for human health and the analogous stage of development for animal health were approximately $1.2 billion. \n\nAcquisitions, Research Collaborations and License Agreements \n\nMerck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. During 2012, the Company completed transactions across a broad range of therapeutic categories, including early-stage technology transactions. Merck is actively monitoring the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company&#146;s strategic criteria. \n\nIn October 2012, Merck and AiCuris entered into an exclusive licensing agreement which provides Merck with worldwide rights to develop and commercialize candidates in AiCuris&#146; novel portfolio of investigational medicines targeting human cytomegalovirus (&#147;HCMV&#148;), including letermovir (MK-8228), an oral, late-stage antiviral candidate being investigated for the treatment and prevention of HCMV infection in transplant recipients. AiCuris received an upfront payment of &#128;110 million (approximately $140 million), which the Company recorded as research and development expense, and is eligible for milestone payments of up to &#128;332.5 million based on successful achievement of development, regulatory and commercialization goals for HCMV candidates, including letermovir, an additional back-up candidate as well as other Phase I candidates designed to act via an \n\n&#160; \n\nalternate mechanism. In addition, AiCuris will be entitled to receive royalty payments reflecting the advanced stage of the clinical program on any potential products that result from the agreement. Merck will be responsible for all development activities and costs. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material uncured breach or insolvency. The agreement may be terminated by Merck at any time in the event that any of the compounds licensed from AiCuris develop an adverse safety profile or any material adverse issue arises related to the development, efficacy or dosing regimen of any of the compounds, and/or in the event that certain patents are invalid and/or unenforceable in certain jurisdictions. Merck (i) may terminate the agreement with respect to certain compounds after successful completion of the first proof of concept clinical trial or (ii) must terminate the agreement with respect to certain compounds if Merck fails to minimally invest in such compounds. In addition, Merck may terminate the agreement as a whole at any time upon six months prior written notice at any time after completion of the first Phase III clinical trial for a compound. AiCuris may terminate the agreement in the event that Merck challenges any AiCuris patent covering the compounds licensed from AiCuris. Upon termination of the agreement, depending upon the circumstances, the parties have varying rights and obligations with respect to the continued development and commercialization of compounds and, in the case of termination for cause by Merck, certain royalty obligations. \n\nIn April 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Endocyte to develop and commercialize Endocyte&#146;s novel investigational therapeutic candidate vintafolide (MK-8109). Vintafolide is currently being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial for folate-receptor positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROCEED) and a Phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer. Under the agreement, Merck gained worldwide rights to develop and commercialize vintafolide. Endocyte received a $120 million upfront payment, which the Company recorded as research and development expense, and is eligible for milestone payments of up to $880 million based on the successful achievement of development, regulatory and commercialization goals for vintafolide for a total of six cancer indications. In addition, if vintafolide receives regulatory approval, Merck and Endocyte will share equally profit and losses in the United States. Endocyte will receive a royalty on sales of the product in the rest of the world. Endocyte has retained the right to co-promote vintafolide with Merck in the United States and Merck has the exclusive right to promote vintafolide in the rest of world. Endocyte will be responsible for the majority of funding and completion of the PROCEED trial. Merck will be responsible for all other development activities and development costs and have all decision rights for vintafolide. Merck has the right to terminate the agreement on 90 days notice. Merck and Endocyte both have the right to terminate the agreement due to the material breach or insolvency of the other party. Endocyte has the right to terminate the agreement in the event that Merck challenges an Endocyte patent right relating to vintafolide. Upon termination of the agreement, depending upon the circumstances, the parties have varying rights and obligations with respect to the continued development and commercialization of vintafolide and, in the case of termination for cause by Merck, certain royalty obligations and U.S. profit and loss sharing. Endocyte is responsible for the development, manufacture and commercialization worldwide of etarfolatide, a non-invasive companion diagnostic imaging agent that is used to identify folate receptor positive tumor cells. As discussed above, in 2012, the EMA accepted the marketing authorization application filings for vintafolide and etarfolatide for platinum resistant ovarian cancer. \n\nSelected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information \n\nTo expand its research base and realize synergies from combining capabilities, opportunities and assets, in previous years Merck has formed a number of joint ventures. \n\nAstraZeneca LP \n\nIn 1982, Merck entered into an agreement with Astra AB (&#147;Astra&#148;) to develop and market Astra products under a royalty-bearing license. In 1993, Merck&#146;s total sales of Astra products reached a level that triggered the first step in the establishment of a joint venture business carried on by Astra Merck Inc. (&#147;AMI&#148;), in which Merck and Astra each owned a 50% share. This joint venture, formed in 1994, developed and marketed most of Astra&#146;s new prescription medicines in the United States including Prilosec, the first of a class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors, which slows the production of acid from the cells of the stomach lining. \n\nIn 1998, Merck and Astra completed the restructuring of the ownership and operations of the joint venture whereby Merck acquired Astra&#146;s interest in AMI, renamed KBI Inc. (&#147;KBI&#148;), and contributed KBI&#146;s operating assets to a new U.S. limited partnership, Astra Pharmaceuticals L.P. (the &#147;Partnership&#148;), in exchange for a \n\n&#160; \n\n1% limited partner interest. Astra contributed the net assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, Astra USA, Inc., to the Partnership in exchange for a 99% general partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP (&#147;AZLP&#148;) upon Astra&#146;s 1999 merger with Zeneca Group Plc, became the exclusive distributor of the products for which KBI retained rights. \n\nWhile maintaining a 1% limited partner interest in AZLP, Merck has consent and protective rights intended to preserve its business and economic interests, including restrictions on the power of the general partner to make certain distributions or dispositions. Furthermore, in limited events of default, additional rights will be granted to the Company, including powers to direct the actions of, or remove and replace, the Partnership&#146;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Merck earns ongoing revenue based on sales of KBI products and such revenue was $915 million, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily relating to sales of Nexium, as well as Prilosec. In addition, Merck earns certain Partnership returns which are recorded in Equity income from affiliates. Such returns include a priority return provided for in the Partnership Agreement, a preferential return representing Merck&#146;s share of undistributed AZLP GAAP earnings, and a variable return related to the Company&#146;s 1% limited partner interest. These returns aggregated $621 million, $574 million and $546 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\nIn conjunction with the 1998 restructuring discussed above, Astra purchased an option (the &#147;Asset Option&#148;) for a payment of $443 million, which was recorded as deferred income, to buy Merck&#146;s interest in the KBI products, excluding the gastrointestinal medicines Nexium and Prilosec (the &#147;Non-PPI Products&#148;). In April 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the Asset Option. Merck received $647 million from AstraZeneca representing the net present value as of March 31, 2008 of projected future pretax revenue to be received by Merck from the Non-PPI Products, which was recorded as a reduction to the Company&#146;s investment in AZLP. The Company recognized the $443 million of deferred income in 2010 as a component of Other (income) expense, net . In addition, in 1998, Merck granted Astra an option to buy Merck&#146;s common stock interest in KBI and, through it, Merck&#146;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec as well as AZLP, exercisable in 2012. In June 2012, Merck and AstraZeneca amended the 1998 option agreement. The updated agreement eliminated AstraZeneca&#146;s option to acquire Merck&#146;s interest in KBI in 2012 and provides AstraZeneca a new option to acquire Merck&#146;s interest in KBI in June 2014. As a result of the amended agreement, Merck continues to record supply sales and equity income from the partnership. In 2014, AstraZeneca has the option to purchase Merck&#146;s interest in KBI based in part on the value of Merck&#146;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec. AstraZeneca&#146;s option is exercisable between March 1, 2014 and April 30, 2014. If AstraZeneca chooses to exercise this option, the closing date is expected to be June 30, 2014. Under the amended agreement, AstraZeneca will make a payment to Merck upon closing of $327 million, reflecting an estimate of the fair value of Merck&#146;s interest in Nexium and Prilosec. This portion of the exercise price is subject to a true-up in 2018 based on actual sales from closing in 2014 to June 2018. The exercise price will also include an additional amount equal to a multiple of ten times Merck&#146;s average 1% annual profit allocation in the partnership for the three years prior to exercise. The Company believes that it is likely that AstraZeneca will exercise its option in 2014. If AstraZeneca exercises its option, the Company will no longer record equity income from AZLP and supply sales to AZLP will decline substantially. \n\nSanofi Pasteur MSD \n\nIn 1994, Merck and Pasteur M&#233;rieux Connaught (now Sanofi Pasteur S.A.) established an equally-owned joint venture to market vaccines in Europe and to collaborate in the development of combination vaccines for distribution in Europe. \n\nSales of joint venture products were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Gardasil \n\n&#160; $ 264 &#160; &#160; $ 253 &#160; &#160; $ 350 &#160; Influenza vaccines \n\n&#160; &#160; 161 &#160; &#160; &#160; 183 &#160; &#160; &#160; 220 &#160; Other viral vaccines \n\n&#160; &#160; 107 &#160; &#160; &#160; 105 &#160; &#160; &#160; 93 &#160; RotaTeq \n\n&#160; &#160; 47 &#160; &#160; &#160; 44 &#160; &#160; &#160; 42 &#160; Hepatitis vaccines \n\n&#160; &#160; 31 &#160; &#160; &#160; 39 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; Other vaccines \n\n&#160; &#160; 474 &#160; &#160; &#160; 486 &#160; &#160; &#160; 487 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1,084 &#160; &#160; $ 1,110 &#160; &#160; $ 1,217 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nJohnson &#38; Johnson&#176;Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Company \n\nIn September 2011, Merck sold its 50% interest in the JJMCP joint venture to J&#38;J. The venture between Merck and J&#38;J was formed in 1989 to develop, manufacture, market and distribute certain over-the-counter consumer products in the United States and Canada. Merck received a one-time payment of $175 million and recognized a pretax gain of $136 million in 2011 reflected in Other (income) expense, net . The partnership assets also included a manufacturing facility. Sales of products marketed by the joint venture were $62 million for the period from January 1, 2011 until the September 29, 2011 divestiture date and $129 million for 2010. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nCapital expenditures were $2.0 billion in 2012, $1.7 billion in 2011 and $1.7 billion in 2010. Expenditures in the United States were $1.3 billion in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $990 million in 2010. \n\nDepreciation expense was $2.0 billion in 2012, $2.4 billion in 2011 and $2.6 billion in 2010 of which $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, applied to locations in the United States. Total depreciation expense in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included accelerated depreciation of $235 million, $589 million and $849 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). \n\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nMerck&#146;s strong financial profile enables it to fully fund research and development, focus on external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders. \n\nSelected Data \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Working capital \n\n&#160; $ 16,509 &#160; &#160; $ 16,936 &#160; &#160; $ 13,423 &#160; Total debt to total liabilities and equity \n\n&#160; &#160; 19.4 % &#160; &#160; 16.7 % &#160; &#160; 16.9 % Cash provided by operations to total debt \n\n&#160; &#160; 0.5:1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.7:1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.6:1 &#160; ##TABLE_END Cash provided by operating activities was $10.0 billion in 2012, $12.4 billion in 2011 and $10.8 billion in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects higher contributions of $1.3 billion to its defined benefit plans as compared with 2011. Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 also reflects the payment of $960 million (including interest) related to the resolution of certain litigation related to Vioxx . The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 as compared with 2010 reflects increased results of operations, partially offset by a $500 million payment made to J&#38;J as a result of the arbitration settlement, as well as net payments of approximately $465 million to the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) as a result of the conclusion of its examination of certain of Merck&#146;s federal income tax returns as discussed below. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the Company&#146;s primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders. The global economic downturn and the sovereign debt issues, among other factors, have adversely affected foreign receivables in certain European countries (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company continues to receive payment on these receivables, including significant collections during 2012 in connection with the Spanish government&#146;s debt stabilization/stimulus plan. Additionally, the Company continues to expand in the emerging markets where payment terms tend to be longer. The conditions in the EU and the emerging markets have resulted in an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding thereby adversely affecting cash provided by operating activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash used in investing activities was $6.8 billion in 2012 compared with $2.9 billion in 2011 primarily reflecting higher purchases of securities and other investments, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments. Cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion in 2011 compared with $3.5 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting higher proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments and proceeds from the disposition of certain businesses, partially offset by higher purchases of securities and other investments. In addition, in 2010, proceeds from AstraZeneca&#146;s asset option exercise and a decrease in restricted assets contributed to cash flows from investing activities. \n\nCash used in financing activities in 2012 was $3.3 billion compared with $6.9 billion in 2011. The lower use of cash in financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of debt, lower payments on debt and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by increased purchases of treasury stock, a decrease in short-term borrowings and higher dividends paid to stockholders. Cash used in financing activities was $6.9 billion in 2011 compared with $5.4 billion in 2010. The higher use of cash in financing activities was primarily driven by lower proceeds from the issuance of debt, higher purchases of treasury stock and higher payments on debt, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings. \n\nIn an effort to implement Merck&#146;s strategy to expand product offerings and capabilities in the emerging markets, the Company has and, anticipates in the future, will allocate capital and resources across those regions. \n\nAt December 31, 2012, the total of worldwide cash and investments was $23.4 billion, including $16.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $7.3 billion of long-term investments. Generally 80%-90% of these cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to significant tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated in the form of dividends. The Company records U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States, no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided. The amount of cash and investments held by U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates due to a variety of factors including the timing and receipt of payments in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the United States continues to be the Company&#146;s primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders. \n\nAs previously disclosed, the Canada Revenue Agency (the &#147;CRA&#148;) had proposed adjustments for 1999 and 2000 relating to intercompany pricing matters and, in July 2011, the CRA issued assessments for other miscellaneous audit issues for tax years 2001-2004. In 2012, Merck and the CRA reached a settlement for these years that calls for Merck to pay additional Canadian tax of approximately $65 million. The Company&#146;s unrecognized tax benefits related to these matters exceeded the settlement amount and therefore the Company recorded a net $112 million tax provision benefit in 2012. A portion of the taxes paid is expected to be creditable for U.S. tax purposes. The Company had previously established reserves for these matters. The resolution of these matters did not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\nIn April 2011, the IRS concluded its examination of Merck&#146;s 2002-2005 federal income tax returns and as a result the Company was required to make net payments of approximately $465 million. The Company&#146;s unrecognized tax benefits for the years under examination exceeded the adjustments related to this examination period and therefore the Company recorded a net $700 million tax provision benefit in 2011. This net benefit reflects the decrease of unrecognized tax benefits for the years under examination partially offset by increases to unrecognized tax benefits for years subsequent to the examination period as a result of this settlement. The Company disagrees with the IRS treatment of one issue raised during this examination and is appealing the matter through the IRS administrative process. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 are as follows: \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2014&#151;2015 &#160; &#160; 2016&#151;2017 &#160; &#160; Thereafter &#160; Purchase obligations (1) \n\n&#160; $ 1,241 &#160; &#160; $ 551 &#160; &#160; $ 505 &#160; &#160; $ 176 &#160; &#160; $ 9 &#160; Loans payable and current portion of long-term debt \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,288 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,288 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Long-term debt \n\n&#160; &#160; 15,803 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,129 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,936 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,738 &#160; Interest related to debt obligations \n\n&#160; &#160; 8,758 &#160; &#160; &#160; 800 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,277 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,022 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,659 &#160; ENHANCE Litigation settlement (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 688 &#160; &#160; &#160; 688 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Unrecognized tax benefits (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 739 &#160; &#160; &#160; 739 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Operating leases \n\n&#160; &#160; 835 &#160; &#160; &#160; 203 &#160; &#160; &#160; 318 &#160; &#160; &#160; 169 &#160; &#160; &#160; 145 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 32,352 &#160; &#160; $ 7,269 &#160; &#160; $ 6,229 &#160; &#160; $ 3,303 &#160; &#160; $ 15,551 &#160; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) During 2011, Merck entered into a transaction which will require the Company to make future bulk supply purchases of $150 million over a maximum four-year period commencing upon the occurrence of certain predetermined events. This amount is not reflected in the table because the predetermined events have not yet occurred and therefore the timing of the resulting payments in any given year cannot yet be determined. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company settled the ENHANCE Litigation. Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the Company anticipates it will pay $688 million in 2013 in connection with the settlement; however, the Company expects that $195 million of this amount will be recovered through insurance. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) As of December 31, 2012, the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties of $5.6 billion, including $739 million reflected as a current liability. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement for years beyond 2013 cannot be made. \n\n##TABLE_END Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. Amounts reflected for research and development obligations do not include contingent milestone payments. Also excluded from research and development obligations are potential future funding commitments of up to approximately $130 million for investments in research venture capital funds. Loans payable and current portion of long-term debt reflects $328 million of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders. Required funding obligations for 2013 relating to the Company&#146;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. However, the Company currently anticipates contributing approximately $340 million and $40 million, respectively, to its pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans during 2013. \n\nIn May 2012, the Company terminated its existing credit facilities and entered into a new $4.0 billion, five-year credit facility maturing in May 2017. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company&#146;s commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility. \n\nIn September 2012, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of $2.5 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.1% notes due 2018, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.4% notes due 2022 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.6% notes due 2042. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. The notes of each series are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the Company&#146;s option at varying redemption prices. Proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including contributions to the Company&#146;s pension plans and the repayment of outstanding commercial paper and certain debt maturities. \n\nIn December 2012, the Company filed a securities registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) under the automatic shelf registration process available to &#147;well-known seasoned issuers&#148; which is effective for three years. \n\nEffective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp. (&#147;MSD&#148;) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody&#146;s Investors Service and Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s are Aa3 with a stable outlook and AA with a stable outlook, respectively. These ratings continue to allow access to the capital markets and flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. The Company continues to maintain a conservative financial profile. The Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Despite this strong financial profile, certain contingent events, if realized, which are discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s liquidity and capital resources. The Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the Company to unrecorded financial obligations. \n\nIn November 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share on the Company&#146;s common stock payable in January 2013. \n\nIn April 2011, Merck&#146;s Board of Directors approved additional purchases of up to $5.0 billion of Merck&#146;s common stock for its treasury. The Company purchased $2.6 billion of its common stock (62 million shares) for its treasury during 2012. The Company has approximately $1.9 billion remaining under this program. The treasury stock purchases have no time limit and will be made over time on the open market, in block transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company purchased $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion of its common stock during 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\nFinancial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures \n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments. \n\nA significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives and accounting related to the Company&#146;s foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below. \n\nForeign Currency Risk Management \n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates. \n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the potential for longer-term unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates to decrease the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than three years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales. The portion of sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The hedged anticipated sales are a specified component of a portfolio of similarly denominated foreign currency-based sales transactions, each of which responds to the hedged currency risk in the same manner. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, which provide the Company with a right, but not an obligation, to sell foreign currencies in the future at a predetermined price. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, total changes in the options&#146; cash flows offset the decline in the expected future U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the options&#146; value reduces to zero, but the Company benefits from the increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows. \n\nIn connection with the Company&#146;s revenue hedging program, a purchased collar option strategy may be utilized. With a purchased collar option strategy, the Company writes a local currency call option and purchases a local currency put option. As compared to a purchased put option strategy alone, a purchased collar strategy reduces \n\n&#160; \n\nthe upfront costs associated with purchasing puts through the collection of premium by writing call options. If the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the purchased put option value of the collar strategy reduces to zero and the Company benefits from the increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its anticipated foreign currency cash flows, however this benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the written call option value of the collar strategy reduces to zero and the changes in the purchased put cash flows of the collar strategy would offset the decline in the expected future U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. \n\nThe Company may also utilize forward contracts in its revenue hedging program. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the increase in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the decrease in the expected future U.S. dollar cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the increase in the value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows. While a weaker U.S. dollar would result in a net benefit, the market value of Merck&#146;s hedges would have declined by an estimated $453 million and $330 million, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Because Merck principally uses purchased local currency put options, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these options. The sensitivity measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck&#146;s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nThe primary objective of the balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets of foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. In these instances, Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts, which enable the Company to buy and sell foreign currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates and economically offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange from the monetary assets. Merck routinely enters into contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro and Japanese yen. For exposures in developing country currencies, the Company will enter into forward contracts to partially offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The Company will also minimize the effect of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities by managing operating activities and net asset positions at the local level. \n\nA sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2012, Income before taxes would have declined by approximately $20 million in 2012. Because the Company was in a net short position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in a net long position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, therefore a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced Income before taxes by approximately $165 million. This measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck&#146;s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nIn February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency (Bol&#237;var Fuertes) from 4.30 VEF per U.S. dollar to 6.30 VEF per U.S. dollar. The Company anticipates that it will recognize losses due to exchange of approximately $150 million in the first quarter of 2013 resulting from the remeasurement of the local monetary assets and liabilities at the new rate. Since January 2010, Venezuela has been designated hyperinflationary and, as a \n\n&#160; \n\nresult, local foreign operations are remeasured in U.S. dollars with the impact recorded in results of operations. In addition, effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency to a two-tiered official exchange rate with an &#147;essentials rate&#148; and a &#147;non-essentials rate.&#148; In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced it would eliminate the essentials rate effective January 1, 2011. As a result of this announcement, the Company remeasured its December 31, 2010 monetary assets and liabilities at the new official rate. \n\nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The Company hedges a portion of the net investment in certain of its foreign operations and measures ineffectiveness based upon changes in spot foreign exchange rates. The effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within Other Comprehensive Income (&#147; OCI &#148;), and remains in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#147; AOCI&#148;) until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. The Company&#146;s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI . \n\nInterest Rate Risk Management \n\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk. \n\nDuring 2011, the Company terminated pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes. These swaps effectively converted certain of its fixed-rate notes to floating-rate instruments. The interest rate swap contracts were designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) swap rate. As a result of the swap terminations, the Company received $288 million in cash, which included $43 million in accrued interest. The corresponding $245 million basis adjustment of the debt associated with the terminated interest rate swap contracts was deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the respective term of the notes. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nThe Company&#146;s investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company&#146;s medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company&#146;s fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of Merck&#146;s investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $1.2 billion each year. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2012 and 2011 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $1.4 billion each year. The fair value of Merck&#146;s debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of Merck&#146;s investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nThe Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management&#146;s best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities, primarily IPR&#38;D and other intangible assets, as well as subsequent fair \n\n&#160; \n\nvalue measurement. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements. \n\nMergers and Acquisitions \n\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the merger or acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. If the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company&#146;s intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements after the date of the merger or acquisition. If the Company determines the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&#38;D, are determined utilizing information available near the merger or acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&#38;D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project, Merck will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset and begin amortization. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an &#147;income approach&#148; through which fair value is estimated based on each asset&#146;s discounted projected net cash flows. The Company&#146;s estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the Company&#146;s competitors; and the life of each asset&#146;s underlying patent, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate. \n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&#38;D are determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset&#146;s probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenues from sales of products are recognized at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss passes to the customer. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds and completion of all performance obligations. Domestically, sales discounts are issued to customers as direct discounts at the point-of-sale or indirectly through an intermediary wholesaler, known as chargebacks, or indirectly in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of money discounts for customers for which collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year. \n\nThe provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases directly through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product at its contracted price plus a mark-up from the wholesaler. The wholesaler, in turn, charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company&#146;s wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. The provision is based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage and contract performance by the benefit provider customers. \n\nThe Company uses historical customer segment mix, adjusted for other known events, in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate indirect customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other customers to the amounts accrued. Adjustments are recorded when trends or significant events indicate that a change in the estimated provision is appropriate. \n\nThe Company continually monitors its provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts. There were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate indirect customer discount provision in 2012, 2011 or 2010. \n\nSummarized information about changes in the aggregate indirect customer discount accrual is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ($ in millions) &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Balance January 1 \n\n&#160; $ 1,824 &#160; &#160; $ 1,307 &#160; Current provision \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,694 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,392 &#160; Adjustments to prior years \n\n&#160; &#160; 89 &#160; &#160; &#160; 81 &#160; Payments \n\n&#160; &#160; (5,734 ) &#160; &#160; (4,956 ) Balance December 31 \n\n&#160; $ 1,873 &#160; &#160; $ 1,824 &#160; ##TABLE_END Accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued balances relative to these provisions included in Accounts receivable and Accrued and other current liabilities were $120 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2012 and were $87 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011. \n\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns provision for U.S. pharmaceutical sales was approximately 1.0% of U.S. net pharmaceutical sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010. \n\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs \n\n&#160; \n\nallow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns. \n\nWholesalers generally provide only the above mentioned data to the Company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. Given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the Company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns. \n\nInventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches \n\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in Phase III clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. The Company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the Company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $196 million and $127 million, respectively. \n\nContingencies and Environmental Liabilities \n\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as additional matters such as antitrust actions. (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.) The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. \n\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company&#146;s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 of approximately $260 million and $240 million, respectively, represents the Company&#146;s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which \n\n&#160; \n\nother potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined. \n\nThe Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and providing for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually. \n\nThe Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $14 million in 2012, and are estimated at $84 million in the aggregate for the years 2013 through 2017. In management&#146;s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $145 million and $171 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $112 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. \n\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nNet periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $509 million in 2012, $665 million in 2011 and $696 million in 2010. The decline in net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2012 as compared with 2011 and 2010 is largely attributable to the benefit plan design changes approved in December 2011 (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). Pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. \n\nThe Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. At December 31, 2012, the discount rates for the Company&#146;s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 3.00% to 4.20% compared with a range of 4.00% to 5.00% at December 31, 2011. \n\nThe expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data as well as actual returns on the Company&#146;s plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. As a result of this analysis, for 2013, the Company&#146;s expected rate of return will range from 6.00% to 8.75% compared to a range of 5.75% to 8.75% in 2012 for its U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company&#146;s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated 45% to 60% in U.S. equities, 20% to 30% in international equities, 15% to 25% in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in cash and other investments. The portfolio&#146;s equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans&#146; benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 13%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines. \n\nActuarial assumptions are based upon management&#146;s best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $67 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on its net periodic benefit cost. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $34 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on its net periodic benefit cost. Required funding obligations for 2013 relating to the Company&#146;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. The preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the Company&#146;s funding requirements. \n\nNet loss amounts, which reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of AOCI . Expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the Company&#146;s expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Also, net loss amounts in AOCI in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. Amortization of net losses for the Company&#146;s U.S. plans at December 31, 2012 is expected to increase net periodic benefit cost by approximately $7 million annually from 2013 through 2017. \n\nRestructuring Costs \n\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring programs designed to reduce the cost structure, increase efficiency and enhance competitiveness. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. When accruing these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. In connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. Severance and other related costs are reflected within Restructuring costs . Asset-related charges are reflected within Materials and production costs, Marketing and administrative expenses and Research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset. \n\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets \n\nThe Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company&#146;s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nThe Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset&#146;s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach. \n\n&#160; \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company&#146;s share price. Additionally, the Company evaluates the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the last date a valuation was performed. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. \n\nOther acquired intangibles (excluding IPR&#38;D) are recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or circumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows. \n\nIPR&#38;D represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects that the Company acquires through business combinations which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the project. The Company tests IPR&#38;D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, through a one-step test that compares the fair value of the IPR&#38;D intangible asset with its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, the Company may combine separately recorded IPR&#38;D intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the Company will combine IPR&#38;D intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized within the Company&#146;s operating results. \n\nImpairments of Investments \n\nThe Company reviews its investments for impairments based on the determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. The Company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investments, including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost and, for equity securities, the Company&#146;s ability and intent to hold the investments. For debt securities, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. The remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in OCI . \n\nTaxes on Income \n\nThe Company&#146;s effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company&#146;s quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company&#146;s quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company&#146;s tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management&#146;s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the \n\n&#160; \n\nfinancial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period. (See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.) \n\nTax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements. At December 31, 2012, foreign earnings of $53.4 billion have been retained indefinitely by subsidiary companies for reinvestment; therefore, no provision has been made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of such earnings and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards \n\nIn July 2012, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment. The amended guidance will allow companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. The updated guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The effect of adoption on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations is not expected to be material. \n\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results \n\nThis report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called &#147;forward-looking statements,&#148; all of which are based on management&#146;s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;expects,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;forecasts,&#148; &#147;projects&#148; and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company&#146;s growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product potential and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company&#146;s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. \n\nThe Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the Company&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on this Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and 8-K. In Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of this annual report on Form 10-K the Company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 366, "Negative": 642, "Polarity": -0.2738095235378874, "Subjectivity": 0.07021943573178548}, "similarity_score": 0.9950619130587036, "nlp_result": -0.06492067116838662}
