Total gross margin decreased by 0.6 &#32;percentage points. Various items such as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets and the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to the product gross margin percentage decline. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 1.4 &#32;percentage points, primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses and lower general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were lower due primarily to the absence in the current fiscal year of impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.1 &#32;percentage points, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue, lower restructuring charges, and our continuing focus on expense management. Diluted earnings per share increased by 25% &#32;from the prior year, a result of both a 24% &#32;increase in net income and also, to a lesser degree, from a slight decline of 24 million &#32;shares in our diluted share count. A significant driver of the increase in net income in fiscal 2013 was our realization of additional tax benefits of $1.0 billion, primarily related to a tax settlement with the IRS and the reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&#38;D tax credit. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012&#8212;Business Summary \n\nOur solid fiscal 2013 &#32;performance reflects our continued execution on our financial strategy to deliver profitable growth to maximize shareholder value for the long term. In what continues to be a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, we grew profits faster than revenue, with revenue increasing by 6% , while net income increased by 24% . \n\nIn fiscal 2013 , revenue increased by $2.5 billion . The Americas contributed $2.1 billion &#32;of the increase, led by higher sales in the United States. APJC contributed $0.3 billion &#32;to the revenue increase, led by strong sales growth in India. EMEA added $0.1 billion &#32;to the revenue increase in fiscal 2013. Both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. We encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective, including those related to macroeconomic challenges in much of Europe. We also faced some macroeconomic challenges in APJC, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, which most notably involved China and Japan. Partially offsetting these challenges was solid revenue growth in fiscal 2013 &#32;in certain emerging countries such as Mexico within the Americas, India within APJC, and Russia within EMEA. \n\nFrom a customer markets standpoint, in fiscal 2013 &#32;we had solid revenue growth in the commercial market, as well as growth in the service provider market, due in large part to the acquisition of NDS. The enterprise and public sector customer markets experienced slight declines in revenue in fiscal 2013 &#32;as compared with fiscal 2012. Global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal 2013 , particularly in the Americas, attributable in part to lower U.S. public sector spending during parts of fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012. \n\nIn fiscal 2013 , product revenue increased by $1.7 billion , while service revenue increased by $0.8 billion . The product revenue increase was driven by the following: an increase of $1.0 billion &#32;from Service Provider Video products, driven primarily by the acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013 ; an increase of $0.8 billion &#32;from Data Center products, due to continued strong customer demand; and an increase of $0.5 billion &#32;from Wireless products, due to continued demand for these solutions. These product revenue increases, along with the service revenue contribution, reflect, in our view, the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions, particularly in both the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments. Overall, our product revenue from our core product areas was flat as an increase in revenue from our Switching products was offset by a decrease in revenue from our NGN Routing products. \n\nWe achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal 2013 , and did so in a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment. This included, in particular, weakness in the European economy, lower global public sector spending, and a conservative approach to IT-related capital spending by customers. Notwithstanding improvements we saw in some of these areas during the latter part of fiscal 2013, our business in fiscal 2014 may continue to be impacted by these challenges, as well as other macroeconomic challenges including weakness in certain emerging countries, such as China. \n\nIn order to invest more significantly in our growth opportunity areas of our portfolio including cloud, Data Center, mobility, services, software and security, we will rebalance our resources in fiscal 2014. As a result, we have announced a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. We expect that these actions will position Cisco to invest in these growth opportunities as our business continues to evolve and to drive operational efficiencies. \n\nFourth Quarter Snapshot \n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2012 , revenue increased by 6% , with both product and service revenue increasing by 6% . With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by 7% &#32;in the Americas, increased by 12% &#32;in EMEA, and decreased by 3% &#32;in APJC. Total gross margin decreased by 1.4 &#32;percentage points, primarily as a result of the TiVo patent litigation settlement. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 2.9 &#32;percentage points, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, general and administrative expenses included $202 million of real estate charges, primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.4 &#32;percentage points, primarily as a result of lower general and administrative expenses, lower restructuring and other charges, and also the impact of our revenue increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 17% &#32;from the prior year period, primarily as a result of an 18% &#32;increase in net income. \n\nStrategy and Focus Areas \n\nOur focus continues to be on our five foundational priorities : \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLeadership in our core business (routing, switching, and associated services) which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCollaboration \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nData center virtualization and cloud \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nVideo \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nArchitectures for business transformation \n\n##TABLE_END We believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers&#8217; information technology spending. &#32;&#32;For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business. \n\nOther Key Financial Measures \n\nThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) and annualized inventory turns): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\nCash and cash equivalents and investments \n\n&#160; \n\n$50,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n$48,716 \n\nCash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$12,894 \n\n&#160; \n\n$11,491 \n\nDeferred revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n$13,423 \n\n&#160; \n\n$12,880 \n\nRepurchases of common stock&#8212;stock repurchase program \n\n&#160; \n\n$2,773 \n\n&#160; \n\n$4,360 \n\nDividends \n\n&#160; \n\n$3,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,501 \n\nDSO \n\n&#160; \n\n40 days \n\n&#160; \n\n34 days \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,663 \n\nAnnualized inventory turns \n\n&#160; \n\n13.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.7 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur product backlog at the end of fiscal 2013 &#32;was $4.9 billion , or 10% &#32;of fiscal 2013 &#32;total revenue, compared with $5.0 billion &#32;at the end of fiscal 2012 , or 11% &#32;of fiscal 2012 &#32;total revenue. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. &#32;Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDelivery has occurred. &#32;Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe fee is fixed or determinable. &#32;We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCollectibility is reasonably assured. &#32;We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer&#8217;s payment history. \n\n##TABLE_END In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. \n\nThe amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition , we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. \n\nSome of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition . \n\nAs our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2013 , nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. \n\nRevenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $4.0 billion &#32;and $3.7 billion &#32;as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 , respectively. Technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Our deferred revenue for services was $9.4 billion &#32;and $9.2 billion &#32;as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 , respectively. \n\nWe make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. \n\nAllowances for Receivables and Sales Returns \n\nThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPercentage of gross accounts receivable \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n% \n\nAllowance for credit loss&#8212;lease receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPercentage of gross lease receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n6.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n7.2 \n\n% \n\nAllowance for credit loss&#8212;loan receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPercentage of gross loan receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances, as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer&#8217;s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. \n\nThe allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer&#8217;s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. \n\nBoth accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. \n\nA reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 &#32;was $119 million &#32;and $129 million , respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. \n\nInventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers \n\nOur inventory balance was $1.5 billion &#32;and $1.7 billion &#32;as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 , respectively. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. \n\nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 27, 2013 , the liability for these purchase commitments was $172 million , compared with $193 million &#32;as of July 28, 2012 , and was included in other current liabilities. \n\nOur provision for inventory was $114 million , $115 million , and $196 million &#32;for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 , respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $106 million , $151 million , and $114 million &#32;in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 , respectively. The decrease in our provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal 2013 &#32;was primarily due to the increase in demand for our products resulting in lower inventory levels with our contract manufacturers during fiscal 2013. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. \n\nWarranty Costs \n\nThe liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $431 million &#32;as of July 27, 2013 , compared with $415 million &#32;as of July 28, 2012 . See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities. \n\nThe provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 &#32;was $664 million , $661 million , and $456 million , respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected. \n\nShare-Based Compensation Expense \n\nShare-based compensation expense is presented as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nShare-based compensation expense \n\n$ \n\n1,120 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,401 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,620 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRestricted stock units are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the present value of expected dividends. Restricted stock unit awards with market-based conditions are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. For employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights, these variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends as of the grant date. For employee stock options, we historically have used the implied volatility for two-year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice-binomial model. For employee stock purchase rights, we used the implied volatility for traded options (with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The valuation of employee stock options (granted in prior fiscal years, but for which expense was recognized during the fiscal years presented) is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness, which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. \n\nBecause share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for forfeitures. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $42.7 billion &#32;as of July 27, 2013 , compared with $38.9 billion &#32;as of July 28, 2012 . Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 27, 2013 , consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value. \n\nOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2013 and 2012 , to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. \n\nThe inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 27, 2013 . We had no Level 3 investments in our total portfolio as of July 27, 2013 . \n\nOther-than-Temporary Impairments \n\nWe recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. \n\nIf the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral. \n\nFor publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nImpairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 . There were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 . Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. \n\nWe also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 27, 2013 , our investments in privately held companies were $833 million , compared with $858 million &#32;as of July 28, 2012 , and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $33 million, $23 million , and $10 million &#32;in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 , respectively. \n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments \n\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. \n\nThe goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 &#32;was $21.9 billion &#32;and $17.0 billion , respectively. The increase in goodwill for fiscal 2013 was due in large part to our acquisitions of NDS and Meraki. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 . For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013 , the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $38.7 billion for the Americas, $15.5 billion for EMEA, and $17.8 billion for APJC. We performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of July 27, 2013 &#32;would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. \n\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There was no impairment charge related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2013 . Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $12 million &#32;and $164 million &#32;during fiscal 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&#38;D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 11.1% , 20.8% , and 17.1% &#32;in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 , respectively. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. \n\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. \n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&#38;D tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&#38;D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. \n\nLoss Contingencies \n\nWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. \n\nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States.

Within total revenue growth, product revenue increased by 5% , while service revenue increased by 9% . Our product and service revenue totals reflect revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. The revenue increase was primarily due to the following: the solid performance of our Service offerings, our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013, and increased demand for our Data Center and Wireless products. \n\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. \n\nIn addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , total revenue increased by 7% . Within total revenue growth, product revenue increased by 5% , while service revenue increased by 12% . Our product and service revenue totals reflected revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. The revenue increase was primarily due to the following: the strong performance of our Service offerings; new product transitions taking place in Switching; and increased demand for our Data Center, Service Provider Video, and Wireless products. \n\nProduct Revenue by Segment \n\nThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nProduct revenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,653 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,485 \n\n&#160; \n\n7.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n57.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n55.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n55.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n55.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEMEA \n\n&#160; \n\n10,049 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,788 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n26.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n27.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n28.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAPJC \n\n&#160; \n\n6,327 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,134 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6,134 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,446 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.6 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n16.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n16.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n15.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,029 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n36,326 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,703 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n36,326 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,526 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,800 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nFor fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 7% . The increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by solid growth in the service provider and commercial markets and, to a lesser degree, growth in the enterprise market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due in large part to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Within the Americas segment, we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market, driven by lower sales to the public sector in the United States. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 9% in the United States, 13% in Brazil, and 7% in Mexico. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we experienced some weakness in our business momentum in certain countries within Latin America. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 5% . The increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by growth in the enterprise, service provider and commercial markets. We experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market for the fiscal year. Within the Americas segment, product revenue to the U.S. public sector was flat, as lower product revenue to the U.S. federal government was offset by higher product revenue to state and local government. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 4% in the United States, 10% in Canada, 21% in Mexico, and 14% in Brazil. \n\nEMEA \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nIn fiscal 2013, we experienced a continuation of many of the macroeconomic challenges we faced in EMEA in fiscal 2012. While we did see some improvements in most of the European economy as the fiscal year progressed, we continued to see weakness in southern Europe throughout fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , product revenue in the EMEA segment was flat, as growth in the commercial, service provider and public sector markets was offset by a decline in the enterprise market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 1% in the United Kingdom, 11% in Russia, 4% in Switzerland, and 3% in Spain. These increases were offset by product revenue declines of 3% in each of Germany and France and 13% in the Netherlands. Product revenue for Italy was flat year over year. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , product revenue in the EMEA segment increased by 2% . The increase was across most of our customer markets in the EMEA segment, led by growth in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. We experienced a slight decline in product revenue in the service provider customer market during the fiscal year driven by lower revenue from this customer market in several of the large countries in the region. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 11% in the United Kingdom, 15% in Russia, and 9% in the Netherlands. These increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 23% in Italy, 21% in Spain, 2% in Germany, and 1% in France. \n\nWe believe that the slower growth we experienced in EMEA was a result of weak macroeconomic conditions attributable in large part to the austerity measures taking place in parts of the region. In particular, we experienced weakness in this segment during the second half of fiscal 2012, with a year-over-year decline in product revenue in this segment during the fourth quarter. \n\nAPJC \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nFor fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 3% . We experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial and service provider markets and, to a lesser degree, in the public sector market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due primarily to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 3% in Australia, 34% in India, and 10% in South Korea. These increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 5% in China and 7% in Japan, reflecting certain challenges that we faced in these countries during portions of fiscal 2013, most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 13% . The increase was led by strong product revenue growth in the service provider market, and to a lesser degree, in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 27% in Japan, 17% in China, and 12% in Australia. We experienced a year-over-year product revenue decline of 19% in South Korea, and 4% in India. Our revenue decline in India was due to ongoing business momentum challenges in the public sector customer market. \n\nProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar Products \n\nIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other NGN Routing products); Service Provider Video (connected devices, video software and solutions, cable access and NDS); Collaboration (unified communications and Cisco TelePresence); Wireless; Data Center; Security; and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of emerging technology products and other networking products. \n\nThe following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nProduct revenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSwitching \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,741 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,589 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,589 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,177 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n38.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n40.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n41.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNGN Routing \n\n&#160; \n\n8,230 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,382 \n\n&#160; \n\n(152 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n8,382 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,186 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n21.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n23.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n23.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n23.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nService Provider Video \n\n&#160; \n\n4,852 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,861 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n25.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,861 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,515 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n12.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n10.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCollaboration \n\n&#160; \n\n3,956 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n(237 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n4,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,072 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n10.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWireless \n\n&#160; \n\n2,166 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,659 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n30.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,659 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,400 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n5.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nData Center \n\n&#160; \n\n2,073 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n59.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n86.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurity \n\n&#160; \n\n1,347 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,341 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,341 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,191 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n(339 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(33.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,289 \n\n&#160; \n\n(286 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(22.2 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,029 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n36,326 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,703 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n36,326 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,526 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,800 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSwitching \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nProduct revenue in our Switching category increased by 1% , or $152 million , as higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches and storage products. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 4%, or $366 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 1%, or approximately $76 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to higher sales of Cisco Nexus Series Switches, partially offset by sales declines in certain of our Cisco Catalyst product families. Sales of modular switches decreased due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches, partially offset by higher sales in Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. Product revenue in the Switching category was also negatively impacted by a 24% decrease in sales of storage products. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , product revenue in our Switching category increased by 3% , or $412 million . The increase was primarily due to growth from transitioning products taking place in our Switching product portfolio. The impact of competitive pressures moderated growth, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Within our Switching product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches and storage products were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 11%, or $819 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 8%, or approximately $468 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, and the Cisco Catalyst 3750 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switches. Product revenue in our Switching category was positively impacted by a 12% increase in sales of storage products, primarily stemming from strong growth in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Sales of modular switches decreased primarily due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 4500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. \n\nNGN Routing \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nSales in our NGN Routing product category decreased by 2% , or $152 million , driven by a 3%, or $142 million, decrease in sales of high-end router products and an 8%, or $58 million, decrease in sales of other NGN Routing products. These decreases were partially offset by a 2%, or $47 million, increase in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router product category, we experienced lower sales of our Cisco CRS-1 and CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by continued adoption of our Cisco Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) products. Higher sales in our midrange and low-end router products were driven by the continued adoption of our Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISR) platform. The decline in sales of other NGN Routing products was due to decreased sales of certain other routing and optical networking products. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , product revenue in our NGN Routing product category increased by 2% , or $196 million . The increase in sales of our NGN Routing product category was driven by a 7%, or $332 million, increase in sales of high-end router products, partially offset by a 3%, or $87 million, decline in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router products category, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and higher sales of the Cisco ASR 9000, 5000, and 1000 family of products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 7600 and 12000 Series Routers. Within the midrange and low-end router products category, the decrease was related to the product transition taking place within our Cisco ISR products, as the sales decline in our older generation products had a greater impact than the growth experienced with our Cisco ISR 1900, ISR 2900, and ISR 3900 router products in this category. Sales of other NGN Routing products decreased by 6%, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreased sales of other routing and optical networking products. \n\nService Provider Video \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nOur Service Provider Video products category grew by 26% , or $991 million , due primarily to the acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Higher revenue from our connected devices and higher revenue from our video software and solutions also contributed to the increase. The increase in sales of connected devices products was primarily due to increased sales of cable set-top boxes. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , sales of Service Provider Video products increased by 10% , or $346 million , due to growth in our service provider customer market from increased sales of set-top boxes worldwide. Sales in connected devices increased by 19%, or $408 million, sales in video software and solutions increased by 18%, or $39 million, while sales in cable access decreased by 9%, or $100 million. \n\nCollaboration \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nOur Collaboration product category continues to shift its focus to recurring revenue streams driven by SaaS offerings. Overall, sales of Collaboration products decreased by 6% , or $237 million , primarily due to a decline in sales of Cisco TelePresence Systems and, to a lesser degree, a decline in sales of Unified Communications products. Lower public sector spending in the United States, as well as demand weakness in Europe, were significant drivers of the decline in sales of Cisco TelePresence Systems. We also experienced a decline in sales of Unified Communications products, which was due primarily to lower sales of Unified \n\nCommunications infrastructure products as a result of our sales emphasis on shifting towards products with recurring revenue streams. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , sales of Collaboration products increased by 3% , or $121 million . The increase was due to a 5% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems. Challenges in both the public sector and demand weakness in Europe, along with our execution challenges related to our sales coverage model, contributed to the decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems in fiscal 2012. \n\nWireless \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nSales of Wireless products increased by 31% , or $507 million . This increase reflects the continued customer adoption of and migration to the unified access architecture of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network, and also reflects increased sales of new products in this category as well as sales of products related to our acquisition of Meraki. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , sales of Wireless products increased by 19% , or $259 million . These increases reflect the continued customer adoption of our wireless architecture and new product performance. \n\nData Center \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nWe experienced strong growth in our Data Center product category, which grew by 60% , or $775 million , with strong sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing with our products for both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings. \n\nTo the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , sales of Data Center products increased by 86% , or $602 million , due to increased sales of Cisco Unified Computing System products. The increase was due to the momentum we are experiencing with our products for the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build out, and new customer product purchases. \n\nSecurity \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nSales of Security products were flat as higher sales in high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio were offset by lower sales of our content security products. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012 , as compared with fiscal 2011 , sales of Security products increased by 13% , or $150 million . These increases were primarily due to growth in our network security products driven by the recent update of our firewall security product portfolio. \n\nOther Products \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nWe experienced a 34% , or $339 million , decrease in sales of Other Products due in large part to lower sales of our Linksys products, which product line we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2013. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nThe decrease in sales of Other Products for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower sales of Flip Video camera products in connection with our decision in fiscal 2011 to exit this consumer product line. \n\nService Revenue by Segment \n\nThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nService revenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n$ \n\n6,986 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,333 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n10.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,333 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,723 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n10.7 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of service revenue \n\n66.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n65.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n65.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n65.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEMEA \n\n2,161 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,816 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.9 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of service revenue \n\n20.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n20.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAPJC \n\n1,431 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,351 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,351 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,153 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n17.2 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of service revenue \n\n13.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n10,578 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,735 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n8.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,735 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,692 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,043 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nService revenue experienced solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 6%, and worldwide advanced services, which relate to consulting support services for specific network needs, experienced 16% revenue growth. Technical support service experienced growth across all of our geographic segments, led by growth in our Americas segment. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving these increases. We experienced revenue growth in advanced services across all geographic segments, led by growth in the Americas segment. Advanced services revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both transaction and subscription revenues. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, service revenue experienced double-digit percentage growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 10%, and worldwide advanced services experienced 20% revenue growth. Technical support services revenue grew across all of our geographic segments, with strong revenue growth in our EMEA and APJC segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced, which was the primary driver for these increases. Advanced services revenue also grew across all geographic segments, with particularly strong growth in APJC. The APJC revenue growth in advanced services was led by strength in the second half of fiscal 2012 and was driven by both subscription growth and transaction growth, which was in part the result of the completion of several large, multiyear projects in this region. \n\nGross Margin \n\nThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nAMOUNT \n\n&#160; \n\nPERCENTAGE \n\nYears Ended \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nGross margin: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct \n\n$ \n\n22,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,821 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,879 \n\n&#160; \n\n59.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.5 \n\n% \n\nService \n\n6,952 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,388 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n65.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n65.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n65.1 \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n29,440 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,209 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,536 \n\n&#160; \n\n60.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n61.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n61.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nProduct Gross Margin \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct \n\nGross Margin \n\nPercentage \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n60.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\nSales discounts, rebates, and product pricing \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.9 \n\n)% \n\nMix of products sold \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.7 \n\n)% \n\nProductivity &#160;(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\nTiVo patent litigation settlement \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5 \n\n)% \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5 \n\n)% \n\nAcquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n59.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere. \n\nProduct gross margin decreased by 1.0 &#32;&#32;percentage points compared with fiscal 2012. \n\nHigher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing contributed to our decreased product gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. These impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements. The productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings, particularly in certain of our Switching and NGN Routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place, and were driven by value engineering efforts, favorable component pricing, and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. \n\nBecause the preceding factors largely offset each other, the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of NDS, which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2013 we incurred charges related to the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales. The combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of 1.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013. \n\nOur future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and, as was the case in fiscal 2013 and 2012, may be adversely affected by increased sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain, which in turn could negatively affect gross margin. If any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods, our gross margins could continue to decline. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct \n\nGross Margin \n\nPercentage &#160; (1) \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n60.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nSales discounts, rebates, and product pricing \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4 \n\n)% \n\nMix of products sold \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.9 \n\n)% \n\nProductivity \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\nRestructuring and other charges \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n60.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#32;Beginning in fiscal 2013, we refined our methodology for presenting the items in the preceding table, and accordingly certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal 2012 amounts to conform to the presentation made for the fiscal 2013 amounts. \n\nIn fiscal 2012, product gross margin decreased by 0.4 &#32;percentage points compared with fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of revenue increases in our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and increased revenue in other lower margin products. In fiscal 2012, we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the Flip Video camera product line in fiscal 2011. The negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower restructuring charges, the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets, lower amortization expense in fiscal 2012 and productivity improvements. The productivity improvements were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts, particularly in certain of our Switching products; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. \n\nService Gross Margin \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nOur service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.1 &#32;percentage points for fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012. Although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services, the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcount-related costs, partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012. \n\nOur service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nOur service gross margin percentage increased by 0.5 &#32;percentage points for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services. The benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcount-related and partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2012, as compared with the prior year. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 also added to the increase in service gross margin. \n\nFor fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a 10% increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcount-related costs. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a 20% increase in revenue in fiscal 2012. Partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were, in part headcount related, and higher partner delivery costs. Our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers&#8217; networking devices, applications, and infrastructures. \n\nGross Margin by Segment \n\nThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; \n\nAMOUNT \n\n&#160; \n\nPERCENTAGES \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nGross margin: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,887 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,639 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,766 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n63.0 \n\n% \n\nEMEA \n\n&#160; \n\n7,876 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,605 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,452 \n\n&#160; \n\n64.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n63.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.2 \n\n% \n\nAPJC \n\n&#160; \n\n4,637 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,519 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,143 \n\n&#160; \n\n59.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.8 \n\n% \n\nSegment total \n\n&#160; \n\n30,400 \n\n&#160; \n\n28,763 \n\n&#160; \n\n27,361 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n63.3 \n\n% \n\nUnallocated corporate items (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(960 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(554 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(825 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,440 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,209 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,536 \n\n&#160; \n\n60.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n61.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n61.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#32; The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements (which consisted of $172 million recorded to cost of sales for the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013), and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nWe experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our Americas and APJC segments, while our EMEA segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase. \n\nThe Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, and also due to unfavorable mix impacts, partially offset by productivity improvements. \n\nThe gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and, to a lesser degree, favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing. \n\nThe APJC segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. Partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements, driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume. \n\nThe gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal 2011. \n\nThe Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume, higher service gross margin, lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs, and favorable mix impacts. Significantly lower revenue from the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the Americas segment for fiscal 2012. \n\nThe gross margin percentage decline in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts; higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing; and lower service gross margin due to increased headcount-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment. \n\nThe APJC segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. These decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs. \n\nFactors That May Impact Revenue and Gross Margin \n\nProduct revenue may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in cautious IT-related capital spending in our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our Collaboration and Data Center product categories. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results. \n\nProduct revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers&#8217; ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact product revenue, see &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nOur distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs. \n\nProduct gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models for our offerings such as XaaS; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product revenue; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business. \n\nResearch and Development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (&#8220;G&#38;A&#8221;) Expenses \n\nR&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,942 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n8.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,823 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(335 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.8 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n12.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing \n\n&#160; \n\n9,538 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,647 \n\n&#160; \n\n(109 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n9,647 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,812 \n\n&#160; \n\n(165 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n19.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n20.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n20.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n22.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n2,264 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n(58 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,908 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,744 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,457 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,457 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,543 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(86 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n36.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n37.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n37.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n40.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nR&#38;D Expenses \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expenses for fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in large part to our acquisitions. Partially offsetting these costs was lower share-based compensation expense. For further explanation of the year-over-year decrease in share-based compensation expense, see &#8220;Share-Based Compensation Expense&#8221; below. \n\nWe continue to invest in R&#38;D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&#38;D. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nThe decrease in R&#38;D expenses for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to lower headcount-related expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and lower share-based compensation expense. Additionally, R&#38;D expenses declined due to lower acquisition-related expenses, which were driven by the absence in fiscal 2012 of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year. \n\nSales and Marketing Expenses \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nFor fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , sales and marketing expenses decreased by $109 million , primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser degree, lower discretionary spending and contracted services. These items were partially offset by higher headcount-related expense resulting largely from our acquisitions. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nFor fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $165 million. Marketing expenses decreased by $204 million, which were partially offset by an increase of $39 million in sales expenses. The decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses, lower headcount-related expenses, and lower share-based compensation expense. The increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher project-related services, partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower share-based compensation expense. The decline in headcount-related expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. \n\nG&#38;A Expenses \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nG&#38;A expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , primarily due to the absence in the current year of $202 million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2013 and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal 2013 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporate-level expenses. Corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, \n\nincluded operational infrastructure activities such as IT project implementations, which included investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nG&#38;A expenses increased in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to a net increase of approximately $300 million in real estate charges, primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale, followed by other increased corporate-level expenses. The increase in real estate charges in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to charges of $202 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These increased corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, include increases related to our operational infrastructure such as real estate; IT project implementations, which include further investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems. \n\nPartially offsetting these increases were lower share-based compensation expense, and lower headcount-related expenses due to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. &#32; \n\nEffect of Foreign Currency \n\nIn fiscal 2013, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses by $227 million , or approximately 1.3% , compared with fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses by $90 million , or approximately 0.5% , compared with fiscal 2011. \n\nHeadcount \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nOur headcount increased by 8,410 employees in fiscal 2013 . The increase was attributable to the headcount from acquisitions, the largest of which was NDS, as well as targeted hiring in engineering and services. \n\nIn August 2013, we announced that we are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nOur headcount decreased by 5,186 employees in fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to headcount reductions from the completion of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations and from our restructuring actions initiated in July 2011. Partially offsetting these declines in headcount were headcount increases due to the growth of our service business and targeted hiring in engineering, which includes the hiring of recent university graduates. \n\nShare-Based Compensation Expense \n\nThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nCost of sales&#8212;product \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nCost of sales&#8212;service \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShare-based compensation expense in cost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring and other charges \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nShare-based compensation expense in operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,192 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,382 \n\nTotal share-based compensation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,120 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,401 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,620 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013, and the effect of stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal 2012, and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value. \n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets \n\nThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses (in millions): ##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2013 , compared with fiscal 2012 , was primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013 and from our other fiscal 2013 acquisitions, partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized during fiscal 2013. The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal 2012 and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal 2011. The impairment charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain products from our then consumer product lines. For additional information regarding purchased intangible assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. \n\nRestructuring and Other Charges \n\nFiscal 2011 Plans \n\nIn connection with the Fiscal 2011 Plans (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of approximately $105 million , $304 million , and $799 million &#32;for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. \n\nAugust Fiscal 2014 Plan \n\nIn August 2013, we announced a workforce reduction plan. We are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. We expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We currently estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our financial results in an amount not expected to exceed $550 million consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. \n\nOperating Income \n\nThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,196 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,065 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,674 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n23.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n17.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn fiscal 2013 our results reflect solid execution on delivering profitable growth, as we grew operating income faster than revenue. In fiscal 2013 , as compared with fiscal 2012 , operating income increased by 11% , and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 1.1 &#32;percentage points. The increases resulted from the following: revenue growth of 6%; continuing focus on expense management, which resulted in lower sales and marketing and G&#38;A expenses as a percentage of revenue; and lower restructuring and other charges. \n\nIn fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, operating income increased by 31%, as a percentage of revenue, operating income increased by 4.1 percentage points. The increase resulted from: revenue growth of 7%; effective expense management that resulted in lower total R&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses as a percentage of revenue; lower amortization of purchased intangible assets; lower restructuring and other charges; and lower share-based compensation expense. \n\nInterest and Other Income, Net \n\nInterest Income (Expense), Net &#32; The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\nInterest income \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nInterest expense \n\n(583 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(596 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(596 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(628 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income (expense), net \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInterest income increased slightly in both fiscal 2013 &#32;and fiscal 2012 as compared with the respective prior fiscal years. The slight increases were primarily due to increased interest income earned on financing receivables, partially offset by lower interest income from our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as a result of lower average interest rates. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps and lower expense on our floating-rate notes as the benchmark London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) decreased. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt. \n\nOther Income (Loss), Net &#32; &#32;&#32;The components of other income, net, are summarized as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\nin Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\nin Dollars \n\nGains (losses) on investments, net: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPublicly traded equity securities \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(26 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(45 \n\n) \n\nFixed income securities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(33 \n\n) \n\nTotal available-for-sale investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(78 \n\n) \n\nPrivately held companies \n\n(57 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(70 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(70 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(104 \n\n) \n\nNet gains (losses) on investments \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(40 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(182 \n\n) \n\nOther gains (losses), net \n\n(31 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(40 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(75 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income (loss), net \n\n$ \n\n(40 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(80 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(98 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nThe decrease in net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2013 &#32;compared with fiscal 2012 &#32;was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2013 &#32;as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments. For fiscal 2013 &#32;as compared with fiscal 2012 , the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher realized gains from various private investments, partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture. The change in other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2013 &#32;as compared with fiscal 2012 , was primarily due to an increase in donations and less favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2013 . \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nThe decrease in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2012 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. For fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, the change in net (losses) gains on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to equity method losses related to our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture increasing by $84 million for fiscal 2012. The change in other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2012. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. \n\nFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 \n\nThe provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 11.1% &#32;for fiscal 2013 , compared with 20.8% &#32;for fiscal 2012 . The net 9.7 &#32;percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the IRS and an increase in tax benefits of $144 million, or 1.2 percentage points, due to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&#38;D tax credit in fiscal 2013. \n\nFor a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 \n\nThe provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.8% &#32;for fiscal 2012, compared with 17.1% &#32;for fiscal 2011. The net 3.7 &#32;percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a smaller proportion of net income which was subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the expiration of the U.S. federal R&#38;D tax credit on December 31, 2011, partially offset by other items including a reduction in state taxes. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources. \n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments &#32; The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n7,925 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,799 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,874 \n\n) \n\nFixed income securities \n\n39,888 \n\n&#160; \n\n37,297 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,591 \n\nPublicly traded equity securities \n\n2,797 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,620 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,177 \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n50,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n48,716 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,894 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $12.9 billion , an increase from $11.5 billion &#32;provided for fiscal 2012, and issuance of common stock of $3.3 billion &#32;pursuant to employee stock incentive plans. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of $6.8 billion , cash dividends paid of $3.3 billion , the repurchase of common stock of $2.8 billion &#32;under the stock repurchase program, and capital expenditures of $1.2 billion . The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in net income. \n\nOur total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $40.4 billion &#32;and $42.5 billion &#32;as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 , respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the United States were to be distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance available in the United States as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 &#32;was $10.2 billion &#32;and $6.2 billion , respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sourcefire, which will reduce our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States by approximately $2.7 billion &#32;upon completion of the acquisition. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. \n\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation &#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;In August 2012, as part of our capital allocation strategy, we announced our intent to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock, which objective we accomplished in fiscal 2013. \n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n$ \n\n12,894 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,491 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,079 \n\nAcquisition of property and equipment \n\n(1,160 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,126 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,174 \n\n) \n\nFree cash flow \n\n$ \n\n11,734 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,365 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,905 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this report. \n\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. \n\nThe following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDIVIDENDS \n\n&#160; \n\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM \n\n&#160; \n\nTOTAL \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nPer Share \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nShares \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted-Average Price per Share \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.62 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21.63 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,773 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,083 \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.28 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,501 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16.64 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,360 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,861 \n\nJuly 30, 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.12 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19.36 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,791 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,449 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOn September 3, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per common share to be paid on October 23, 2013 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 3, 2013. \n\nAccounts Receivable, Net &#32; The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nAccounts receivable, net \n\n$ \n\n5,470 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,369 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,101 \n\nDSO \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur accounts receivable net, as of July 27, 2013 &#32;increased by approximately 25% &#32;compared with the end of fiscal 2012. Our DSO as of July 27, 2013 &#32;was higher by 6 &#32;days compared with the end of fiscal 2012, primarily due to the timing of product shipments, as a higher proportion of shipments were made in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013. \n\nInventory Supply Chain &#32; The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nInventories \n\n$ \n\n1,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,663 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(187 \n\n) \n\nAnnualized inventory turns \n\n13.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\nPurchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers \n\n$ \n\n4,033 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,869 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInventory as of July 27, 2013 &#32;decreased by 11% &#32;from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2012, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 4% . On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat compared with the end of fiscal 2012. \n\nThe inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of manufactured finished goods, which in turn was due in part to inventory sold as part of the sale of our Linksys product line. The increase in purchase commitments in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was driven primarily by new product introductions and an increase in customer demand. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. \n\nOur finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products. \n\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, \n\nand adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. \n\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. \n\nFinancing Receivables and Guarantees &#32; We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 27, 2013 , our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFINANCING RECEIVABLES \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCING \n\nGUARANTEES \n\n&#160; \n\nTOTAL \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\nLease \n\nReceivables \n\n&#160; \n\nLoan \n\nReceivables \n\n&#160; \n\nFinanced Service \n\nContracts and Other \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nChannel Partner \n\n&#160; \n\nEnd-User Customers \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross amount less unearned income \n\n$ \n\n3,507 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,649 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,136 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,967 \n\nAllowance for credit loss \n\n(238 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(86 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(20 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(344 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(344 \n\n) \n\nDeferred revenue \n\n(41 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,036 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,109 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(225 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(191 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(416 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,525 \n\n) \n\nNet balance sheet exposure \n\n$ \n\n3,228 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,531 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,080 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,839 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,098 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinancing Receivables &#32; Gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9% &#32;compared with the end of fiscal 2012. The change was primarily due to a 10% &#32;increase in lease receivables and an 18% &#32;increase in financed service contracts and other, partially reduced by an 8% &#32;decline in loan receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term. \n\nFinancing Guarantees &#32; In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. \n\nDeferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees &#32; The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met. \n\nBorrowings \n\nSenior Notes &#32; &#32;The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\nSenior notes: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFloating-rate notes, due 2014 \n\n$ \n\n1,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,250 \n\n1.625% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n2.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2016 \n\n3,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,000 \n\n3.15% fixed-rate notes, due 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.95% fixed-rate notes, due 2019 \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n4.45% fixed-rate notes, due 2020 \n\n2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,500 \n\n5.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2039 \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2040 \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n16,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,000 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 27, 2013 . \n\nOther Debt &#32;Other debt includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements, notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and notes related to our investment in Insieme Networks, Inc. (&#8220;Insieme&#8221;). The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $31 million &#32; and $41 million as of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 , respectively. \n\nCommercial Paper &#32;In fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. As of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 &#32;we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program. \n\nCredit Facility &#32;On February 17, 2012, we terminated our then-existing credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2017. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America&#8217;s &#8220;prime rate&#8221; as announced from time to time, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services, LLC and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 27, 2013, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. \n\nWe may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to February 17, 2019. \n\nDeferred Revenue &#32; The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 28, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nService \n\n$ \n\n9,403 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,173 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nProduct \n\n4,020 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,707 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n13,423 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,880 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nReported as: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrent \n\n$ \n\n9,262 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,852 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nNoncurrent \n\n4,161 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,028 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n13,423 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,880 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially reduced by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process.

A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in &#8220;Inventory Supply Chain.&#8221; As of July 27, 2013 , the liability for these purchase commitments was $172 million &#32;and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations &#32; Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. \n\nLong-Term Debt &#32; The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities &#32; Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,748 million &#32;&#32;and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $399 million &#32;were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nOther Commitments \n\nIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $263 million &#32;as of July 27, 2013 , compared with $120 million &#32;as of July 28, 2012 . \n\nInsieme Networks, Inc. &#32;&#32; In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment includes $100 million &#32;of funding and a license to certain of our technology. In addition, pursuant to a November 2012 amendment to the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, we agreed to invest an additional $35 million &#32;in Insieme upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of July 27, 2013 , we owned approximately 84% &#32;of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn connection with this investment, we have entered into a put/call option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. If we acquire the remaining interests of Insieme, the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based on revenue for certain of Insieme&#8217;s products. We will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned, which may occur in the first half of fiscal 2014. When such a determination is made, the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned, pursuant to a vesting schedule. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense. The maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $863 million . This amount was increased from a previous maximum of $750 million as a result of the November 2012 amendment, as the parties recognized that higher staffing levels may be necessary to perform additional product development. The milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2013 &#32;there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. \n\nVCE is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with EMC Corporation (&#8220;EMC&#8221;), with investments from VMware, Inc. (&#8220;VMware&#8221;) and Intel Corporation. VCE helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware to enable the transformation to cloud computing. As of July 27, 2013 , our cumulative gross investment in VCE was approximately $507 million , inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35% . During fiscal 2013, we invested approximately $93 million &#32;in VCE. We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method, and our portion of VCE&#8217;s net loss is recognized in other income (loss), net. As of July 27, 2013 , we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from VCE of $422 million . Our carrying value in VCE as of July 27, 2013 &#32;was $85 million . Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we expect that we will make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership. \n\nFrom time to time, EMC and Cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of VCE to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. Such guarantees were not material as of July 27, 2013 . \n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. \n\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under &#8220;Financing Receivables and Guarantees.&#8221; \n\nSecurities Lending \n\nWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2013 and 2012 was $0.7 billion &#32;and $0.5 billion , respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 27, 2013 &#32;and July 28, 2012 , we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, pending acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for capital resources. \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 144, "Negative": 419, "Polarity": -0.48845470605958313, "Subjectivity": 0.05799938188338319}, "similarity_score": 0.8797152585855449, "nlp_result": -0.04791165913912848}
