" ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") is intended to help the reader understand The Coca-Cola Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to &#8212; and should be read in conjunction with &#8212; our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&#38;A, which includes the following sections: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOur Business &#8212; a general description of our business and the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#8212; a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperations Review &#8212; an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. Except to the extent that differences among our operating segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion in the MD&#38;A on a consolidated basis. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; an analysis of cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations; foreign exchange; the impact of inflation and changing prices; and an overview of financial position. \n\n##TABLE_END 29 \n\nOur Business \n\nGeneral \n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. \n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers &#8212; the world's largest beverage distribution system. Of the approximately 57 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day, beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for more than 1.8 billion servings. \n\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. \n\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets &#8212; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#8212; to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. \n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nbeverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate business\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfinished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product operations\"). \n\n##TABLE_END Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. \n\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us &#8212; such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles &#8212; and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\nOur finished product operations consist primarily of the production, sales and distribution operations managed by CCR and our Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations. CCR is included in our North America operating segment, and our Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n2011 \n\nConcentrate operations 1 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nFinished product operations 2.3 \n\n61 \n\nNet operating revenues \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 &#160; \n\nIncludes net operating revenues related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business for the full year in 2012 and 2011. In 2010, the percentage includes net operating revenues from the date of the CCE acquisition on October 2, 2010. \n\n##TABLE_END The following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n2011 \n\nConcentrate operations 1 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nFinished product operations 2,3 \n\n30 \n\nTotal worldwide unit case volume \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business for the full year in 2012 and 2011. In 2010, the percentage includes unit case volume from the date of the CCE acquisition on October 2, 2010. \n\n##TABLE_END Acquisition of CCE's Former North America Business and Related Transactions \n\nPursuant to the terms of the business separation and merger agreement entered into on February 25, 2010, as amended (the \"merger agreement\"), on October 2, 2010 (the \"acquisition date\"), we acquired CCE's former North America business, consisting of CCE's production, sales and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and a substantial majority of CCE's corporate segment. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. \n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCE's former North America business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Company's 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCE's corporate operations and former North America business. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as \"New CCE\") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. \n\nAs of October 1, 2010, our Company owned 33 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. Based on the closing price of CCE's common stock on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition date, the fair value of our investment in CCE was $5,373 million, which reflected the fair value of our ownership in both CCE's European operations and its former North America business. We remeasured our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon the close of the transaction. As a result, we recognized a gain of $4,978 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. The gain included a $137 million reclassification adjustment related to foreign currency translation gains recognized upon the disposal of our indirect investment in CCE's European operations. The Company relinquished its indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations to New CCE as part of the consideration to acquire the 67 percent of CCE's former North America business that was not already owned by the Company. \n\nAlthough the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was $1.4 billion, which included $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. \n\nIn contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the United States, Canada Dry in the Northeastern United States, and Canada Dry and C' Plus in Canada, and we made a net one-time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20-year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca-Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for $0.9 billion in cash. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of CCE's former North America business, we granted to New CCE the right to negotiate the acquisition of our majority interest in our German bottler at any time from 18 to 39 months after February 25, 2010, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. \n\nThe Nonalcoholic Beverage Segment of the Commercial Beverage Industry \n\nWe operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. \n\nOur Objective \n\nOur objective is to use our formidable assets &#8212; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#8212; to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPeople: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPortfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people's desires and needs. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPartners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPlanet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProfit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProductivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. \n\n##TABLE_END Strategic Priorities \n\nWe have four strategic priorities designed to create long-term sustainable growth for our Company and the Coca-Cola system and value for our shareowners. These strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership; accelerating innovation; leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio; and leading the Coca-Cola system for growth. To enable the entire Coca-Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; franchise leadership; and bottling and distribution operations. \n\nCore Capabilities \n\nConsumer Marketing \n\nMarketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of, and increase consumer preference for, our brands. This produces long-term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions. \n\nWe have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. \n\nWe are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment. \n\nCommercial Leadership \n\nThe Coca-Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customer's business and needs &#8212; whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. \n\nFranchise Leadership \n\nWe must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Company's success. We work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. Our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca-Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. \n\nBottling and Distribution Operations \n\nMost of our Company beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independent bottling partners. However, over the past several years the amount of Company beverage products that are manufactured, sold and distributed by consolidated bottling and distribution operations has increased. We often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. \n\nOur Company has a long history of providing world-class customer service, demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce. In addition, we have an experienced bottler management team. All of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations. \n\nThe Company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business. This includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers. As we further transform the way we go to market, the Company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient. \n\nChallenges and Risks \n\nBeing global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our Company. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below. \n\nObesity and Inactive Lifestyles \n\nIncreasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry. We recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem and are committed to being a part of the solution. This commitment is reflected through our broad portfolio, with a beverage to suit every caloric and hydration need. \n\nAll of our beverages can be consumed as part of a balanced diet. Consumers who want to reduce the calories they consume from beverages can choose from our continuously expanding portfolio of more than 800 low- and no-calorie beverages, nearly 25 percent of our global portfolio, as well as our regular beverages in smaller portion sizes. We believe in the importance and power of &#8220;informed choice,&#8221; and we continue to support the fact-based nutrition labeling and education initiatives that encourage people to live active, healthy lifestyles. Our commitment also includes creating and adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace; supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education; and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. We recognize the health of our business is interwoven with the well-being of our consumers, our employees and the communities we serve, and we are working in cooperation with governments, educators and consumers. \n\nWater Quality and Quantity \n\nWater quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Company's attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products and is needed to produce the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Today, water is a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, flourishing food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. \n\nOur Company has a robust water stewardship and management program and continues to work to improve water use efficiency, treat wastewater prior to discharge and to achieve our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We regularly assess the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are actively collaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world. We are working with our global partners to develop sustainability-related water projects. We are encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system. Through these integrated programs, we believe that our Company is in an excellent position to leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve &#8212; through source water availability assessments, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems, and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial to the successful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource. \n\nEvolving Consumer Preferences \n\nConsumers want more choices. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products, innovative packaging, and ingredient and packaging material education efforts. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs, desires and lifestyle choices. \n\nIncreased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace \n\nOur Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. \n\nFood Security \n\nIncreased demand for commodities and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. We are committed to implementing programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability designed to help address these agricultural challenges. Through joint efforts with farmers, communities, bottlers, suppliers and key partners, as well as our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, we can together help make a strategic impact on food security. \n\nAll of these challenges and risks &#8212; obesity and inactive lifestyles, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences, increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace, and food security &#8212; have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. \n\nSee also ''Item 1A. Risk Factors'' in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRecoverability of Noncurrent Assets \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n##TABLE_END Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 1,776 million &#32;and $ 1,183 million &#32;as of December 31, 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively, \n\nrepresenting our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 234 million &#32;and $ 199 million &#32;as of December 31, 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. \n\nPurchase Accounting for Acquisitions \n\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination. In general, this methodology requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. We estimate fair value using the exit price approach, which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets. Management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Company's results of operations. \n\nTransaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in the Company's consolidated statements of income. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, the Company acquired CCE's former North America business and recorded total assets of $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. The assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that were subject to the significant estimates described above. During our purchase accounting measurement period, which concluded during the third quarter of 2011, the Company made adjustments to certain amounts that resulted in a final balance of $22.0 billion of total assets being recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to the CCE acquisition. Refer to the heading \"Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets\" below and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to this acquisition. \n\nRecoverability of Noncurrent Assets \n\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. \n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statements of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. \n\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. \n\nCertain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. \n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging markets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#8212; Challenges and Risks\" above and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. \n\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities \n\nThe carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value, if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. \n\nThe following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2012 \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage \n\nof Total \n\nAssets \n\nEquity method investments \n\n$ \n\n9,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSecurities classified as available-for-sale \n\n4,593 \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurities classified as trading \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nCost method investments \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n14,220 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nAccounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in developing and emerging markets, may impact the determination of fair value. \n\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects \n\nof the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nIn 2012, the Company recognized impairment charges of $16 million as a result of the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values of certain cost method investments. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below as well as Note 16 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2011, the Company recognized impairment charges of $17 million as a result of the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values of certain available-for-sale securities. In addition, the Company recognized charges of $41 million during 2011 related to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below as well as Note 16 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2010, the Company recognized impairment charges of $41 million as a result of the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values of certain available-for-sale securities and an equity method investment. These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Bottling Investments and Corporate operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below as well as Note 16 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2012 \n\nFair \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nDifference \n\nCoca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. \n\n$ \n\n8,601 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,074 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,527 \n\nCoca-Cola Amatil Limited \n\n3,133 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,125 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,008 \n\nCoca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. \n\n1,865 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,368 \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola &#304;&#231;ecek A.&#350;. \n\n1,055 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmbotelladora Andina S.A. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola Central Japan Co., Ltd. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n15,900 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,536 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,364 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOther Assets \n\nOur Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets (or asset groups) may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. \n\nAs a result of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business, the Company recorded charges of $266 million related to preexisting relationships during the year ended December 31, 2010. These charges were primarily related to the write-off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. Our investment in these infrastructure programs with CCE did not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset subsequent to the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 &#32;and Note 6 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was $ 14,476 million , or 17 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment review is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2012 \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage \n\nof Total \n\nAssets \n\nGoodwill \n\n$ \n\n12,255 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives \n\n7,405 \n\n&#160; \n\nTrademarks with indefinite lives \n\n6,527 \n\n&#160; \n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, net \n\n1,039 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther intangible assets not subject to amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n27,337 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nAccounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. \n\n##TABLE_END When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group), we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \n\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, prior to completing the impairment test described above. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment. During 2012 , the Company only performed qualitative assessments on less than 10 percent &#32;of our indefinite-lived intangible assets balance. \n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as \"business units.\" These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. \n\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to completing the two-step process described above to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step process. Otherwise, the Company will forego the two-step process and does not need to perform any further testing. During 2012 , the Company only performed qualitative assessments on less than 10 percent &#32;of our consolidated goodwill balance. \n\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. \n\nAs of our most recent annual impairment review, the Company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets, individually or in the aggregate. In addition, as of December 31, 2012 , we did not have any reporting unit with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that it will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. However, if macroeconomic conditions worsen, it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets, which would require us to recognize impairment charges. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods. \n\nWe acquired CCE's former North America business on October 2, 2010, which resulted in the Company recording $14,327 million of intangible assets, including goodwill. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquired intangible assets included $5,850 million of bottler franchise rights, which consisted of $5,200 million of franchise rights with indefinite lives and $650 million of franchise rights with definite lives. The franchise rights with indefinite lives represent franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute certain beverages in specified territories. The franchise rights with definite lives relate to franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive rights to manufacture and/or distribute certain beverages in specified territories for a finite period of time and, therefore, have been classified as definite-lived intangible assets. \n\nThe Company recorded $8,050 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition that was assigned to the North America operating segment, of which $170 million has been, and will continue to be, amortized for tax purposes. This goodwill is primarily related to synergistic value created from having a unified operating system that will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\nOur Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. \n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation. \n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2012 &#32;and 2011 , the weighted-average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was 4.00 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively. \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long-term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our net periodic benefit cost was 8.25 percent in 2012 and 2011. \n\nIn 2012 , the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $251 million. In 2013, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $191 million. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to approximately $640 million of contributions the Company expects to make to various plans in 2013 as well as the impact of favorable returns on plan assets in 2012. The favorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligation. The estimated impact of an additional 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2013 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $47 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on our 2013 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $29 million. \n\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company's primary U.S. plan represented 59 percent and 64 percent of the Company's consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. \n\nOur customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $ 6.1 billion , $ 5.8 billion &#32;and $ 5.0 billion &#32;in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Income Taxes\" below and Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. \n\nTax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. \n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $ 487 million &#32;and primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. As of December 31, 2012 , undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $ 26.9 billion . Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24.0 percent in 2013. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2013. \n\nRecent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements \n\nRefer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. \n\nOperations Review \n\nOur organizational structure as of December 31, 2012 , consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as \"operating groups\" or \"groups\": Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements \n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance. \n\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\nOur Bottling Investments operating segment and our other finished product operations, including the finished product operations in our North America operating segment, typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these consolidated finished product operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations, and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\n\"Structural changes\" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. \n\nThe Company acquired Great Plains Coca-Cola Bottling Company (\"Great Plains\") in December 2011, bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia in February 2012, and bottling operations in Guatemala in June 2012. Accordingly, the impact to net operating revenues related to these acquisitions was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nIn January 2012, the Company announced that BPW, our joint venture with Nestl&#233; in the ready-to-drink tea category, will focus its geographic scope primarily on Europe and Canada. The joint venture was phased out in all other territories by the end of 2012, and the Company's agreement to distribute products in the United States under a sublicense from a subsidiary of Nestl&#233; terminated at the end of 2012. The impact to net operating revenues for North America related to the termination of our license agreement has been included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. In addition, we have eliminated the BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed unit case volume and associated concentrate sales for the year ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , in those countries impacted by these structural changes. We have also eliminated the BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed unit case volume and associated concentrate sales from the base year, where applicable, when calculating 2012 versus 2011 volume growth rates. Refer to the headings \"Beverage Volume\" and \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nThe Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. \n\n\"Acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. \n\nIn 2012, the Company invested in the existing beverage business of Aujan, one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East. Under our definitive agreement with Aujan, the Company now owns 50 percent of the Aujan entity that holds the rights to Aujan-owned brands in certain territories and 49 percent of Aujan's bottling and distribution operations in certain territories. Accordingly, the volume associated with the Aujan transaction, subsequent to our initial equity investment during the second quarter of 2012, is considered to be from acquired brands. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\n\"License agreements\" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, in legally separate transactions, we acquired CCE's former North America business and entered into a license agreement with DPS. We also sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Although each of these items does not have an impact on the comparability of the Company's 2012 and 2011 consolidated financial statements, the sections below are intended to provide an overview of the impact these items had on the comparability of our 2011 and 2010 consolidated financial statements. \n\nAcquisition of CCE's Former North America Business and the DPS License Agreements \n\nImmediately prior to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business on October 2, 2010, the Company owned 33 percent of CCE's outstanding common stock. This ownership represented our indirect ownership interest in both CCE's former North America business and its European operations. On October 2, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining 67 percent of CCE's former North America business not already owned by the Company for consideration that included the Company's indirect ownership interest in CCE's European operations. As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100 percent of CCE's former North America business and does not own any interest in New CCE's European operations. The operating results of CCE's former North America business were included in our consolidated financial statements starting October 2, 2010. The operating results of New CCE do not directly impact the Company's consolidated financial statements, since we have no ownership interest in this entity. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#8212; General\" above and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the acquisition. \n\nOn October 2, 2010, the Company also entered into an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where these brands were distributed by CCE prior to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the acquisition. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#8212; General\" above and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these new license agreements. \n\nPrior to the acquisition and entering into the DPS license agreements, the Company's North America operating segment was predominantly a concentrate operation. As a result of the acquisition and the DPS license agreements, the North America operating segment is now predominantly a finished product operation. Generally, finished product operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins compared to concentrate operations. Refer to \"Item 1. Business &#8212; Products and Brands\" for additional discussion of the differences between the Company's concentrate operations and our finished product operations. These transactions resulted in higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins for the North America operating segment and our consolidated operating results. \n\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company reported unit case volume for the sale of Company beverage products sold by CCE. After the transaction closing, we report unit case volume of Company beverage products just as we had prior to the transaction. \n\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company recognized concentrate sales volume at the time we sold the concentrate to CCE. Upon the closing of the transaction, we do not recognize the concentrate sales volume until CCR has sold finished products manufactured from concentrate to a customer. \n\nThe DPS license agreements impact both the Company's unit case and concentrate sales volumes. Sales made pursuant to these license agreements represent acquired volume and are incremental unit case volume and concentrate sales volume to the Company only during the 12-month period following the acquisition. Prior to entering into the license agreements, the Company did not include the DPS brands as unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as these brands were not Company beverage products. Refer to the heading \"Unit Case Volume\" below for additional information. \n\nPrior to the acquisition, we recognized the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company does not recognize the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sold to CCE's former North America business until the finished products manufactured from those concentrates are sold. For example, in 2010, most of our pre-Easter concentrate sales to CCE impacted our first quarter operating results. In 2011, our Easter-related finished product sales had a greater impact on our second quarter operating results. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not have an indirect ownership interest in New CCE's European operations. Therefore, we are no longer required to defer the portion of revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales to New CCE. \n\nThe acquisition of CCE's former North America business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. The following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\"). The majority of these costs are included within our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. The Company increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. Refer to the heading \"Gross Profit Margin\" below and Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity. \n\nIn 2010, the gross profit for our North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the acquisition. Refer to the headings \"Gross Profit Margin\" and \"Operating Income and Operating Margin\" below. \n\nThe acquisition of CCE's former North America business increased the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to delivery-related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are typically higher, as a percentage of net operating revenues, for finished product operations compared to concentrate operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition. The Company recorded $650 million of definite-lived acquired franchise rights that are being amortized over a weighted-average life of approximately eight years from the date of acquisition, which is equal to the weighted-average remaining contractual term of the acquired franchise rights. In addition, the Company recorded $380 million of customer rights that are being amortized over 20 years. We estimate the amortization expense related to these definite-lived intangible assets to be approximately $100 million per year for the next several years, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nIn connection with the Company's acquisition of CCE's former North America business, we assumed $7,602 million of long-term debt, which had an estimated fair value of $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Cash Flows from Financing Activities &#8212; Debt Financing\" below and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2010, the Company recognized a gain of $4,978 million due to the remeasurement of our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon the close of the transaction. This gain was classified in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nPrior to the closing of this acquisition, we had accounted for our investment in CCE under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded our proportionate share of CCE's net income or loss in the line item equity income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statements of income. However, as a result of this transaction, beginning October 2, 2010, the Company no longer records equity income or loss related to CCE, and therefore, this transaction negatively impacted the amount of equity income the Company recorded during both 2011 and 2010. Refer to the heading \"Equity Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" below. \n\nDivestiture of Norwegian and Swedish Bottling Operations \n\nThe divestiture of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations had no impact on our consolidated unit case volume and consolidated concentrate sales volume, for the same reasons discussed above in relation to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The divestiture of these bottling operations reduced unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment. In addition, the divestiture reduced net operating revenues and net income for our consolidated operating results and the Bottling Investments operating segment. However, since we divested a finished product business, it had a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating margins. Furthermore, the impact these divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues was partially offset by the concentrate revenues that were recognized on sales to these bottling operations. These concentrate sales had previously been eliminated because they were intercompany transactions. The net impact to net operating revenues was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nThis divestiture resulted in a gain of $597 million in 2010, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. In 2011, the Company recorded charges of $5 million related to the finalization of working capital adjustments in connection with the divestiture of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations. These charges reduced the transaction gain the Company previously reported in 2010. \n\nBeverage Volume \n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures, in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. \n\nInformation about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPercent Change &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 vs. 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 vs. 2010 \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\nUnit Cases 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\nConcentrate \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nUnit Cases 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\nConcentrate \n\nSales \n\nWorldwide \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottling Investments \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nBottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nGeographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. \n\n##TABLE_END Unit Case Volume \n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold approximately 27.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2012 , approximately 26.7 billion unit cases in 2011 &#32;and approximately 25.5 billion unit cases in 2010 . The number of unit cases sold in 2012 does not include BPW unit case volume for those countries in which BPW was phased out in 2012, nor does it include unit case volume of products distributed in the United States under a sublicense from a subsidiary of Nestl&#233; which terminated at the end of 2012. In addition, the Company eliminated BPW and Nestl&#233; licensed unit case volume from the base year, where applicable, when calculating 2012 versus 2011 volume growth rates below.

The group's sparkling beverage growth was led by 10 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 11 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 6 percent growth in Trademark Fanta. Growth in still beverages was primarily due to juices and juice drinks and included an 8 percentage point benefit attributable to acquired volume, primarily related to our investments in Aujan. India reported 16 percent unit case volume growth, reflecting the impact of strong integrated marketing campaigns and primarily consisted of 33 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 20 percent growth in Trademark Sprite, 13 percent growth in Trademark Thums Up and 26 percent growth in our Maaza juice drink brand. In addition, Russia reported unit case volume growth of 8 percent, driven by growth of 20 percent in brand Coca-Cola. Still beverage growth in Russia included growth of 13 percent and 23 percent in our juice brands Dobriy and Rich, respectively. Eurasia and Africa also benefited from unit case volume growth of 21 percent in the Company's Middle East and North Africa business unit, including a 9 percentage point benefit attributable to acquired volume, primarily related to our investments in Aujan. South Africa had unit case volume growth of 6 percent, reflecting our increased marketing initiatives in the current year and the impact of the volume decline reported in 2011 due to unfavorable weather conditions and higher pricing. \n\nUnit case volume in Europe declined 1 percent, which consisted of a 2 percent decline in sparkling beverages and minimal growth in still beverages. Germany reported unit case volume growth of 1 percent, reflecting the Company's strong commercial campaigns such as our 2012 Olympic Games partnership and the Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour, music-themed integrated marketing campaigns and a continued focus on low-calorie and no-calorie sparkling beverages. The favorable impact of growth in Germany was more than offset by volume declines in other markets. The group reported a decline in unit case volume of 3 percent in the Northwest Europe and Nordics business unit and a volume decline of 1 percent in the Iberia business unit, reflecting the challenges of continued weak consumer confidence, adverse weather and aggressive competitive pricing. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 12 percent growth in still beverages. The growth reported across Latin America was driven by continued investments in our brands, strong activation of holiday programming, and a continued focus on a differentiated occasion-based package, price and channel strategy. The group's growth in sparkling beverages was led by 3 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 6 percent growth in Trademark Fanta and 5 percent growth in Trademark Sprite. Still beverage growth in Latin America reflected 34 percent growth in ready-to-drink teas as a result of the newly launched Fuze Tea, 28 percent growth in sports drinks, 9 percent growth in packaged water and 12 percent growth in juices and juice drinks. Brazil reported unit case volume growth of 6 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola, 11 percent growth in Trademark Fanta and 16 percent growth in still beverages. Latin America also benefited from unit case volume growth of 4 percent in Mexico and 7 percent growth in Argentina. \n\nUnit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, led by growth of 8 percent in still beverages. Still beverage growth in North America included 16 percent growth in ready-to-drink teas, 12 percent growth in sports drinks, 9 percent growth in packaged water and 2 percent growth in juices and juice drinks. The group reported 11 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, reflecting the benefit of a strong 2012 Olympic Games activation. Growth in ready-to-drink teas included the continued strong growth of Gold Peak, and the group's juices and juice drinks benefited from 7 percent growth in Trademark Simply. Dasani had unit case volume growth of 10 percent and maintained its premium pricing position, supported by our PlantBottle PET packaging. The group's growth in still beverages was partially offset by a volume decline of 1 percent in sparkling beverages. Although overall sparkling beverage volume declined in North America, the group benefited from growth in Coca-Cola Zero and Trademark Fanta of 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively. \n\nIn Pacific, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 8 percent growth in still beverages. The group's volume results included 4 percent growth in China, despite the impact of an economic slowdown in the country, extremely wet weather in July and August and the shift in timing of the 2013 Chinese New Year. Sparkling beverage growth in China was led by growth of 21 percent in Trademark Fanta. Still beverage growth in China was primarily due to volume growth in packaged water. Japan's unit case volume increased 2 percent, which included a 3 percent increase in still beverages, partially offset by a 2 percent decline in sparkling beverages. Still beverages in Japan benefited primarily from growth in the Company's ready-to-drink tea and coffee categories. The Pacific group also benefited from unit case volume growth of 22 percent in Thailand, 20 percent in South Korea and 5 percent in the Philippines. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 10 percent. The group had growth in key markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations, including unit case volume growth of 4 percent in China, 16 percent in India, 5 percent in the Philippines and 1 percent in Germany. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 34 percent, 65 percent, 100 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India, the Philippines and Germany, respectively. The group's volume growth included a benefit of 3 percentage points attributable to the acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala during the year ended December 31, 2012. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2010 &#32; \n\nIn Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 5 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 13 percent growth in still beverages. The group's unit case volume growth was largely due to growth in our key markets, including India and Turkey. India experienced 12 percent unit case volume growth, which consisted of 12 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 11 percent growth in still beverages. India's growth in sparkling beverages was primarily due to 17 percent growth in Trademark Sprite, 15 percent growth in Trademark Thums Up and 11 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. Still beverages in India benefited from 14 percent growth in our Kinley water brand and 11 percent growth in Maaza, a component of our juice portfolio in India. The group also benefited from unit case volume growth of 10 percent in Turkey, which included strong growth in brand Coca-Cola. Unit case volume grew 5 percent in Russia, primarily due to our acquisition of OAO Nidan Juices (\"Nidan\") in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of the acquired Nidan juice, Russia's overall unit case volume declined 2 percent in 2011. Eurasia and Africa also benefited from unit case volume growth of 8 percent in the Company's Middle East and North Africa business unit despite ongoing geopolitical challenges in the region. The group's unit case volume growth in the markets described above was partially offset by a 2 percent unit case volume decline in South Africa. This decline was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions during our peak summer selling season as well as higher pricing in the marketplace. \n\nUnit case volume in Europe increased 2 percent, despite an unseasonably cold and rainy summer selling season and moderate consumer confidence. The Company achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market with consideration for the current economic environment. The group benefited from the Company's successful launch of our 125 th anniversary marketing campaign as well as other integrated marketing campaigns. The group had 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages, including 3 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and growth of 14 percent in Coca-Cola Zero. Unit case volume for still beverages increased 2 percent, led by growth in energy drinks and tea. Germany's unit case volume increased 6 percent, primarily attributable to 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 13 percent growth in Trademark Fanta. Our German business continued to benefit from the Company's bottler restructuring efforts and our effective marketing campaigns. In addition, France and Great Britain had growth of 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, each led by growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 15 percent growth in still beverages. The group's sparkling beverage unit case volume growth was led by 4 percent growth in brand Coca-Cola. Still beverages benefited from the successful performance of Del Valle as well as strong growth in other still beverages, including water and tea. Mexico had unit case volume growth of 9 percent, led by 7 percent growth in sparkling beverages, which included 7 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. In addition, Argentina had 10 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola which contributed to its overall unit case volume growth of 10 percent. Argentina's unit case volume growth benefited from strong integrated marketing campaigns, including sponsorship of the Copa America soccer tournament in July. Brazil's unit case volume increased 1 percent despite a general slowdown in the country's economy. The group's unit case volume growth in the markets described above was partially offset by a 10 percent volume decline in Venezuela. The decline in Venezuela is a reflection of the continued economic and political pressures affecting the country. \n\nUnit case volume in North America increased 4 percent, including 3 percent growth attributable to the new license agreements with DPS. The group's unit case volume growth was driven by 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages, primarily due to the sale of Dr Pepper brands under the new license agreements. Coca-Cola Zero continued its strong performance in North America with 11 percent unit case volume growth. Unit case volume for still beverages in North America increased 4 percent, including 12 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, 10 percent growth in Trademark Dasani and 48 percent growth in Gold Peak. The growth in still beverages in North America was partially offset by a decline of 2 percent in juice and juice drinks, a reflection of increased pricing to offset commodity costs. In December 2011, the Company acquired Great Plains in the United States. As a result of this acquisition, we report volume from cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr Pepper, that were previously distributed by Great Plains. Unit case volume for these cross-licensed brands was 12 million unit cases for full year 2011. The Company began reporting unit case volume for these cross-licensed brands in December 2011. \n\nIn Pacific, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 8 percent growth in still beverages. The group's volume growth was led by 13 percent growth in China, which included 12 percent growth in sparkling beverages attributable to strong growth in Trademark Sprite, Coca-Cola and Fanta. The group also benefited from China's 16 percent growth in still beverages, including strong growth in Minute Maid Pulpy and other still beverages, including water. In Japan, unit case volume growth was even, reflecting the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northern and eastern portions of the country on March 11, 2011. The group's unit case volume growth in the markets described above was partially offset by a 9 percent volume decline in the Philippines. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments was even when compared to the prior year. The group had growth in key markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations, including unit case volume growth of 13 percent in China, 12 percent in India and 6 percent in Germany. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 34 percent, 66 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and Germany, respectively. However, growth in these markets was offset by the unfavorable impact of the Company's sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE during the fourth quarter of 2010 as well as a unit case volume decline of 9 percent in the Philippines where we own 100 percent of the country's bottling operations. \n\nConcentrate Sales Volume \n\nIn 2012 , concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 4 percent compared to 2011 . Likewise, in 2011 , concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2010 . The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for individual operating segments in 2012 &#32;and 2011 &#32;were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. \n\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent Change &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 vs. 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 vs. 2010 \n\n(In millions except percentages and per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs Adjusted 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNET OPERATING REVENUES \n\n$ \n\n48,017 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n46,542 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,119 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nCost of goods sold \n\n19,053 \n\n&#160; \n\n18,215 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,693 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGROSS PROFIT \n\n28,964 \n\n&#160; \n\n28,327 \n\n&#160; \n\n22,426 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGROSS PROFIT MARGIN \n\n60.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n63.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n17,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n17,422 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,194 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther operating charges \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nOPERATING INCOME \n\n10,779 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,173 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,413 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATING MARGIN \n\n22.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(43 \n\n) \n\nEquity income (loss) &#8212; net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,025 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(33 \n\n) \n\nOther income (loss) &#8212; net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,185 \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES \n\n11,809 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,458 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,207 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n) \n\nIncome taxes \n\n2,723 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,812 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,370 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n23.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n16.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCONSOLIDATED NET INCOME \n\n9,086 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,646 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,837 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n) \n\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREOWNERS OF \n\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY \n\n$ \n\n9,019 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,584 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,787 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n)% \n\nBASIC NET INCOME PER SHARE 3 \n\n$ \n\n2.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.88 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.55 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(26 \n\n)% \n\nDILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE 3 \n\n$ \n\n1.97 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.85 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.53 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nCalculation is not meaningful. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nEffective January 1, 2012, the Company elected to change our accounting methodology for determining the market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.

The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, British pound, South African rand and Australian dollar, which impacted the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on our Pacific operating segment.

Also, still beverages grew faster than sparkling beverages in Latin America, bolstered by the strong performance of Del Valle; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPacific was unfavorably impacted by geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets. The revenue per unit sold in those markets is generally less than in developed markets; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPacific was unfavorably impacted by channel and product mix due to the earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern and eastern Japan on March 11, 2011; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nBottling Investments was favorably impacted by price mix as a result of pricing increases in a number of key markets, including China, India and Latin America. \n\n##TABLE_END 52 \n\nThe favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations increased net operating revenues for our international and Bottling Investments operating segments by 4 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, British pound, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nNet Operating Revenues by Operating Segment \n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n5.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.9 \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n9.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.6 \n\nLatin America \n\n9.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n9.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.0 \n\nNorth America \n\n45.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n44.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n31.7 \n\nPacific \n\n11.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.1 \n\nBottling Investments \n\n18.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n18.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n23.4 \n\nCorporate \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations. In 2012, the percentage contribution of each operating segment did not change significantly when compared to 2011. In 2011, the percentage of the Company's net operating revenues contributed by our North America operating segment increased 12.5 percentage points when compared to 2010 as a result of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business on October 2, 2010. The CCE acquisition resulted in a decrease in the proportionate share of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues contributed by our operating segments outside of North America for both 2011 and 2010. In addition, the percentage of the Company's net operating revenues contributed by our Bottling Investments operating segment decreased 5.1 percentage points in 2011 when compared to 2010, primarily due to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and the segment's proportionate decrease in the Company's consolidated net operating revenues due to the CCE acquisition in North America. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above. \n\nThe size and timing of structural changes are not consistent from period to period. As a result, anticipating the impact of such events on future net operating revenues, and other financial statement line items, usually is not possible. We expect structural changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. \n\nGross Profit Margin \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 \n\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 60.3 percent in 2012 from 60.9 percent in 2011. This decrease reflected the unfavorable impact of continued increases in commodity costs during 2012 as well as temporary shifts in channel and package mix across markets as a result of the impact of current global economic conditions on consumers. In addition, our gross profit margin was unfavorably impacted as a result of ongoing fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of our acquisition of Great Plains in North America as well as our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable geographic mix as well as price increases in many of our key markets. \n\nThe following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The majority of these costs are included in our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. The cost to purchase these inputs continued to increase in 2012 when compared to 2011, and as a result the Company incurred incremental costs of $225 million related to these inputs during 2012. The Company anticipates that the cost of underlying commodities will continue to face upward pressure in 2013. We currently expect the incremental impact of increased commodity costs related to these inputs, after considering our hedge positions, to be approximately $100 million on our full year 2013 consolidated results. \n\nIn recent years, the Company has increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price and foreign currency risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify, or are not designated, for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments has been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded losses of $110 million and $54 million and a gain of $31 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively, in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" above. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2010 \n\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 60.9 percent in 2011 from 63.9 percent in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to the full year impact of consolidating CCE's former North America business as well as a significant increase in commodity costs. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by favorable geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets, favorable product mix, price increases in many of our key markets and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In addition, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations during the fourth quarter of 2010 had a favorable impact on our full year 2011 gross profit margin. \n\nThe Company's acquisition of CCE's former North America business during the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. Finished product operations typically have lower gross profit margins and greater exposure to fluctuations in the cost of raw materials when compared to concentrate operations. The following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The majority of these costs are included in our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. The cost to purchase these inputs increased significantly in 2011 when compared to 2010, and as a result the Company incurred incremental costs of $800 million related to these inputs during 2011. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs Adjusted \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nAdvertising expenses \n\n3,342 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,917 \n\nBottling and distribution expenses \n\n8,905 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,502 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,902 \n\nOther operating expenses \n\n5,232 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,995 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n$ \n\n17,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,422 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,194 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $316 million, or 2 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3 percent. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense in 2012 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive compensation programs. As a result of the Company's revised outlook of the unfavorable impact foreign currency fluctuations are projected to have on certain performance periods, the Company lowered the estimated payouts associated with these periods. Advertising expenses increased during the year and reflect the Company's continued investment in the health and strength of our brands and building market execution capabilities while simultaneously capturing incremental marketing efficiencies. The increase in bottling and distribution expenses includes the full year impact of the Company's acquisition of Great Plains in December 2011 as well as our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala during 2012. Other operating expenses decreased during the year, partially reflecting the impact of the Company's productivity and integration initiatives. \n\nIn 2013, our pension expense is expected to decrease by approximately $60 million compared to 2012. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to approximately $640 million of contributions the Company expects to make to various plans in 2013, as well as favorable returns on plan assets in 2012. The favorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligation. Refer to the \n\nheading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\" below for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#8212; Pension Plan Valuations\" above and Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the discount rates used by the Company. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , we had $ 467 million &#32;of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2010 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $4,228 million, or 32 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3 percent. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily related to the impact of modifications made to certain replacement performance share unit awards on our prior year results, partially offset by higher estimated payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long-term incentive compensation programs. Advertising expenses increased during the year and reflect the Company's continued investment in the health and strength of our brands and building market execution capabilities. The increase in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily due to the full year impact of consolidating CCE's former North America business in addition to our continued investments in our other bottling operations around the world. This increase was partially offset by the full year impact of the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE during the fourth quarter of 2010. Other operating expenses decreased during the year, partially reflecting the impact of the Company's productivity and integration initiatives. \n\nOther Operating Charges \n\nOther operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nEurope \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottling Investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2012, the Company incurred other operating charges of $ 447 million , which primarily consisted of $ 270 million &#32;associated with the Company's productivity and reinvestment program; $ 163 million &#32;related to the Company's other restructuring and integration initiatives; $ 20 million &#32;due to changes in the Company's ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our U.S. license agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012; and $ 8 million &#32;due to costs associated with the Company detecting carbendazim in orange juice imported from Brazil for distribution in the United States. These charges were partially offset by reversals of $ 10 million &#32;associated with the refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's 2008&#8211;2011 productivity initiatives, as well as reversals of $ 6 million &#32;associated with the refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's integration of CCE's former North America business. Refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and see below for further information on the Company's productivity and reinvestment program, as well as the Company's other productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. \n\nIn 2011, the Company incurred other operating charges of $ 732 million , which primarily consisted of $ 633 million &#32;associated with the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives; $ 50 million &#32;related to the events in Japan; $ 35 million &#32;of costs associated with the merger of Embotelladoras Arca, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Arca\") and Grupo Continental S.A.B. (\"Contal\"); and $ 10 million &#32;associated with the floods in Thailand that impacted the Company's supply chain operations in the region. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the merger of Arca and Contal. Refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and see below for additional information on the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. \n\nIn 2010, the Company incurred other operating charges of $819 million, which consisted of $478 million associated with the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives; $250 million related to charitable contributions; $81 million due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE; and $10 million of charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. The Company's integration activities included costs associated with the integration of CCE's former North America business, as well as the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The charitable contributions were primarily attributable to a cash donation to The Coca-Cola Foundation. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction costs. Refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and see below for additional information on the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. \n\nProductivity and Reinvestment Program \n\nIn February 2012, the Company announced a new four-year productivity and reinvestment program. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth. The first component of this program is a new global productivity initiative that will target annualized savings of $350 million to $400 million. This initiative will be focused on four primary areas: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; and data and information technology (\"IT\") systems standardization. The Company is in the process of defining the costs associated with this initiative. \n\nThe second component of our new productivity and reinvestment program involves beginning a new integration initiative in North America related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The Company has identified incremental synergies, primarily in the area of our North American product supply operations, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. We believe these efforts will create annualized savings of $200 million to $250 million. \n\nAs a combined productivity and reinvestment program, the Company anticipates generating annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million, which will be phased in over time. We expect to begin fully realizing the annual benefit of these savings in 2015, the final year of the program. The savings generated by this program will be reinvested in brand-building initiatives, and in the short term will also mitigate potential incremental commodity costs. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nProductivity Initiatives \n\nDuring 2011, the Company successfully completed our four-year global productivity program and exceeded our target of providing $500 million in annualized savings from these initiatives. These savings have provided the Company additional flexibility to invest for growth. The Company generated these savings in a number of areas, which include aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a \"procure-to-pay\" program. In realizing these savings, the Company incurred total costs of $ 498 million &#32;related to these productivity initiatives since they commenced during the first quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIntegration of CCE's Former North America Business \n\nIn 2010, the Company began an integration initiative related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business on October 2, 2010. Upon completion of the CCE transaction, we combined the management of the acquired North America business with the management of our existing foodservice business; Minute Maid and Odwalla juice businesses; North America supply chain operations; and Company-owned bottling operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a unified bottling and customer service organization called CCR. In addition, we reshaped our remaining CCNA operations into an organization that primarily provides franchise leadership and consumer marketing and innovation for the North American market. As a result of the transaction and related reorganization, our North American businesses operate as aligned and agile organizations with distinct capabilities, responsibilities and strengths. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2011, we completed this program. The Company incurred total pretax expenses of $ 487 million &#32;related to this initiative since the plan commenced in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIntegration of Our German Bottling and Distribution Operations \n\nThe Company's integration initiatives include costs related to the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. We incurred expenses of $ 148 million &#32;in 2012 &#32;related to this initiative. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company began these integration initiatives in 2008 and has incurred total pretax expenses of $ 440 million &#32;since they commenced. The Company is currently reviewing other integration and restructuring opportunities within the German bottling and distribution operations, which if implemented will result in additional charges in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2012 , the Company had not finalized any additional plans. Refer to Note 18 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOperating Income and Operating Margin \n\nInformation about our operating income contribution by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n10.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.6 \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n27.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n30.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n35.4 \n\nLatin America \n\n26.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n27.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n28.6 \n\nNorth America \n\n24.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n22.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n18.1 \n\nPacific \n\n22.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n21.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n24.3 \n\nBottling Investments \n\n1.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\nCorporate \n\n(12.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(14.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(20.7 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInformation about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated \n\n22.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 \n\n% \n\nEurasia &#38; Africa \n\n41.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n40.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n40.4 \n\n% \n\nEurope \n\n66.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n64.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n67.3 \n\nLatin America \n\n63.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n63.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.0 \n\nNorth America \n\n12.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n13.6 \n\nPacific \n\n43.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n39.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n41.4 \n\nBottling Investments \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\nCorporate \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * \n\nCalculation is not meaningful. \n\n##TABLE_END As demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by operating segment fluctuated from year to year. Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events, including the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 5 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, British pound, South African rand and Australian dollar, which impacted the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on our Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 11 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 4 percent for Europe, 10 percent for Latin America, 19 percent for Bottling Investments and 1 percent for Corporate. Operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 2 percent for Pacific. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on operating income for North America. \n\n##TABLE_END 57 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Consequently, the shift in our geographic mix is driving favorable product mix from a global perspective. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, our consolidated operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by the reversal of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive compensation programs. As a result of the Company's revised outlook of the unfavorable impact foreign currency fluctuations are projected to have on certain performance periods, the Company lowered the estimated payouts associated with these periods. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income increased for Eurasia and Africa due to volume and revenue growth across the operating segment. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income declined for Europe as a result of lower sales volume and shifts in product, package and channel mix across markets, partially offset by efficient expense management. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income increased for Latin America, reflecting solid volume growth and favorable pricing across the group, partially offset by continued investments in the business, including some initial investments related to the 2014 World Cup. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income increased for North America, primarily due to positive volume growth and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs and ongoing investment in marketplace executional capabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income was reduced by $21 million for North America due to costs associated with the Company detecting residues of carbendazim, a fungicide that is not registered in the United States for use on citrus products, in orange juice imported from Brazil for distribution in the United States. As a result, the Company began purchasing additional supplies of Florida orange juice at a higher cost than Brazilian orange juice. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income was reduced by $20 million for North America due to changes in the Company's ready-to-drink tea strategy as a result of our current U.S. license agreement with Nestl&#233; terminating at the end of 2012. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income was reduced by $1 million for Europe, $227 million for North America, $3 million for Pacific, $164 million for Bottling Investments and $38 million for Corporate due to charges related to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program as well as other restructuring initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income was increased by $4 million for Europe, $1 million for Pacific and $5 million for Corporate due to the refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's 2008&#8211;2011 productivity initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2012, operating income was increased by $6 million for North America due to the refinement of previously established accruals related to the Company's integration of CCE's former North America business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted consolidated operating income by 4 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, British pound, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 2 percent for Europe, 4 percent for Latin America, 1 percent for North America, 7 percent for Pacific, 7 percent for Bottling Investments and 1 percent for Corporate. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 1 percent for Eurasia and Africa. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. \n\n##TABLE_END 58 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income and operating margin for Europe were unfavorably impacted by a change in our concentrate pricing strategy in Germany with our consolidated bottler. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income and operating margin for Latin America were favorably impacted by volume growth across all of the group's business units and pricing increases in key markets, partially offset by continued investments in the business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, the operating margin for North America was unfavorably impacted by the full year impact of the Company's acquisition of CCE's former North America business. Generally, bottling and finished product operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. The impact of this transaction was also reflected in the Company's operating margin. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income and operating margin for North America were unfavorably impacted by higher commodity costs in the segment's finished product businesses. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income was reduced by $19 million for North America due to the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income and operating margin for Pacific and North America were unfavorably impacted as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern and eastern Japan on March 11, 2011. Operating income was reduced by $82 million and $2 million for Pacific and North America, respectively. The charges were primarily related to the Company's charitable donations in support of relief and rebuilding efforts in Japan as well as funds we provided to certain bottling partners in the affected regions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income was reduced by $10 million for Corporate due to charges associated with the floods in Thailand that impacted the Company's supply chain operations in the region. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2011, operating income was reduced by $12 million for Eurasia and Africa, $25 million for Europe, $4 million for Latin America, $374 million for North America, $4 million for Pacific, $89 million for Bottling Investments and $164 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Company&#8217;s productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives as well as costs associated with the merger of Arca and Contal. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted consolidated operating income by 3 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 7 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 3 percent for Latin America, 8 percent for Pacific and 9 percent for Bottling Investments. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 1 percent for Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on operating income for North America and Corporate. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Generally, bottling and finished product operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. The majority of the deconsolidated entities had previously been included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. \n\n##TABLE_END 59 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, the operating margin for the Latin America operating segment was favorably impacted by the sale of 50 percent of our ownership interest in Le&#227;o Junior, resulting in its deconsolidation, as well as the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Price and product mix also favorably impacted Latin America's operating income and operating margin during the year. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, the operating margin for the North America operating segment was unfavorably impacted by the Company's acquisition of CCE's former North America business. Generally, bottling and finished product operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $74 million due to the acceleration of expense associated with certain share-based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the profit associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company does not recognize the profit associated with concentrate sold to CCE's legacy North America business until the finished beverage products made from those concentrates are sold. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $20 million due to the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn 2010, operating income was reduced by $7 million for Eurasia and Africa, $50 million for Europe, $133 million for North America, $22 million for Pacific, $122 million for Bottling Investments and $485 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Company's productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives; charitable donations; transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE; and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. Refer to the heading \"Other Operating Charges\" above. \n\n##TABLE_END Interest Income \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 &#32; \n\nInterest income was $ 471 million &#32;in 2012 , compared to $ 483 million &#32;in 2011 , a decrease of $12 million, or 2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is held by our international locations. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2010 &#32; \n\nInterest income was $ 483 million &#32;in 2011 , compared to $ 317 million &#32;in 2010 , an increase of $166 million, or 52 percent. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances in addition to higher average interest rates, particularly in international locations. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is held by our international locations. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 \n\nInterest expense was $ 397 million &#32;in 2012 , compared to $ 417 million &#32;in 2011 , a decrease of $20 million, or 5 percent. This decrease reflects the impact of long-term debt maturities during the second quarter of 2012 and a net benefit related to interest rate swaps on our fixed-rate debt, partially offset by the impact of additional long-term debt the Company issued during the first quarter of 2012. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's hedging program. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Cash Flows from Financing Activities &#8212; Debt Financing\" below for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt activity. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2010 &#32; \n\nInterest expense was $ 417 million &#32;in 2011 , compared to $ 733 million &#32;in 2010 , a decrease of $316 million, or 43 percent. This decrease was primarily due to a $342 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the premiums paid to repurchase long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the Company's debt tender offer in 2010. The decrease was partially offset by the full year impact of increased interest expense on long-term debt assumed in connection with the Company's acquisition of CCE's former North America business as well as additional long-term debt issued by the Company in 2011. The Company's interest expense also includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our interest rate swaps. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Cash Flows from Financing Activities &#8212; Debt Financing\" below for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt activity. \n\nEquity Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 &#32; \n\nEquity income (loss) &#8212; net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2012 , equity income was $ 819 million , compared to equity income of $ 690 million &#32;in 2011 , an increase of $129 million, or 19 percent. This increase was primarily due to more favorable operating results reported by certain of our equity method investees, a decrease in the impact of unusual or infrequent charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees, and the Company's acquisition of an equity ownership interest in Aujan during 2012, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the unusual or infrequent charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2011 , versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2010 &#32; \n\nIn 2011 , equity income was $ 690 million , compared to equity income of $ 1,025 million &#32;in 2010 , a decrease of $335 million, or 33 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the Company's acquisition and consolidation of CCE's former North America business during the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of this transaction, the Company stopped recording equity income related to CCE beginning October 2, 2010, and our 2011 consolidated statement of income reflects the full year impact of not having an equity interest in New CCE. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above. In addition, the decrease in equity income (loss) &#8212; net was partially due to the Company's sale of its investment in Coca-Cola Embonor, S.A. (\"Embonor\") during the first quarter of 2011. Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisition and divestiture activities. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by the Company's proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees and the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. \n\nOther Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nOther income (loss) &#8212; net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses; dividend income; rental income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities; other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities; and the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2012, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $ 137 million , primarily related to a gain of $185 million due to the merger of Embotelladora Andina S.A. (\"Andina\") and Embotelladoras Coca-Cola Polar S.A. (\"Polar\"); a gain of $92 million the Company recognized as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA, an equity method investee, issuing additional shares of its own stock at per share amounts greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment; dividend income of $44 million; and net gains of $31 million related to fluctuations in the fair value of the Company's trading securities and the sale of available-for-sale securities. The favorable impact of the previous items was partially offset by a charge of $108 million due to the loss we recognized on the pending sale of a majority ownership interest in our consolidated Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA; a charge of $82 million related to the premium we paid in excess of the publicly traded market price to acquire an ownership interest in Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Ltd. (\"Mikuni\"); and charges of $16 million due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair values of certain cost method investments. Refer to Note 2 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2011, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $ 529 million , primarily related to a net gain of $ 417 million &#32;the Company recognized due to the merger of Arca and Contal; a net gain of $ 122 million &#32;the Company recognized due to Coca-Cola FEMSA issuing additional shares of its own stock at per share amounts greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment, partially offset by charges associated with certain of the Company's equity method investments in Japan; and a gain of $ 102 million &#32;due to the sale of our investment in Embonor. Other income (loss) &#8212; net also included $10 million of realized and unrealized gains on trading securities. The net favorable impact of the previous items was partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses of $73 million; charges of $ 41 million &#32;due to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting; $ 17 million &#32;due to other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain of the Company's available-for-sale securities; and $ 5 million &#32;due to the finalization of working capital adjustments associated with the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE during the fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2010, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $ 5,185 million , primarily related to a $4,978 million gain due to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon the close of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business and a $597 million gain related to the sale of all our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading \"Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These gains were partially offset by a $265 million charge related to preexisting relationships with CCE and foreign currency exchange losses of $148 million. The charge related to preexisting relationships was primarily due to the write-off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. The foreign currency exchange losses were primarily due to a charge of $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. In addition to the items mentioned above, other income (loss) &#8212; net also included a $23 million gain on the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&#227;o Junior and $48 million of charges related to other-than-temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity investees. Refer to Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent . As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Swaziland. The terms of these grants expire from 2015 &#32;to 2020 . We expect each of these grants to be renewed indefinitely. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $ 168 million , $ 193 million &#32;and $ 145 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. \n\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs Adjusted \n\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nState and local income taxes &#8212; net of federal benefit \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal rate \n\n(9.5 \n\n) \n\n1,2 &#160; \n\n(9.5 \n\n) \n\n5,6,7 &#160; \n\n(5.6 \n\n) \n\n15 &#160; \n\nReversal of valuation allowances \n\n(2.4 \n\n) \n\n3 &#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity income or loss \n\n(2.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n8 &#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n) \n\n16 &#160; \n\nCCE transaction \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(12.5 \n\n) \n\n17,18 &#160; \n\nSale of Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n9 &#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n19 &#160; \n\nOther operating charges \n\n0.4 \n\n4 &#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n10 &#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n20 &#160; \n\nOther &#8212; net \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8 \n\n) \n\n11,12,13,14 &#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n21,22 &#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n23.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n16.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes a tax expense of $133 million (or a 1.1 percent impact on our effective tax rate) related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes a tax expense of $57 million on pretax net gains of $76 million (or a 0.3 percent impact on our effective tax rate) related to the following: a gain recognized as a result of the merger of Andina and Polar; a gain recognized as a result of Coca-Cola FEMSA, an equity method investee, issuing additional shares of its own stock at a per share amount greater than the carrying value of the Company's per share investment; the loss recognized on the pending sale of a majority ownership interest in our consolidated Philippine bottling operations to Coca-Cola FEMSA; and the expense recorded for the premium the Company paid over the publicly traded market price to acquire an ownership interest in Mikuni.

This remeasurement gain was not recognized for tax purposes and therefore no tax expense was recorded on this gain. Also, as a result of this acquisition, the Company was required to reverse $ 34 million &#32;of deferred tax liabilities which were associated with our equity investment in CCE prior to the acquisition. In addition, the Company recognized a $ 265 million &#32;charge related to the settlement of preexisting relationships with CCE, and we recorded a tax benefit of 37 percent &#32;related to this charge. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 302 million . If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate of $ 187 million , exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $ 115 million , which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. \n\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefit amounts is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nIncreases related to prior period tax positions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecreases related to prior period tax positions \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\nIncreases related to current period tax positions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecreases related to current period tax positions \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities \n\n(45 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nReductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(46 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\nIncrease related to acquisition of CCE's former North America business \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncreases (decreases) from effects of foreign currency exchange rates \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(21 \n\n) \n\nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had $ 113 million , $ 110 million &#32;and $ 112 million &#32;in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. Of these amounts, $ 33 million &#32;of expense, $ 2 million &#32;of benefit and $ 17 million &#32;of expense were recognized through income tax expense in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate. \n\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2013 is expected to be approximately 24.0 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in future years. \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position \n\nWe believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Operating Activities\" below. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2013. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. In addition to the Company's cash balances, commercial paper program, and our ability to issue long-term debt, we also had $ 6,314 million &#32;in lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2012 . These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2013 &#32;through 2017 . \n\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. Unit case volume outside the United States represented approximately 80 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2012. We earn a substantial amount of our consolidated operating income and income before income taxes in foreign subsidiaries that either sell concentrate to our local bottling partners or, in certain instances, sell finished products directly to our customers to fulfill the demand for Company beverage products outside the United States. A significant portion of these foreign earnings is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. The Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2012 . With the exception of an insignificant amount, for which U.S. \n\nfederal and state income taxes have already been provided, we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. Additionally, the absence of a government-approved mechanism to convert local currency into U.S. dollars in Argentina and Venezuela restricts the Company's ability to pay dividends from these locations. As of December 31, 2012 , the Company's subsidiaries in Argentina and Venezuela held $247 million and $353 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities. Subsequent to December 31, 2012 , the Venezuelan government devalued its currency, which will result in the Company remeasuring the net assets of our subsidiary in Venezuela. Based on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities denominated in Venezuelan bolivar as of December 31, 2012, we anticipate recognizing a remeasurement loss of $100 million to $125 million during the first quarter of 2013. \n\nNet operating revenues in the United States were $19.7 billion in 2012, or 41 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund significant discretionary activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations, or is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This alternative could result in a higher effective tax rate. While the likelihood is remote, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. This alternative could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. \n\nBased on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. These commitments include, but are not limited to, regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other obligations included under the heading &#8220;Off-Balance Sheet Agreements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations&#8221; below. \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 &#32;was $ 10,645 million , $ 9,474 million &#32;and $ 9,532 million , respectively. \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $1,171 million, or 12 percent, in 2012 &#32;compared to 2011 . This increase reflects higher receipts from customers, lower tax payments and the favorable impact of the Company discontinuing its temporary extension of credit terms in Japan. The favorable impact of the previous items was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations and an increase in contributions to our pension plans. \n\nThe Company discontinued the temporary extension of its credit terms in Japan during the first quarter of 2012. We originally extended our credit terms in Japan during the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the natural disasters that devastated portions of the country on March 11, 2011. This change resulted in an increase in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2012 . \n\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $58 million, or 1 percent, in 2011 &#32;compared to 2010 . This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in contributions to our pension plans of $924 million during 2011, compared to contributions of $77 million in 2010; the temporary extension of the Company's credit terms in Japan as a result of the natural disasters that devastated the northern and eastern portions of the country during the first quarter of 2011; an increase in interest payments related to long-term debt; and an increase in cash payments related to our productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers, a decrease in tax payments, and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on operations. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" above. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of short-term investments \n\n$ \n\n(9,590 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,057 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,579 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of short-term investments \n\n5,622 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,647 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,032 \n\nAcquisitions and investments \n\n(1,535 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(977 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,511 \n\n) \n\nPurchases of other investments \n\n(5,266 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(787 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(132 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments \n\n2,189 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment \n\n(2,780 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,920 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,215 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investing activities \n\n(187 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(93 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(106 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \n\n$ \n\n(11,404 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,524 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,405 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $8,880 million in 2012 &#32;compared to 2011 . This increase was primarily related to a change in the Company's overall cash management program. In an effort to manage counterparty risk and diversify our assets, the Company began to make additional investments in high-quality securities. These investments are primarily classified as available-for-sale securities. Refer to Note 3 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Refer to the headings \"Short-Term Investments,\" \"Purchases of Other Investments\" and \"Proceeds from Disposals of Bottling Companies and Other Investments\" below for the impact this change had on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to the heading \"Overview of Financial Position\" below for the impact this change had on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nShort-Term Investments \n\nIn 2012 , purchases of short-term investments were $ 9,590 million , and proceeds from disposals of short-term investments were $ 5,622 million . This activity resulted in a net cash outflow of $3,968 million during 2012 . In 2011 , purchases of short-term investments were $ 4,057 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of short-term investments were $ 5,647 million , resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,590 million. In 2010 , purchases of short-term investments were $ 4,579 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of short-term investments were $ 4,032 million , resulting in a net cash outflow of $547 million. These short-term investments are time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year and are classified in the line item short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nAcquisitions and Investments \n\nIn 2012 , the Company's acquisition and investment activities totaled $ 1,535 million . These activities were primarily related to the following: our investments in the existing beverage business of Aujan, one of the largest independent beverage companies in the Middle East; our investment in Mikuni, a bottling partner located in Japan; our acquisition of Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Inc. (\"Sacramento bottler\"); and our acquisition of bottling operations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Guatemala. None of the Company's other acquisitions or investments were individually significant. \n\nIn 2011 , the Company's acquisition and investment activities totaled $ 977 million . These activities were primarily related to the acquisitions of Great Plains and Honest Tea, Inc. (\"Honest Tea\"), and an additional investment in Coca-Cola Central Japan Company (\"Central Japan\"). In addition, the Company's acquisition and investment activities during 2011 included immaterial cash payments for the finalization of working capital adjustments related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. Refer to our discussion of this transaction below. None of the Company's other acquisitions or investments were individually significant. \n\nIn 2010 , our Company's acquisition and investment activities totaled $ 2,511 million , which was primarily related to our acquisition of CCE's former North America business; DPS license agreements; our acquisition of Nidan, a Russian juice company; and our additional investment in Fresh Trading Ltd. (\"innocent\"). The Company and the existing shareowners of innocent have a series of outstanding put and call options for the Company to potentially acquire the remaining shares not already owned by the Company. The put and call options are exercisable in stages between 2013 and 2014. The Company anticipates acquiring the majority of the remaining outstanding shares in the second quarter of 2013. None of the Company's other acquisitions or investments were individually significant. \n\nRefer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above and Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 . \n\nPurchases of Other Investments \n\nIn 2012 , purchases of other investments were $ 5,266 million , primarily due to a change in the Company's overall cash management program. In an effort to manage counterparty risk and diversify our assets, the Company began to make additional investments in high-quality securities. Refer to Note 3 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn 2011 , purchases of other investments were $ 787 million , primarily related to long-term investments made by the Company for nonoperating activities. These investments are primarily classified as available-for-sale securities. \n\nProceeds from Disposals of Bottling Companies and Other Investments \n\nIn 2012 , proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments were $ 2,189 million . These proceeds were primarily related to the sale of investments associated with the Company's cash and risk management programs and were not related to the disposal of bottling companies. Refer to Note 2 &#32;and Note 3 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn 2011 , proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments were $ 562 million .

Refer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. The cash flow impact of these transactions in other investing activities represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents held by these entities being transferred to assets held for sale. \n\nIn 2011, other investing activities were primarily related to the Company's investments in joint ventures. None of these investments were individually significant. \n\nIn 2010, other investing activities were primarily related to the deconsolidation of certain entities due to the Company's adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements\" above and Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012, our long-term debt was rated \"AA-\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"Aa3\" by Moody's and \"A+\" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1+\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"P-1\" by Moody's and \"F-1\" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including New CCE, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers. \n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. \n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. \n\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. On December 31, 2012 , we had $ 6,314 million &#32;in lines of credit available for general corporate purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2013 &#32;through 2017 . There were no borrowings under these backup lines of credit during 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. \n\nIn 2012, the Company had issuances of debt of $42,791 million , which included $40,008 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $2,783 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2012, the Company issued $ 2,750 million &#32;of long-term debt. The general terms of the notes issued are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$ 1,000 million &#32;total principal amount of notes due March 14, 2014, at a variable interest rate equal to the three -month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") minus 0.05 percent ; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$ 1,000 million &#32;total principal amount of notes due March 13, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent ; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$ 750 million &#32;total principal amount of notes due March 14, 2018, at a fixed interest rate of 1.65 percent . \n\n##TABLE_END In 2012, the Company had payments of debt of $ 38,573 million . Total payments of debt included $1,553 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and $35,118 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total payments of debt also included long-term debt payments of $1,902 million. \n\nIn 2011, the Company had issuances of debt of $ 27,495 million , which included $25,219 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $2,276 million, net of the debt issued to exchange a certain amount of our existing long-term debt. The Company issued $ 2,979 million &#32;of long-term debt during 2011. We used $ 979 million &#32;of this newly issued debt and paid a premium of $ 208 million &#32;to exchange $ 1,022 million &#32;of existing long-term debt that was assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business in the fourth quarter of 2010. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce the Company's outstanding commercial paper balance and exchange a certain amount of short-term debt. \n\nThe general terms of the notes issued during 2011 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$ 1,655 million &#32;total principal amount of notes due September 1, 2016, at a fixed interest rate of 1.8 percent ; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$ 1,324 million &#32;total principal amount of notes due September 1, 2021, at a fixed interest rate of 3.3 percent . \n\n##TABLE_END During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company extinguished long-term debt that had a carrying value of $ 20 million &#32;and was not scheduled to mature until 2012. This debt was outstanding prior to the Company's acquisition of CCE's former North America business. In addition, the Company repurchased long-term debt during 2011 that was assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. The repurchased debt included $ 99 million &#32;in unamortized fair value adjustments recorded as part of our purchase accounting for the CCE transaction and was settled throughout the year as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased all of our outstanding U.K. pound sterling notes that had a carrying value of $ 674 million ; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased long-term debt that had a carrying value of $ 42 million ; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased long-term debt that had a carrying value of $ 19 million . \n\n##TABLE_END In 2011, the Company had payments of debt of $ 22,530 million , including the repurchased debt discussed above. Total payments of debt included $91 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and $20,334 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total payments of debt also included long-term debt payments of $2,105 million. The Company recorded a net charge of $ 9 million &#32;in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2011. This net charge was due to the exchange, repurchase and/or extinguishment of long-term debt described above. \n\nIn 2010, the Company had issuances of debt of $ 15,251 million , which included $1,171 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and $9,503 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. We also assumed $7.9 billion of debt as a result of our acquisition of CCE's former North America business. In addition, on November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long-term notes. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repurchase $2,910 million of long-term debt, and the remainder was used to reduce our commercial paper balance. The long-term notes issued on November 15, 2010, had the following general terms: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$1,250 million total principal notes due May 15, 2012, at a variable interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.05 percent; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$1,250 million total principal notes due November 15, 2013, at a fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 1.5 percent; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2020, at a fixed interest rate of 3.15 percent. \n\n##TABLE_END 69 \n\nIn 2010, the Company had payments of debt of $ 13,403 million , including the repurchased long-term debt discussed above. Total payments of debt also included $9,667 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long-term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. \n\nThe carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from CCE of $ 617 million &#32;and $ 733 million &#32;as of December 31, 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively. These fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years remaining until the underlying debt matures. As of December 31, 2012 , the weighted-average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 17 years. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $ 574 million , $ 573 million &#32;and $ 422 million &#32;in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. Refer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt balances. \n\nIssuances of Stock \n\nThe issuances of stock in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 &#32;were primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nOn July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to 600 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program took effect on October 31, 2006. Although there are approximately 43 million shares that may yet be purchased under this share repurchase program, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 500 million shares of the Company's common stock on October 18, 2012. The new share repurchase program will allow the Company to continue repurchasing shares following the completion of the prior program. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs Adjusted \n\nNumber of shares repurchased (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage price per share \n\n$ \n\n37.11 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31.92 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSince the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2012 , we have purchased approximately 3.0 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $12.75. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2012, we repurchased $4.5 billion of our stock. However, due to the timing of settlements, the total amount of treasury stock purchases that settled during 2012 was $4.6 billion, which includes treasury stock that was purchased and settled during 2012 as well as treasury stock purchased in December 2011 that settled in early 2012. The net impact of the Company's treasury stock issuance and purchase activities in 2012 resulted in a net cash outflow of $3.1 billion. We currently expect to repurchase an additional $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion of our stock during 2013, net of proceeds from the issuance of stock due to the exercise of employee stock options. \n\nDividends \n\nAt its February 2013 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 10 percent, raising it to $0.28 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.12 per share in 2013. This is our 51 st &#32;consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $ 1.02 &#32;per share, $ 0.94 &#32;per share and $ 0.88 &#32;per share in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. The 2012 &#32;dividend represented an 8.5 percent increase from 2011 , and the 2011 &#32;dividend represented a 7 percent increase from 2010 . \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation under certain guarantee contracts; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation under certain derivative instruments; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. \n\n##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2012 , we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $ 671 million , of which $ 294 million &#32;was related to VIEs. These guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees were individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2012 , we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. \n\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , the Company had $ 6,314 million &#32;in lines of credit for general corporate purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2013 through 2017. There were no borrowings under these backup lines of credit during 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which are presently significant to our Company. \n\nAggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , the Company's contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2014-2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016-2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 and \n\nThereafter \n\nShort-term loans and notes payable: 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommercial paper borrowings \n\n$ \n\n16,204 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,204 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nLines of credit and other short-term borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt 2 \n\n1,490 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,490 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities 2 \n\n14,082 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,970 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,048 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,064 \n\nEstimated interest payments 3 \n\n4,477 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,849 \n\nAccrued income taxes 4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations 5 \n\n14,274 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,297 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,481 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,910 \n\nMarketing obligations 6 \n\n4,461 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,331 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLease obligations \n\n1,084 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHeld-for-sale obligations 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n$ \n\n57,324 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,182 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,390 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,963 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,789 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 &#160; \n\nWe calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term fixed-rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2012 , the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was $410 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5 &#160; \n\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6 &#160; \n\nWe expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 7 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the assets and liabilities of our consolidated Philippine and Brazilian bottling operations being classified as held for sale. \n\n##TABLE_END The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2012 , was $3,406 million. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. \n\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\"PPA\") was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $6,604 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $5,549 million. The majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets and the decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligation. \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $3,089 million, and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was $2,035 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately $65 million in 2013 and remain near that level through 2025, decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2013, we expect to contribute an additional $640 million to various pension plans. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. \n\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2012 , our self-insurance reserves totaled approximately $ 508 million . Refer to Note 11 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above. \n\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2012 , were $5,312 million. Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. \n\nIn 2012 , we used 81 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAll operating currencies \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nBrazilian real \n\n(14 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMexican peso \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAustralian dollar \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSouth African rand \n\n(12 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBritish pound \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\nEuro \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nJapanese yen \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThese percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of approximately 5 percent and an increase of approximately 4 percent in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Based on spot rates as of the beginning of February 2013, our hedging coverage in place, and the impact of Venezuela's currency devaluation discussed below, the Company \n\nexpects currencies to have a 4 percent negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of 2013 and a 1 percent negative impact on operating income for the full year of 2013. \n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" above. The Company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $2 million, $73 million and $148 million in 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. \n\nHyperinflationary Economies \n\nOur Company conducts business in more than 200 countries, some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years. These economies create financial exposure to the Company. \n\nIn 2010, Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy, and the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official rate of exchange (&#8220;official rate&#8221;) from 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar to 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods and 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods. In order to utilize the official rate, entities must seek approval from the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (&#8220;CADIVI&#8221;). In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. As a result, during the first quarter of 2010 we remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar which resulted in a loss of $103 million. The loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. We classified the impact of the remeasurement loss in the line item effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\nIn June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system known as the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (\"SITME\"). This system, which was subject to annual limits, enabled entities domiciled in Venezuela to exchange their bolivars to U.S. dollars through authorized financial institutions (commercial banks, savings and lending institutions, etc.). \n\nIn December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that it was eliminating the official rate of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods. As a result, the only two exchange rates available for remeasuring bolivar-denominated transactions were the official rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods and the SITME rate. As discussed above, the Company remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar starting on January 1, 2010. Therefore, the elimination of the official rate for essential goods had no impact on the remeasurement of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. \n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2012, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency further to an official rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The government also announced that it was discontinuing the SITME foreign exchange system. As a result, the Company will remeasure the net assets of our local subsidiary and recognize the related gains or losses from remeasurement in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. Based on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities denominated in Venezuelan bolivar as of December 31, 2012, we anticipate recognizing a remeasurement loss of $100 million to $125 million during the first quarter of 2013. \n\nThe Company will continue to use the official rate to remeasure the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. If the official rate devalues further, it would result in our Company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange gains or losses in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2012, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $450 million and monetary liabilities of approximately $85 million. \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. If we are unable to utilize a government-approved exchange rate mechanism to settle future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the Company's outstanding receivables balance related to these sales will continue to increase. In addition, we have certain intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. If the bolivar further devalues, it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets. As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our accounts receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela for these concentrate sales and intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela totaled $216 million. \n\nThe Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. \n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices \n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. \n\nOverview of Financial Position \n\nThe following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Company's consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs Adjusted \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n8,442 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,803 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,361 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(34 \n\n)% \n\nShort-term investments \n\n5,017 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,088 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,929 \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketable securities \n\n3,092 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,948 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,047 \n\nTrade accounts receivable &#8212; net \n\n4,759 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,920 \n\n&#160; \n\n(161 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\nInventories \n\n3,264 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,092 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPrepaid expenses and other assets \n\n2,781 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,450 \n\n&#160; \n\n(669 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n) \n\nAssets held for sale \n\n2,973 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,973 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nEquity method investments \n\n9,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,983 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investments, principally bottling companies \n\n1,232 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,141 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther assets \n\n3,585 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,495 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, plant and equipment &#8212; net \n\n14,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,939 \n\n&#160; \n\n(463 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\nTrademarks with indefinite lives \n\n6,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,430 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives \n\n7,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,770 \n\n&#160; \n\n(365 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nGoodwill \n\n12,255 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,219 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther intangible assets \n\n1,150 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n(100 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\nTotal assets \n\n$ \n\n86,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n79,974 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,200 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses \n\n$ \n\n8,680 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,009 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(329 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n)% \n\nLoans and notes payable \n\n16,297 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,871 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,426 \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt \n\n1,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,041 \n\n&#160; \n\n(464 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\nAccrued income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLiabilities held for sale \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLong-term debt \n\n14,736 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,656 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,080 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther liabilities \n\n5,468 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,420 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred income taxes \n\n4,981 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,694 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal liabilities \n\n$ \n\n53,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n48,053 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,953 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nNet assets \n\n$ \n\n33,168 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,921 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,247 \n\n1 &#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes a decrease in net assets of $144 million resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. \n\n##TABLE_END The table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $ 4,361 million , or 34 percent , primarily due to a change in the Company's overall cash management program which resulted in more of our cash balances being transferred into short-term investments as well as high-quality marketable securities.
