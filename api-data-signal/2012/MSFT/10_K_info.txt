MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (&#147;MD&#38;A&#148;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nMicrosoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes. \n\nIndustry Trends \n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. \n\nKey Opportunities and Investments \n\nBased on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to generate future growth. \n\nWe invest research and development resources in new products and services in these areas. The capabilities and accessibility of PCs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. With this trend, we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives. \n\nDevices with end-user services \n\nWe work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. In some cases, we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Surface. In all our work with partners and on our own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers around the world. \n\nWindows 8 reflects this shift. Launched in October 2012, Windows 8 was designed to unite the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a PC. The Windows 8 operating system includes the Windows Store, which offers a large and growing number of applications from Microsoft and partners for both business and consumer customers. \n\nGoing forward, our strategy will focus on creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home, at work, and on the go, for the activities they value most. This strategy will require investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services, and will bring continued competition with Apple, Google, and other well-established and emerging competitors. We believe our history of powering devices such as Windows PCs and Xbox, as well as our experience delivering high-value experiences through Office and other applications, will position us for future success. \n\nServices for the enterprise \n\nToday, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprises are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. At the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nTo address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like Microsoft Dynamics, Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, Yammer, and our business intelligence solutions. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. And, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to Microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud. \n\nHelping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. Cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. Because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. For businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. \n\nUnique to Microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on-premise assets however best suits their own needs. For example, a company can choose to deploy Office or Microsoft Dynamics on premise, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. With Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure, and System Center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner&#146;s datacenter, or in Microsoft&#146;s datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. These hybrid capabilities allow customers to fully harness the power of the cloud so they can achieve greater levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth. \n\nOur future opportunity \n\nThere are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. We are investing significant resources in: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gesture, and speech. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering new high-value experiences with improvements in how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another. \n\n##TABLE_END We believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing Windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas. \n\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks \n\nThe market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Some of our traditional businesses such as the Windows operating system are in a period of transition. Our competitors are developing new devices and deploy competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user&#146;s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve and adapt, over an extended time, in pace with this changing environment. To support our strategy of offering \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\na family of devices and services designed to empower our customers for the activities they value most, we announced a functional realignment in July 2013. Through this realignment our goal is to become more nimble, collaborative, communicative, motivated, and decisive. Even if we achieve these benefits, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure to support our cloud-based services will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operation margins. \n\nWe prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition. \n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation. \n\nAggregate demand for our software, services, and hardware is correlated to global macroeconomic factors, which remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). \n\nSeasonality \n\nOur revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Entertainment and Devices Division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Entertainment and Devices Division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter. \n\nUnearned Revenue \n\nQuarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the &#147;Windows Upgrade Offer&#148;) and sales of the previous version of the Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new Office at minimal or no cost (the &#147;Office Upgrade Offer&#148;, for the offer relating to the new Office, and &#147;the 2010 Office Upgrade Offer&#148; for the prior offer relating to Office 2010). \n\nIf our customers elect to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nSummary \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2013 Versus 2012 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2012 Versus 2011 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 77,849 &#160; &#160; $ 73,723 &#160; &#160; $ 69,943 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 26,764 &#160; &#160; $ 21,763 &#160; &#160; $ 27,161 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23% &#160; &#160; &#160; (20)% &#160; Diluted earnings per share \n\n&#160; $ 2.58 &#160; &#160; $ 2.00 &#160; &#160; $ 2.69 &#160; &#160; &#160; 29% &#160; &#160; &#160; (26)% &#160; ##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nRevenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from Server and Tools as well as revenue from new products and services, including Windows 8, Surface, and the new Office, offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income grew, primarily due to the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our OSD business recorded during the prior year. Other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Cost of revenue increased $2.7 billion or 16%, reflecting increased product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8, including an approximately $900 million charge for Surface RT inventory adjustments, higher headcount-related expenses, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, royalties on Xbox LIVE content, and retail stores expenses, offset in part by decreased costs associated with lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles and decreased traffic acquisition costs. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion or 10%, reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Research and development expenses increased $600 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, largely related to the Entertainment and Devices Division. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; General and administrative expenses increased $580 million or 13%, due to higher legal charges, primarily the EU fine of $733 million. \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nRevenue increased primarily due to strong sales of Server and Tools products and services and the 2010 Microsoft Office system, offset in part by the decline in Windows operating system revenue primarily due to the deferral of $540 million of revenue relating to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Revenue in fiscal year 2012 also included Skype revenue from the date of acquisition. \n\nOperating income decreased reflecting a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion related to our OSD business segment. Other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Cost of revenue increased $2.0 billion or 13%, reflecting higher costs associated with providing Server and Tools products and services, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, higher Xbox 360 royalty costs, and other changes in the mix of products and services sold. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Research and development expenses increased $768 million or 8%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; General and administrative expenses increased $347 million or 8%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses and the full year impact of new Puerto Rican excise taxes, offset in part by decreased legal charges. \n\n##TABLE_END Headcount-related expenses were higher across the company reflecting a 4% increase in headcount from June 30, 2011 and changes in our employee compensation program. \n\nFiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.73. Fiscal year 2011 net income and diluted earnings per share reflected a partial settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (&#147;I.R.S.&#148;) and higher other income. The partial settlement with the I.R.S. added $461 million to net income and $0.05 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2011. \n\nSEGMENT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) \n\nThe revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Segment information appearing in Note 21 &#150; Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. We have recast certain prior period amounts within this MD&#38;A to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2013, reflecting immaterial movements of \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nbusiness activities between segments and changes in cost allocations. In July 2013, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As we evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure, it is possible that our segments may change. \n\nWindows Division \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2013 Versus 2012 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2012 Versus 2011 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 19,239 &#160; &#160; $ 18,400 &#160; &#160; $ 19,061 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5% &#160; &#160; &#160; (3)% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 9,504 &#160; &#160; $ 11,555 &#160; &#160; $ 12,280 &#160; &#160; &#160; (18)% &#160; &#160; &#160; (6)% &#160; ##TABLE_END Windows Division develops and markets operating systems for computing devices, related software and online services, Surface RT and Pro devices, and PC accessories. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to empower individuals, companies, and organizations and to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user&#146;s hardware and software. The general availability of Surface RT and Windows 8 started October 26, 2012. The general availability of Surface Pro started February 9, 2013. \n\nCurrently, approximately 65% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating systems purchased by original equipment manufacturers (&#147;OEMs&#148;) and pre-installed on devices they sell. The remaining Windows Division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows, Surface, PC accessories, and online advertising. \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nWindows Division revenue increased $839 million. Surface revenue was $853 million. Revenue from commercial licensing of Windows increased $487 million, while unearned revenue from commercial licensing also increased, reflecting continued support of our platform. In addition, we recognized $540 million of previously deferred revenue related to the expiration of the Windows Upgrade Offer. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in OEM revenue. \n\nOEM revenue decreased 3%. Excluding the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer, OEM revenue decreased 10%. This decrease primarily reflects the impact on revenue of the decline in the x86 PC market, which we estimate declined approximately 9%. \n\nIn May 2013, we announced that we had surpassed 100 million licenses sold for Windows 8. \n\nWindows Division operating income decreased, primarily due to higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue increased $1.8 billion, reflecting a $1.6 billion increase in product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8, including a charge for Surface RT inventory adjustments of approximately $900 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.0 billion or 34%, reflecting an $898 million increase in advertising costs associated primarily with Windows 8 and Surface. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nWindows Division revenue reflected relative performance in the PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 4% and sales of PCs to consumers decreased 1%. Excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of PCs to consumers grew approximately 5%. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 0% to 2%. Relative to PC market growth, Windows Division revenue was negatively impacted by higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets, and the deferral of $540 million of revenue relating to the Windows Upgrade Offer. \n\nWindows Division operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and a $172 million or 11% increase in research and development expenses, primarily associated with the Windows 8 operating system. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2013 Versus 2012 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2012 Versus 2011 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 20,281 &#160; &#160; $ 18,534 &#160; &#160; $ 16,559 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; &#160; 12% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 8,164 &#160; &#160; $ 7,235 &#160; &#160; $ 6,105 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; &#160; 19% &#160; ##TABLE_END Server and Tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings include Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure, Visual Studio, System Center products, Windows Embedded device platforms, and Enterprise Services. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. We also offer developer tools, training, and certification. Approximately 80% of Server and Tools revenue comes from product revenue, including purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged product, while the remainder comes from Enterprise Services. \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nServer and Tools revenue increased in both product sales and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $1.3 billion or 9%, driven primarily by growth in Microsoft SQL Server, System Center, and Windows Server. Enterprise Services revenue grew $434 million or 11%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services. \n\nServer and Tools operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue grew $589 million or 15%, reflecting a $269 million increase in headcount-related expenses and a $169 million increase in datacenter expenses. Headcount-related expenses increased due mainly to higher Enterprise Services headcount supporting revenue growth, while datacenter expenses grew primarily to support our online services offerings. Sales and marketing expenses grew $160 million or 3%, reflecting increased fees paid to third-party enterprise software advisors and corporate sales and marketing activities. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nServer and Tools revenue increased in both product sales and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in SQL Server, Windows Server, and System Center, reflecting continued adoption of the Windows platform. Enterprise Services revenue grew $585 million or 17%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services. \n\nServer and Tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher costs of providing products and services and increased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $678 million or 22%, primarily reflecting higher Enterprise Services headcount-related expenses.

Search revenue grew primarily due to increased revenue per search, resulting from ongoing improvements in ad products, while display advertising revenue decreased primarily due to industry-wide market pressure. \n\nOSD&#146;s operating loss decreased, primarily due to the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion. Operating loss was further reduced by higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $302 million or 12%, driven by a $271 million decrease in traffic acquisition costs as well as lower Yahoo! reimbursement costs. Sales and marketing expenses were $120 million or 15% lower, due mainly to decreased corporate sales and marketing activities. Research and development costs increased $94 million or 7%, due primarily to higher headcount-related expenses resulting mainly from increased headcount. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nOnline advertising revenue grew $317 million or 14% to $2.6 billion, reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to increased revenue per search, increased volumes reflecting general market growth, and share gains in the U.S. According to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share for the month of June 2012 was approximately 16%, and grew 120 basis points year over year. Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 26% for the month of June 2012, down 100 basis points year over year. \n\nOSD&#146;s fiscal year 2012 operating loss reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion, which we recorded as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. The non-cash, non-tax-deductible charge related mainly to goodwill acquired through our 2007 acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. Excluding the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge, OSD&#146;s operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $321 million or 29%, due mainly to lower marketing spend. Cost of revenue decreased $208 million, driven by lower Yahoo! reimbursement costs, amortization, and online operating costs. \n\nMicrosoft Business Division \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2013 Versus 2012 &#160; &#160; Percentage Change 2012 Versus 2011 &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 24,724 &#160; &#160; $ 24,111 &#160; &#160; $ 22,607 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3% &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 16,194 &#160; &#160; $ 15,832 &#160; &#160; $ 14,678 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2% &#160; &#160; &#160; 8% &#160; ##TABLE_END Microsoft Business Division (&#147;MBD&#148;) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (&#147;Office,&#148; comprising mainly the core Office product set, Office 365, SharePoint, Exchange, and Lync), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. The general availability of the new Office started on January 29, 2013. \n\nWe evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue and consumer revenue. Business revenue includes Office revenue generated through subscription and volume licensing agreements with software assurance, license-only agreements for Office, and Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue. \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nMBD revenue increased reflecting growth in business revenue, partially offset by a decline in consumer revenue. Business revenue increased $1.2 billion or 6%, which reflects 11% growth in Office revenue from subscriptions and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nvolume licensing agreements with software assurance, and a 12% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue, offset in part by a 9% decrease in Office license-only revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $582 million or 13%, primarily driven by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market. \n\nMBD revenue for the year ended June 30, 2013 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $475 million. \n\nMBD operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses grew $185 million or 5%, primarily due to higher advertising expenses, fees paid to third-party software advisors, and increased cross-platform marketing activities. Cost of revenue grew $108 million or 6%, primarily due to an increase in online operation and support costs. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nMBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of Office. Business revenue increased $1.7 billion or 9%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of Office to transactional business customers, and a 9% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue decreased $193 million or 4% due to the recognition of $254 million of revenue in the prior year associated with the 2010 Office Upgrade Offer. Excluding the fiscal year 2011 impact associated with the 2010 Office Upgrade Offer, consumer revenue increased $61 million, driven by increased sales of Office. \n\nMBD revenue for the year ended June 30, 2012 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $506 million. \n\nMBD operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue and research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $278 million or 17%, primarily due to higher online operation and support costs.

EDD offerings include the Xbox entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Skype, and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing revenue. We acquired Skype on October 13, 2011, and its results of operations from that date are reflected in our results discussed below. In June 2013, we announced that we expect our next generation console, Xbox One, to be available for purchase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nEDD revenue increased, due to higher Windows Phone and Skype revenue, offset in part by lower Xbox 360 platform revenue. Windows Phone revenue increased $1.2 billion, including an increase in patent licensing revenue and sales of Windows Phone licenses. Skype revenue increased, due primarily to including a full year of results in fiscal year 2013. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $950 million or 12%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 9.8 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2013, compared with 13.0 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2012. \n\nEDD operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and lower cost of revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses.

Cost of revenue decreased $143 million or 2%, due mainly to a $1.0 billion decrease in manufacturing and distribution costs associated with lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold, offset in part by a $375 million increase in expenses for payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and a $273 million increase in royalties on Xbox LIVE content. Research and development expenses increased $432 million or 28%, reflecting $246 million higher headcount-related expenses, resulting mainly from increased headcount in connection with the Xbox platform and Skype. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nEDD revenue increased primarily reflecting Skype and Windows Phone revenue, offset in part by lower Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $107 million, due mainly to decreased volumes of Kinect for Xbox 360 sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 13.0 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2012, compared with 13.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2011. Video game revenue decreased due to strong sales of Halo Reach in the prior year. \n\nEDD operating income decreased reflecting higher cost of revenue and operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue grew $896 million or 16%, primarily due to changes in the mix of products and services sold and payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives. Research and development expenses increased $366 million or 31%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (&#147;OCI&#148;) until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;) into other income (expense). \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nDividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our Facebook holding in the prior year, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $208 million in fiscal year 2013, compared with $298 million in fiscal year 2012. Net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with losses in the prior fiscal year, and lower losses on commodity and foreign exchange derivatives as compared to the prior fiscal year, offset in part by losses on interest-rate derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to gains in the prior fiscal year. For the current year, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nDividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt in the prior year. Net recognized gains on investments increased, primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our Facebook holding upon the initial public offering on May 18, 2012, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $298 million in fiscal year 2012, compared with $80 million in fiscal year 2011. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity and equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with gains in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by fewer losses on foreign exchange contracts in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19% and 24%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. \n\nOur fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5% from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012. The goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10% in fiscal year 2012. In addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we recognized a reduction of 18% and 21%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1% increase related to the EU fine, which is not tax deductible. \n\nChanges in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. As discussed above, Windows Division operating income declined $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2013, while MBD and Server and Tools operating income increased $362 million and $929 million, respectively, during this same period. We supply Windows, our primary Windows Division product, to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office System, our primary MBD product, and our Server and Tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our U.S. income before income taxes was $6.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 25% and 7%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.4 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 75% and 93%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. The primary driver for the increase in the U.S. income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year. \n\nTax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to transfer pricing, including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily Denmark. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2012. \n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were approximately 24% and 18%, respectively. Our effective tax rates were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. \n\nOur fiscal year 2012 effective rate increased by 6% from fiscal year 2011 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10%. In addition, in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we recognized \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\na reduction of 21% and 16%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. In fiscal year 2011, we settled a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million and reduced the effective tax rate by 2%. \n\nChanges in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. As discussed above, Windows Division operating income declined $751 million in fiscal year 2012, while MBD and Server and Tools operating income increased $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, during this same period. We supply Windows, our primary Windows Division product, to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office System, our primary MBD product, and our Server and Tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2012 and 2011, our U.S. income before income taxes was $1.6 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, and comprised 7% and 32%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, and comprised 93% and 68%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. The primary driver for the decrease in the U.S. income before income tax in fiscal year 2012 was the goodwill impairment charge. \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $77.0 billion as of June 30, 2013, compared with $63.0 billion as of June 30, 2012. Equity and other investments were $10.8 billion as of June 30, 2013, compared with $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. While we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of June 30, 2013 does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. The majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association. \n\nWe routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. Our gross exposures to our customers and investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain are individually and collectively not material. \n\nOf the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2013, approximately $69.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $880 million. As of June 30, 2013, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 4% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and 2% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. \n\nSecurities lending \n\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nthe borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $645 million as of June 30, 2013. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $494 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. \n\nValuation \n\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. agency securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. \n\nCash Flows \n\nFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 \n\nCash flows from operations decreased $2.8 billion during the current fiscal year to $28.8 billion, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. Cash used for financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion, due mainly to a $3.5 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid and a $982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used in investing decreased $975 million to $23.8 billion, due mainly to an $8.5 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $5.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales and a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment. \n\nFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 \n\nCash flows from operations increased $4.6 billion during fiscal year 2012 to $31.6 billion, due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. Cash used for financing increased $1.0 billion to $9.4 billion, due mainly to a $6.0 billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $1.2 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.5 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $10.2 billion to $24.8 billion, due mainly to a $10.0 billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a $1.4 billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in cash used for net purchases, maturities, and sales of investments. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nDebt \n\nWe issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. \n\nAs of June 30, 2013, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2012. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs. \n\nThe components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows as of June 30, 2013: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Due Date &#160; Face Value &#160; &#160; Stated Interest \n\nRate \n\n&#160; &#160; Effective Interest \n\nRate \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; (In millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Notes &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; September 27, 2013 \n\n&#160; $ 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.875% &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.000% &#160; June 1, 2014 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.950% &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.049% &#160; September 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,750 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.625% &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.795% &#160; February 8, 2016 \n\n&#160; &#160; 750 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.500% &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.642% &#160; November 15, 2017 (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 600 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.875% &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.084% &#160; May 1, 2018 (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 450 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.000% &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.106% &#160; June 1, 2019 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.200% &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.379% &#160; October 1, 2020 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.000% &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.137% &#160; February 8, 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 500 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.000% &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.082% &#160; November 15, 2022 (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 750 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.125% &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.239% &#160; May 1, 2023 (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.375% &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.465% &#160; May 2, 2033 (c) \n\n&#160; &#160; 715 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.625% &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.690% &#160; June 1, 2039 \n\n&#160; &#160; 750 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.200% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.240% &#160; October 1, 2040 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.500% &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.567% &#160; February 8, 2041 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.300% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.361% &#160; November 15, 2042 (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 900 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.500% &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.571% &#160; May 1, 2043 (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 500 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.750% &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.829% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 15,665 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) In November 2012, we issued $2.25 billion of debt securities. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (b) In April 2013, we issued $1.95 billion of debt securities. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (c) In April 2013, we issued &#128; 550 million of debt securities. \n\n##TABLE_END Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. As of June 30, 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $65 million. \n\nNotes \n\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nConvertible Debt \n\nIn June 2013, we paid cash of $1.25 billion for the principal amount of our zero coupon convertible unsecured debt and elected to deliver cash for the $96 million excess obligation resulting from the conversion of the notes. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 30.68 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $32.59 per share. As of June 30, 2012, the net carrying amount of the convertible debt and the unamortized discount were $1.2 billion and $19 million, respectively. \n\nIn connection with the issuance of the notes in 2010, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes. Upon conversion of the notes in June 2013, we exercised the capped calls. The bulk of the capped calls were physically settled by acquiring 29 million shares of our own common stock for $938 million. The remaining capped calls were net cash settled for $24 million. \n\nCredit Facility \n\nIn June 2013, we established a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of up to $1.3 billion in commercial paper. As of June 30, 2013, we have not issued any commercial paper under this program. \n\nIn June 2013, we entered into a $1.3 billion credit facility, which will serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. The credit facility expires on June 24, 2018. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility since its inception. \n\nUnearned Revenue \n\nUnearned revenue at June 30, 2013 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2013 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; OEM minimum commitments; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. \n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2013: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; Three Months Ending, &#160; &#160; &#160; September 30, 2013 \n\n&#160; $ 7,790 &#160; December 31, 2013 \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,571 &#160; March 31, 2014 \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,252 &#160; June 30, 2014 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,026 &#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,760 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 22,399 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Share Repurchases \n\nOn September 22, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of September 30, 2013. As of June 30, 2013, approximately $3.6 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount.

We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. \n\n##TABLE_END Other Planned Uses of Capital \n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. \n\nLiquidity \n\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. \n\nShould we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance \n\nIn September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income (&#147;OCI&#148;) and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and OCI or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted this new guidance beginning July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity&#146;s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. \n\nIn February 2013, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;). This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. \n\nIn March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parent&#146;s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. \n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether the vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of fair value exists for those elements. A portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify the VSOE for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (&#147;Software Assurance&#148;) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. \n\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (&#147;PCS&#148;) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. \n\nWindows 8.1 will enable new hardware, further the integration with other Microsoft services and address customer issues with Windows 8, and will be provided to Windows 8 customers when available at no additional charge. We evaluated Windows 8.1 and determined that it did not meet the definition of an upgrade and thus have not deferred revenue related to this planned release. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nWindows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer, which started June 2, 2012. The offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchased Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft was responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired. \n\nMicrosoft Office system revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the Office Upgrade Offer, which started October 19, 2012. The Office Upgrade Offer allowed customers who purchased qualifying 2010 Microsoft Office system or Office for Mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to Office 365 Home Premium or the equivalent version of 2013 Microsoft Office system upon general availability. Small business customers in applicable markets were also eligible for a three-month trial of Office 365 Small Business Premium. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 Microsoft Office system and subscription services was deferred until the products and services were delivered or the redemption period expired. \n\nImpairment of Investment Securities \n\nWe review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \n\nGoodwill \n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. \n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. \n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \n\nResearch and Development Costs \n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nsoftware costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPART II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT&#146;S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management&#146;s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. \n\nThe Company engaged Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). \n\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. \n\n##TABLE_START Steven A. Ballmer Chief Executive Officer Amy E.
