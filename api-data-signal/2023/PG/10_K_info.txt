A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\" and the section titled \"Risk Factors\" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K. \n\nPurpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures \n\nThe purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&#38;A) is to provide an understanding of Procter &#38; Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&#38;A is organized in the following sections: \n\n&#8226; Overview \n\n&#8226; Summary of 2024 Results \n\n&#8226; Economic Conditions and Uncertainties \n\n&#8226; Results of Operations \n\n&#8226; Segment Results \n\n&#8226; Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity \n\n&#8226; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n&#8226; Other Information \n\nThroughout the MD&#38;A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, including organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&#38;A provides the \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 15 \n\ndefinition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. \n\nManagement also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&#38;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nP&#38;G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries. \n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS). \n\nSector Business Units \n\nThe Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &#38; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&#38;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). \n\n16 The Procter &#38; Gamble Company \n\nThe following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the product categories and brand composition within each segment. ##TABLE_START Reportable Segments % of \n\nNet Sales (1) \n\n% of Net \n\nEarnings (1) \n\nProduct Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty 18% 18% \n\nHair Care ( Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments ) \n\nHead &#38; Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice \n\nSkin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) \n\nOlay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-II, Native Grooming 8% 9% \n\nGrooming ( Appliances, Female Blades &#38; Razors, Male Blades &#38; Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming ) \n\nBraun, Gillette, Venus Health Care 14% 14% \n\nOral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpastes, Other Oral Care ) \n\nCrest, Oral-B \n\nPersonal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Pain Relief, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care ) \n\nMetamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, Vicks Fabric &#38; Home Care 36% 34% \n\nFabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) \n\nAriel, Downy, Gain, Tide \n\nHome Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&#38;G Professional, Surface Care ) \n\nCascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care 24% 25% \n\nBaby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) \n\nLuvs, Pampers \n\nFeminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Menstrual Care ) \n\nAlways, Always Discreet, Tampax \n\nFamily Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) \n\nBounty, Charmin, Puffs ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (excluding results held in Corporate). \n\nOrganization Design: \n\nSector Business Units \n\nBeauty: We are a global market leader amongst the beauty categories in which we compete, including hair care and skin and personal care.

The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&#38;G. \n\nStrategic Focus \n\nProcter &#38; Gamble aspires to serve the world&#8217;s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation. \n\nOur strategy is to deliver and sustain value creation through five integrated choices: a portfolio of daily-use products where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value; productivity; constructive disruption of the entire value chain; and a highly efficient and effective organization structure. \n\nThe Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, plays to P&#38;G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of product categories where P&#38;G has strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies with typically leadership market positions. \n\nWithin these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&#38;G&#8217;s lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&#38;G. \n\nOngoing productivity improvement is strategic and crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&#38;D programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate and manage through periods of challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity, inflation and negative foreign exchange impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending. \n\nWe act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value. \n\nWe are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs. \n\nAdditionally, to further strengthen our integrated strategy, we have declared four focus areas. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity and 4) delivering a superior employee value equation for all employees inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities - for all roles - to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent to better serve our diverse consumer base. \n\nWe believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. \n\nThe Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group: \n\n&#8226; Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete; \n\n&#8226; Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and \n\n&#8226; Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. \n\nWhile periods of significant macroeconomic pressures may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business. \n\n18 The Procter &#38; Gamble Company \n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS \n\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring \n\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company announced that it expected to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax, consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. \n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs were reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIntangible Asset Impairment \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge on an indefinite-lived intangible asset acquired as part of the Company&#8217;s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. For a more detailed discussion of the Gillette impairment, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSUMMARY OF 2024 RESULTS ##TABLE_START Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2024 2023 Change vs. Prior Year Net sales $ 84,039 &#160; $ 82,006 2 % Operating income 18,545 &#160; 18,134 2 % Net earnings 14,974 &#160; 14,738 2 % Net earnings attributable to Procter &#38; Gamble 14,879 &#160; 14,653 2 % Diluted net earnings per common share 6.02 &#160; 5.90 2 % Core earnings per share 6.59 &#160; 5.90 12 % Cash flow from operating activities 19,846 &#160; 16,848 18 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#8226; Net sales increased 2% to $84.0 billion versus the prior year. The net sales growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric &#38; Home Care and Grooming and a low single-digit increase in Beauty. Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Grooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &#38; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care. \n\n&#8226; Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset. \n\n&#8226; Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million. \n\n&#8226; Net earnings attributable to Procter &#38; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion. \n\n&#8226; Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the Gillette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59. \n\n&#8226; Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion. \n\n&#9702; Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion. \n\n&#9702; Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%. \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 19 \n\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTI ES \n\nGlobal Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024. \n\nForeign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. \n\nCommodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. \n\nGovernment Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy&#8221;. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance. \n\nFor additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&#38;A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S. \n\nFor most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG&#38;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&#38;A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts. \n\n20 The Procter &#38; Gamble Company \n\nFor a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2023 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&#38;A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 . \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet sales increased 2% to $84.0 billion in fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales was driven by higher pricing of 4%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 2%. Volume and mix were unchanged versus the prior year. \n\nNet sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, Fabric &#38; Home Care and Grooming and increased low single digits in Beauty. Net sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Grooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &#38; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care. \n\nOperating Costs ##TABLE_START Comparisons as a percentage of net sales; fiscal years ended June 30 2024 2023 Basis Point Change Gross margin 51.4 &#160; % 47.9 % 350 bps Selling, general and administrative expense 27.7 &#160; % 25.7 % 200 bps Operating margin 22.1 &#160; % 22.1 % 0 bps Earnings before income taxes 22.3 &#160; % 22.4 % (10) bps Net earnings 17.8 &#160; % 18.0 % (20) bps Net earnings attributable to Procter &#38; Gamble 17.7 &#160; % 17.9 % (20) bps ##TABLE_END\n\nGross margin increased 350 basis points to 51.4% of net sales. The increase in gross margin was due to: \n\n&#8226; a 220 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings, \n\n&#8226; 160 basis points of lower commodity costs and \n\n&#8226; a 170 basis-point increase from higher pricing. \n\nThese increases were partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; an 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, \n\n&#8226; a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, \n\n&#8226; 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and \n\n&#8226; 30 basis points of one-time manufacturing related costs including capacity startup costs. \n\nTotal SG&#38;A increased 10% to $23.3 billion due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points to 27.7% due primarily to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. \n\n&#8226; Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. \n\n&#8226; Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. \n\nProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales. \n\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOperating margin was unchanged at 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales and the non-cash impairment charge, as discussed above. \n\nOperating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above. \n\nNon-Operating Items \n\n&#8226; Interest expense was $925 million, an increase of $169 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates. \n\n&#8226; Interest income was $473 million, an increase of $166 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates. \n\n&#8226; Other non-operating income was unchanged at $668 million as gains from the sale of minor brands and an increase in net non-operating benefits on postretirement plans were fully offset by a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 21 \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe effective income tax rate for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, was 20.2%, compared to 19.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable geographic mix impacts, partially offset by decreases due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation. \n\nNet Earnings \n\nEarnings before income taxes increased $408 million, or 2%, to $18.8 billion due to the increase in operating income discussed above. Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, partially offset by the increase in the effective income tax rate discussed above. \n\nForeign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. \n\nNet earnings attributable to Procter &#38; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion. \n\nDiluted EPS increased $0.12, or 2%, to $6.02 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. \n\nSEGMENT RESULTS \n\nSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate.

Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by mid-single-digit increases in Europe and IMEA and a low single-digit increase in North America. Market share of the feminine care category increased 0.2 points. \n\n&#8226; Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased low single digits driven by a unit volume increase (due to market growth and increased marketing support) and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable product mix (due to growth of larger pack sizes with lower than category-average selling prices). Organic sales also increased low single digits. North America's share of the family care category decreased 0.4 points. \n\nNet earnings increased 13% to $4.0 billion due to a 230 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased primarily due to lower commodity costs, productivity savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing and overhead spending. \n\nCORPORATE \n\n##TABLE_START ($ millions) 2024 2023 Change vs. 2023 Net sales $601 $765 (21)% Net earnings/(loss) $(1,430) $(399) N/A ##TABLE_END\n\nCorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. \n\nCorporate net sales decreased $164 million to $601 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $1.0 billion due to a loss of $1.4 billion due primarily to the impairment charge of the Gillette intangible asset and incremental restructuring charges. \n\nRestructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings \n\nThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. \n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $659 million, which include foreign currency translation losses recognized as a non-cash charge of approximately $216 million due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Restructuring accruals of $166 million as of June 30, 2024, are classified as current liabilities. Excluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, approximately 64% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2024 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our policies for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. \n\nSavings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. \n\nCASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \n\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. \n\nOperating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 25 \n\nCash Flow Analysis \n\n##TABLE_START ($ millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,846 &#160; $ 16,848 Net cash used in investing activities (3,504) (3,500) Net cash used in financing activities (14,855) (12,146) Adjusted Free Cash Flow 16,946 &#160; 14,011 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity 105 &#160; % 95 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Cash Flow \n\nOperating cash flow was $19.8 billion in 2024, an 18% increase versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for certain non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, intangible asset impairment, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $19.3 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $533 million of cash in the period primarily driven by an increase in trade payables and other non-cash add-backs, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in post-retirement benefit accruals. The increase in trade payables is primarily from increased marketing support activities and extended payment terms with suppliers, partially offset by lower supply chain payables due to a decrease in commodity costs. Other non-cash add-backs include the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. The increase in Accounts Receivable is primarily from sales growth. The decrease in post-retirement benefit accruals is due to payments and the net periodic credit from other retiree benefits. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Days inventory on hand increased by two days. \n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. \n\nAdjusted free cash flow was $16.9 billion in 2024, an increase of 21% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105% in 2024. \n\nInvesting Cash Flow \n\nNet investing activities used $3.5 billion of cash in 2024, primarily due to capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges. \n\nFinancing Cash Flow \n\nNet financing activities used $14.9 billion of cash in 2024, mainly due to dividends to shareholders, treasury stock purchases and a net debt decrease, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other. \n\nLiquidity \n\nAt June 30, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $8.9 billion, largely due to accounts payable, short-term borrowings and debt due within one year. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $6.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. \n\nWe utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements. \n\nOn June 30, 2024, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard &#38; Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard &#38; Poor's), all with a stable outlook. \n\nWe maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2028 and October 2024, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not \n\n26 The Procter &#38; Gamble Company \n\nhave cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. \n\nContractual Commitments \n\nThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2024. ##TABLE_START ($ millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 Years RECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt $ 32,922 &#160; $ 7,220 $ 7,821 $ 4,048 $ 13,833 Leases 1,031 &#160; 244 370 227 190 \n\nU.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1) \n\n1,154 &#160; 562 592 &#8212; &#8212; OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt 5,815 &#160; 796 1,363 972 2,684 \n\nMinimum pension funding (2) \n\n506 &#160; 164 342 &#8212; &#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations (3) \n\n2,610 &#160; 1,092 910 376 232 TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS $ 44,038 &#160; $ 10,078 $ 11,398 $ 5,623 $ 16,939 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. \n\n(2) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2027 are not currently determinable. \n\n(3) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. \n\nThe Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 27 \n\nregarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. \n\nRealization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. \n\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. \n\nA core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nBecause there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes. \n\nEmployee Benefits \n\nWe sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. \n\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2024, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 6.0% and 8.5%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $145 million. \n\nSince pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $85 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.8% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $30 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have \n\n28 The Procter &#38; Gamble Company \n\nindefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. \n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge. \n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. \n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries&#8217; currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. \n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. \n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. \n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 29 \n\n##TABLE_START Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rate -50 bps Royalty Rate Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset (5)% (5)% (4)% ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible assets. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2024. \n\nOTHER INFORMATION \n\nHedging and Derivative Financial Instruments \n\nAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments. \n\nDerivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager&#8482; value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics&#8482; dataset as of June 30, 2024. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics&#8482;, a reasonable proxy is included. \n\nOur market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. \n\nInterest Rate Exposure. We are exposed to interest rate movements due to our long and short-term borrowing program. Interest rate swaps are used to manage exposures to interest rates on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments. \n\nBased on our interest rate exposure as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements. \n\nCurrency Rate Exposure. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company&#8217;s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. \n\nBased on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements. \n\nCommodity Price Exposure. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity. \n\nMeasures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP \n\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors with a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at- \n\n30 The Procter &#38; Gamble Company \n\nrisk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. \n\nOrganic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. \n\nThe following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: ##TABLE_START \n\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2024 \n\nNet Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition &#38; Divestiture \n\nImpact/Other (1) \n\nOrganic Sales Growth Beauty 1 % 2 % &#8212; % 3 % Grooming 4 % 5 % &#8212; % 9 % Health Care 5 % &#8212; % &#8212; % 5 % Fabric &#38; Home Care 4 % 1 % &#8212; % 5 % Baby, Feminine &#38; Family Care &#8212; % 2 % &#8212; % 2 % TOTAL COMPANY 2 &#160; % 2 &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % 4 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Acquisition &#38; Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. \n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. \n\nThe following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending U.S. Tax Act Payments Adjusted Free Cash Flow 2024 $ 19,846 &#160; $ (3,322) $ 422 &#160; $ 16,946 &#160; 2023 $ 16,848 $ (3,062) $ 225 $ 14,011 ##TABLE_END\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&#38;G&#8217;s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. \n\nThe following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Adjusted Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Adjustments to Net Earnings (1) \n\nNet Earnings as Adjusted Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity 2024 $ 16,946 &#160; $ 14,974 &#160; $ 1,242 &#160; $ 16,216 &#160; 105 &#160; % 2023 $ 14,011 $ 14,738 $ &#8212; $ 14,738 95 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the after-tax Gillette intangible asset impairment charge ($1.0 billion) and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses ($216) due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. \n\nCore EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: \n\n&#8226; Incremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges. \n\nThe Procter &#38; Gamble Company 31 \n\n&#8226; Intangible asset impairment: As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. \n\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides \n\na more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in \n\ndetermining their at-risk compensation. \n\n##TABLE_START THE PROCTER &#38; GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024 Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 Amounts in millions except per share amounts As Reported (GAAP) Incremental Restructuring Intangible Impairment Core (Non-GAAP) As Reported \n\n(GAAP) (1) \n\nCost of products sold $ 40,848 $(70) $ &#8212; $ 40,778 $ 42,760 Selling, general and administrative expense 23,305 (33) &#8212; 23,273 21,112 Operating income 18,545 103 1,341 19,988 18,134 Non-operating income, net 668 248 &#8212; 916 668 Income taxes 3,787 (25) 315 4,077 3,615 Net earnings attributable to P&#38;G 14,879 376 1,026 16,281 14,653 Core EPS \n\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2) \n\n$ 6.02 $ 0.15 $ 0.42 $ 6.59 $ 5.90 (1) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for Core EPS. \n\n(2) Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter &#38; Gamble. \n\nCHANGE VERSUS YEAR AGO Net earnings attributable to P&#38;G 2 % Core net earnings attributable to P&#38;G 11 % Diluted net earnings per common share 2 % Core EPS 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 245, "Negative": 299, "Polarity": -0.09926470569988105, "Subjectivity": 0.07352344910480829}, "similarity_score": 0.9917959203196879, "nlp_result": 0.14104751335537952}
