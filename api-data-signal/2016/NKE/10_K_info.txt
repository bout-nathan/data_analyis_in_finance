Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites and mobile applications (which we refer to collectively as our &#8220;Direct to Consumer&#8221; or &#8220;DTC&#8221; operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, &#8220;must have&#8221; products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail, online and through mobile applications. \n\nIn June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE will drive growth &#8212; by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections. \n\nIn addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nExpanding gross margin by: \n\n##TABLE_END - &#32;Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers; \n\n- &#32;Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; \n\n- &#32;Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and \n\n- &#32;Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by digital commerce, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on: \n\n##TABLE_END - &#32;Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit; \n\n- &#32;Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and \n\n- &#32;Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nManaging working capital efficiency; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeploying capital effectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigh single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMid-teens earnings per share growth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigh-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nFree cash flow growing faster than net income; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. \n\n##TABLE_END Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 70 basis points, and our return on invested capital has increased from 21.9% to 34.7%. \n\nOn November 19, 2015, we announced a two -for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 &#32;percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. \n\nOur fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. Revenues &#32;grew 6% to $34.4 billion, Net income &#32;increased 13% and diluted earnings per common share grew 16% to $2.51. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth. \n\nEarnings before interest and income taxes (&#8220;EBIT&#8221;) increased 7% for fiscal 2017, driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by gross margin contraction. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse, footwear and apparel, and several key categories. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInnovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStrong category retail presentation through digital commerce and NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. \n\n##TABLE_END NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which more than offset higher full-price average selling price (ASP). At current rates, we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and Net income &#32;in fiscal 2018. \n\nConverse revenues increased 4% and EBIT declined 2%, as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lower gross margin, primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, as well as the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions. \n\nFor fiscal 2017, the growth in Net income &#32;was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than Net income &#32;due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. \n\nWhile foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. \n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations, which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company &#8217; s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations, which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) \n\nOthers include all unisex products, equipment and other products not allocated to Men&#8217;s, Women&#8217;s and Young Athletes&#8217;, as well as certain adjustments that are not allocated to products designated by gender or age. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) \n\nOthers include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 \n\nOn a constant-currency basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues &#32;grew 8% for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2017 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China, Western Europe, Emerging Markets and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues . \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales. \n\nThe constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men&#8217;s Training and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced DTC business. \n\nWhile wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as NIKE-owned digital commerce. For fiscal 2017, DTC revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites and mobile applications, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016. \n\nOn a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Men&#8217;s revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes' business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. \n\nFiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues &#32;grew 12% for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand. Every NIKE Brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues , while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central &#38; Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point. \n\nOn a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. \n\nThe constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men&#8217;s Training, Running, Women&#8217;s Training and Football (Soccer). Apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business. \n\nFor fiscal 2016, DTC revenues represented approximately 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 23% in fiscal 2015. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. Digital commerce sales grew 59% in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, digital commerce sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues compared to 18% for fiscal 2015. \n\nOn a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Men&#8217;s revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, while Women&#8217;s revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Women&#8217;s Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes&#8217; business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. \n\nFutures Orders \n\nFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 totaled $ 14.7 billion , 2% &#32;lower than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. \n\nBy geography, futures orders were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReported Futures Orders \n\n&#160; \n\nExcluding Currency Changes (1) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nGreater China \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nJapan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nFutures orders have been calculated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n##TABLE_END Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley. \n\nGross Margin \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nGross profit \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,312 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,971 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,067 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGross margin \n\n&#160; \n\n44.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n46.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(160) bps \n\n&#160; \n\n46.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n20 bps \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 \n\nFor fiscal 2017, our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the following factors: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products to the consumer; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 100 basis points) as an increase in the mix of higher cost products and labor input cost inflation more than offset lower material input costs; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUnfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLower NIKE Brand DTC margins (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points) reflecting the impact of higher off-price sales. \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2016, our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015, primarily attributable to the following factors: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products with higher prices and, to a lesser extent, due to price increases reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGrowth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) as shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation were only partially offset by lower material input costs; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigher off-price mix (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points), primarily reflecting the impacts from clearing excess inventory in North America; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUnfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily due to higher product design and development costs; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily resulting from shifts in mix to lower-margin products. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTotal Selling and Administrative Expense \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nDemand creation expense (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,341 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,278 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,213 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOperating overhead expense \n\n&#160; \n\n7,222 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,191 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6,679 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal selling and administrative expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,563 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,469 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,892 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n% of revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n30.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n32.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(150) bps \n\n&#160; \n\n32.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 \n\nDemand creation expense &#32;increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship.

For fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense &#32;by approximately 6 percentage points. \n\nOperating overhead expense &#32;increased 8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, as well as higher wage-related expenses and investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower variable compensation.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. \n\nEach NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central &#38; Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company&#8217;s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. \n\nAs part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories &#32;and Cost of sales &#32;for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity&#8217;s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. \n\nThe breakdown of revenues is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes (1) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,764 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,740 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nWestern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n6,211 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,884 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n1,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,431 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nGreater China \n\n&#160; \n\n4,237 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,785 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,067 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nJapan \n\n&#160; \n\n1,014 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nEmerging Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n3,995 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3,898 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nGlobal Brand Divisions (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTotal NIKE Brand Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n32,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n30,507 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n28,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nConverse \n\n&#160; \n\n2,042 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,955 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,982 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nCorporate (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(86 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(82 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTOTAL NIKE, INC.

DTC revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%. The broader retail marketplace in North America is being impacted by several significant trends, including shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels, retail consolidation and a promotional environment. \n\nFootwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix. \n\nThe increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in several other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP. \n\nEBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our DTC business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing DTC business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs. \n\nFiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nOn a constant-currency basis, North America revenues increased 8% primarily due to growth in our Sportswear, Jordan Brand and Running categories. DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%. \n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. \n\nApparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP. \n\nEBIT increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operations and bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was partially offset by lower variable compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate than revenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense. \n\nWestern Europe \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,068 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,985 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,876 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n1,868 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,628 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,552 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,211 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,884 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales to Wholesale Customers \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,443 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,429 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,451 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSales Direct to Consumer \n\n&#160; \n\n1,768 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,455 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,211 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,884 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,203 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,434 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,275 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 &#32; \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 11%. Revenue growth was broad-based across all territories, led by Western Europe&#8217;s largest territory, the UK &#38; Ireland, which grew 11%. On a category basis, revenues increased for nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2017 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 16% and the addition of new stores. \n\nThe constant-currency increase in footwear revenues was led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines concentrated in Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2017, unit sales of footwear increased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business. \n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenue growth was due to higher revenues for nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 16%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business and higher full-price ASP. \n\nReported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by significant gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 550 basis points primarily driven by the effects of significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. &#32;Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sports marketing and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing DTC business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs. \n\nFiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nOn a constant-currency basis, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 14% with double-digit growth in every territory. Growth was led by our largest territories, the UK &#38; Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland), which grew 12% and 16%, respectively. On a category basis, revenues grew for every key category, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2016, due to strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 13%. \n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenue growth was fueled by increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 10%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix. \n\nThe constant-currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in every key category, most notably Sportswear, with Football (Soccer) also providing strong growth. Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2016 increased 11%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business and higher full-price ASP. \n\nOn a reported basis, EBIT grew 12% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro. EBIT grew at a higher rate than revenue as selling and administrative expense leverage and the favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case reflected in Other (income) expense, net , were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher off-price mix were mostly offset by higher full-price ASP, shifts in mix to lower-cost products and growth in our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead, primarily to support DTC expansion. Demand creation increased slightly as higher spending for DTC and other demand creation costs more than offset lower sports marketing costs. &#32; \n\nCentral &#38; Eastern Europe \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,431 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales to Wholesale Customers \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,237 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,215 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,241 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSales Direct to Consumer \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,431 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 &#32; \n\nOn a constant-currency basis, Central &#38; Eastern Europe revenues increased 7%, with double-digit growth in nearly every territory. Revenue growth was led by two of Central &#38; Eastern Europe's largest territories, Turkey and Russia, which each increased 14%, while revenues for our distributors business decreased 9%. On a category basis, revenue growth was fueled by higher revenues, primarily in Sportswear, which more than offset declines in several other categories. DTC revenues increased 19%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 9%, the addition of new stores and digital commerce sales growth. \n\nThe constant-currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to higher Sportswear revenues, partially offset by declines in most other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 7%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher off-price and DTC ASPs. \n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to growth in Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. ASP per unit increased as lower full-price ASP resulting from higher discounts was more than offset by the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business. \n\nReported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 490 basis points primarily due to significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher demand creation expense driven by higher advertising and sports marketing costs, partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily due to lower administrative and variable compensation costs, partially offset by continued investments in our DTC business. \n\nFiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2016 revenues for Central &#38; Eastern Europe increased 17%, with double-digit growth in nearly every territory. Revenue growth was led by two of our largest territories, Turkey and Russia, which increased 26% and 18%, respectively, while our distributors business also grew 16%. Revenues grew in nearly every key category, driven by Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer). DTC revenues increased 46%, fueled by comparable store sales growth of 27% and the addition of new stores. \n\nConstant-currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear and Running. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 7%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 16 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, largely reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories. \n\nThe currency-neutral growth in apparel revenue in fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales of apparel decreased 2% for fiscal 2016. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 11 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, largely reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories. \n\nOn a reported basis, EBIT increased 16% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Russian Ruble and Turkish Lira. EBIT grew faster than reported revenues due to significant gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 140 basis points as significantly higher full-price ASP, warehousing efficiencies and the favorable impact of a higher proportion of revenues from our higher-margin DTC business more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and shifts in mix to higher-cost products. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead to support DTC expansion and higher demand creation expense due to increased sports marketing costs and spending to support brand events. \n\nGreater China \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFootwear \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,920 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,599 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApparel \n\n&#160; \n\n1,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,055 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEquipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,237 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,785 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,067 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nRevenues by: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales to Wholesale Customers \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,774 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,623 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,234 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSales Direct to Consumer \n\n&#160; \n\n1,463 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,162 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTOTAL REVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,237 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,785 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,067 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,507 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,372 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 &#32; \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 17%, driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand.

Unit sales of footwear increased 21%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points as higher off-price ASP was more than offset by lower DTC ASP and unfavorable off-price mix. \n\nThe currency-neutral apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was due to higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 15% and higher ASP per unit increased apparel revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points. The increase in ASP per unit was attributable to higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower ASP in our DTC business and unfavorable off-price mix. \n\nDespite the negative impact of translation, reported EBIT increased 10% for fiscal 2017 driven by higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin contracted 240 basis points primarily due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead to support DTC growth. Demand creation expense also increased as higher marketing costs more than offset lower retail brand presentation and sports marketing expenses. \n\nFiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 27%, driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand.

Fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was due to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. \n\nOn a reported basis, EBIT increased 9%, despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso and Korean Won, as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, lower warehousing and obsolescence costs, and growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis, but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our DTC business and higher wage-related and variable compensation expenses were more than offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Demand creation expense increased due to higher advertising and digital brand marketing expenses. \n\nConverse \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,042 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,955 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,982 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn territories we define as &#8220;direct distribution markets&#8221; Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors and wholesale customers, and to consumers through DTC operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. \n\nFiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 \n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e. markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America. \n\nReported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Operating overhead increased as higher wage-related expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs. \n\nFiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nExcluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Converse revenues increased 2% for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 3 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distribution market revenue growth. On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America. \n\nReported EBIT for Converse decreased 6% for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, shifts in mix to higher-cost products and higher off-price mix more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation, which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to higher wage-related expenses. \n\nCorporate \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(86 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(82 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(724 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,173 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,097 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCorporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. \n\nThe Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses. \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments. \n\nFiscal 2017 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2016 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2017, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes decreased $449 million primarily due to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na beneficial change of $280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na beneficial change of $115 million, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nan increase in net foreign currency gains of $54 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net. \n\n##TABLE_END Fiscal 2016 &#32;Compared to Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nFor fiscal 2016, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $76 million primarily due to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nan increase of $179 million, primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na beneficial change of $76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na beneficial change of $27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars. \n\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (&#8220;NTC&#8221;) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nTransactional Exposures \n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProduct Costs &#8212; NIKE&#8217;s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1. \n\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START a. \n\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START b. \n\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. \n\n##TABLE_END In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. \n\n##TABLE_START 2. \n\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories&#8217; foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (&#8220;factory currency exposure index&#8221;) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (&#8220;factory input costs&#8221;) are denominated. \n\n##TABLE_END For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories &#32;and is recognized in Cost of sales &#32;when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. \n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthe ning U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE&#8217;s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales &#8212; A portion of our Western Europe and Central &#38; Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther Costs &#8212; Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through &#160; Other (income) expense, net . Refer to Note 16 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities &#8212; Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net &#32;within our consolidated results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_END Managing Transactional Exposures \n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above. \n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net &#32;and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#8212; Fair Value Measurements &#32;and Note 16 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. \n\nTranslational Exposures \n\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries&#8217; non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income &#32;within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders&#8217; Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues &#32;was a detriment of approximately $542 million and $1,985 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes &#32;was a detriment of approximately $115 million and $449 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nManaging Translational Exposures \n\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \n\nRefer to Note 6 &#8212; Fair Value Measurements &#32;and Note 16 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. \n\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net &#32;had an unfavorable impact of approximately $59 million and $423 million on our Income before income taxes &#32;for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nNet Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries \n\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2017 and 2016. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016. \n\n##TABLE_START Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCash Flow Activity \n\nCash provided by operations &#32;was $3,640 million &#32;for fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $3,096 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 . Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $4,781 million &#32;of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $4,676 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 . Our fiscal 2017 &#32;change in working capital was a cash outflow &#32;of $1,141 million &#32;compared to an outflow &#32;of $1,580 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 . The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities. For fiscal 2017, cash collateral received from counterparties, which is recorded in Accrued liabilities &#32;on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, decreased $105 million compared to a decrease of $863 million during fiscal 2016. Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16 &#8212; Risk Management and Derivatives &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a $486 million increase in Accounts Receivable, net &#32;driven by higher revenues. \n\nCash used by investing activities &#32;was $1,008 million &#32;for fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $1,034 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 , driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment. During fiscal 2017 , the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $118 million &#32;compared to an outflow of $57 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 . This change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of $150 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 &#32;which did not recur in fiscal 2017 . Additions of property, plant and equipment were $1,105 million &#32;in fiscal 2017 compared to $1,143 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 . \n\nIn fiscal 2018, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, new DTC stores, and expanding our digital capabilities. We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4% of revenues, on average. \n\nCash used by financing activities &#32;was $1,942 million &#32;for fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $2,671 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 . The decrease in Cash used by financing activities &#32;was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. \n\nIn fiscal 2017 , we purchased 59.7 million &#32;shares of NIKE&#8217;s Class B Common Stock for $3,249 million &#32;(an average price of $ 54.43 &#32;per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2017, we had repurchased 79.8 million &#32;shares at a cost of approximately $4,437 million &#32;(an average price of $55.63 &#32;per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nOn October 21, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046. The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion at a 2.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2026. The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2046. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $1,493 million. Refer to Note 8 &#8212; Long-Term Debt &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on Long-term debt . \n\nOn August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2017 &#32;and 2016 , we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility. \n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2017 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. \n\nLiquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2017 , the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $919 million. As of May 31, 2017 , there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. \n\nAs of May 31, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $6.2 billion , of which $5.8 billion &#32;was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents &#32;and Short-term investments &#32;consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2017 , the average duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 65 days. \n\nTo date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. \n\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2017 &#32;and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Description of Commitment \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, \n\n(In millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nOperating Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,672 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,905 \n\nCapital Leases and Other Financing Obligations (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-Term Debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,888 \n\nEndorsement Contracts (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n1,323 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,214 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,054 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,032 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,338 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,850 \n\nProduct Purchase Obligations (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n4,521 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,521 \n\nOther Purchase Obligations (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,915 \n\nTOTAL \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,530 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,243 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,817 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,531 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,592 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,736 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,449 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nCapital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nThe cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2017 &#32;(if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nThe amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. \n\n##TABLE_START (4) \n\nWe generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) \n\nOther purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 &#8212; Income Taxes &#32;and Note 13 &#8212; Benefit Plans &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. \n\nWe also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2017 . Refer to Note 7 &#8212; Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nOutstanding as \n\nof May 31, 2017 \n\n(In millions) \n\nNotes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand \n\n$ \n\nPayable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAs of May 31, 2017 , the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $152 million . These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company&#8217;s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. \n\n##TABLE_START New Accounting Pronouncements \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRefer to Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. \n\n##TABLE_START Critical Accounting Policies \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. \n\nBecause of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. \n\nIn some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. \n\nIn certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. \n\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination. \n\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable \n\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense &#32;in the period in which such a determination is made. \n\nInventory Reserves \n\nWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales . If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales . \n\nContingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts \n\nA significant portion of our Demand creation expense &#32;relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. \n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. \n\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense &#32;ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser&#8217;s performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense &#32;may be recorded in a future period. \n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales &#32;as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense &#32;uniformly over the contract term. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets \n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group&#8217;s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. \n\nHedge Accounting for Derivatives \n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income , rather than Net income , until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income . In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income &#32;into Net income &#32;sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income &#32;to Other (income) expense, net &#32;during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. \n\nStock-based Compensation \n\nWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense &#32;in the period when such determination is made. \n\nIn addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense . The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. \n\nWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense &#32;in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense &#32;would be reduced in the year of such determination. \n\nOn an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes &#32;excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense . The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. \n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense . \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 145, "Negative": 237, "Polarity": -0.24083769570461336, "Subjectivity": 0.041904344005934145}, "similarity_score": 0.993770692347834, "nlp_result": 0}
