Across networking, security, collaboration and the cloud, our evolving intent-based technologies are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. \n\n&#32;A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nThree Months Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue (1) \n\n$ \n\n12,133 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n48,005 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n49,247 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margin percentage \n\n62.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n63.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.9 \n\n) \n\npts \n\n63.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\npts \n\nResearch and development \n\n$ \n\n1,499 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,601 \n\n&#160; \n\n(6.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,059 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,296 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing \n\n$ \n\n2,318 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,443 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,184 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,619 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,993 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,814 \n\n&#160; \n\n9.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal R&#38;D, sales and marketing, general and administrative \n\n$ \n\n4,312 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,577 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,236 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,729 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal as a percentage of revenue \n\n35.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n36.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.7 \n\n) \n\npts \n\n35.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n36.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\npts \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(29.3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(14.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring and other charges included in operating expenses \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n992.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n182.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income as a percentage of revenue \n\n25.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n26.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.1 \n\n) \n\npts \n\n24.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n25.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8 \n\n) \n\npts \n\nIncome tax percentage \n\n23.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n17.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.7 \n\npts \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n16.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\npts \n\nNet income \n\n$ \n\n2,424 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,813 \n\n&#160; \n\n(13.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,739 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income as a percentage of revenue \n\n20.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n22.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.3 \n\n) \n\npts \n\n20.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.8 \n\n) \n\npts \n\nEarnings per share&#8212;diluted \n\n$ \n\n0.48 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.56 \n\n&#160; \n\n(14.3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.90 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.11 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#32;During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our Service Provider Video Connected Devices business (&#8220;SP Video CPE Business&#8221;). As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. The year ended July 30, 2016 &#32;included SP Video CPE Business revenue of $504 million . \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016&#8212;Financial Performance \n\nIn fiscal 2017 we delivered solid profitability and strong operating cash flows. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment, which has impacted, in particular, our NGN Routing and Switching areas. We saw weakness in the service provider customer market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area. In addition, we continued to see weakness in emerging countries in the aggregate. We experienced solid revenue growth in Security and Wireless, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions which is part of our strategy. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term. \n\nTotal revenue decreased by 3% &#32;compared with fiscal 2016 . Within total revenue, product revenue decreased 4% &#32;while service revenue increased by 3% . In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. Total company revenue for fiscal 2017 decreased 2% not including revenue from SP Video CPE products for fiscal 2016. Additionally, fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2016. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million. Total gross margin increased by 0.1 &#32;percentage points. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 0.1 &#32;percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 &#32;percentage points, driven primarily by an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2016. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 10% , driven by an 11% &#32;decrease in net income. Net income was impacted by a higher effective tax rate, as compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recognition of $448 million of net benefits to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016. These benefits were comprised of a settlement with the IRS of outstanding items related to the audit of our federal income tax returns covering the period from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&#38;D tax credit. \n\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased $1.0 billion , driven in large part by lower product revenue in the Unites States. EMEA revenue decreased by $0.3 billion , led by a product revenue decline in the United Kingdom. Revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.1 billion , led by service revenue growth in this segment. We saw revenue declines in many emerging countries across the world during fiscal 2017. The &#8220;BRICM&#8221; countries experienced a product revenue decline of 7% in the aggregate, driven by declines in the emerging countries of Mexico, China and Brazil of 28%, 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by increased product revenue in Russia and India of 20% and 11%, respectively. \n\nFrom a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines in the service provider and the public sector markets and, to a lesser extent, in the commercial market. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. The decline in the service provider market was driven in part by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business as well as ongoing weakness in the service provider market. \n\nFrom a product category perspective, total company product revenue decreased 4% . This decrease was led by product revenue decreases in Switching and NGN Routing of 5% &#32;and 4% , respectively. The decline in sales of our Switching products was primarily due to lower sales of switches used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our Switching portfolio. We believe the decline in sales of Switching products used in campus environments was driven both by uncertainty in the macro environment, which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. Product revenue from Service Provider Video, Data Center and Collaboration decreased by 45% , 4% &#32;and 2% , respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases was product revenue growth in Security and Wireless, which grew by 9% &#32;and 5% , respectively. \n\nFourth Quarter Snapshot \n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , total revenue decreased by 4% . Within the total revenue, product revenue decreased 5% &#32;while service revenue increased by 1% . With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas and EMEA each decreased by 6% , while APJC had revenue growth of 6% . From a product category perspective, total product revenue decrease was driven by revenue decreases from Switching and NGN Routing products, with each decreasing 9% year over year. Total gross margin decreased by 0.9 &#32;percentage points. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.7 &#32;percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.1 &#32;percentage points. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 14% &#32;from the prior year, primarily as a result of a 14% &#32;decrease in net income. \n\nStrategy and Priorities &#32; \n\nAs our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, we believe the network is becoming more critical than ever. We believe that our customers are looking for intelligent networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics. Our vision is to deliver a highly secure, intelligent, platform for digital businesses. Our strategic priorities include accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network, and delivering technology the way our customers want to consume it. \n\nFor a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business. \n\nOther Key Financial Measures \n\nThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2017 &#32;compared with fiscal 2016 &#32;(in millions, except annualized inventory turns): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\nCash and cash equivalents and investments \n\n&#160; \n\n$70,492 \n\n&#160; \n\n$65,756 \n\nCash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$13,876 \n\n&#160; \n\n$13,570 \n\nDeferred revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n$18,494 \n\n&#160; \n\n$16,472 \n\nRepurchases of common stock&#8212;stock repurchase program \n\n&#160; \n\n$3,706 \n\n&#160; \n\n$3,918 \n\nDividends \n\n&#160; \n\n$5,511 \n\n&#160; \n\n$4,750 \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,616 \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,217 \n\nAnnualized inventory turns \n\n&#160; \n\n12.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.6 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. &#32;Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDelivery has occurred. &#32;Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. For software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe fee is fixed or determinable. &#32;We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCollectibility is reasonably assured. &#32;We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer&#8217;s payment history. \n\n##TABLE_END In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. \n\nThe amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting. Our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition , deliverables within the scope of ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, &#32;or a combination of both. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in ASC 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. \n\nAs our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2017 , nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. \n\nWe make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. Distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. \n\nAllowances for Receivables and Sales Returns \n\nThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPercentage of gross accounts receivable \n\n&#160; \n\n3.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\nAllowance for credit loss&#8212;lease receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPercentage of gross lease receivables (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.6 \n\n% \n\nAllowance for credit loss&#8212;loan receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPercentage of gross loan receivables \n\n&#160; \n\n2.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#32; Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income. \n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer&#8217;s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer&#8217;s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. \n\nThe allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer&#8217;s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. \n\nA reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 &#32;was $122 million &#32;and $126 million , respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. \n\nInventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers \n\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. \n\nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 29, 2017 , the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million , compared with $159 million &#32;as of July 30, 2016 , and was included in other current liabilities. \n\nOur provision for inventory was $74 million , $65 million , and $54 million &#32;in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $124 million , $134 million , and $102 million &#32;in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. \n\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. \n\nLoss Contingencies and Product Warranties \n\nWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. \n\nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nIn fiscal 2014, we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million resulting from failures related to products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. We perform regular assessments of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by $74 million and $164 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively based on updated analyses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we further reduced the liability by $141 million &#32;to reflect lower than expected defects, actual usage history, and estimated lower future remediation costs as more of the impacted products age and near the end of the support period covered by the remediation program. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $125 million &#32;charge to product cost of sales related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products. The liabilities related to the supplier component remediation matters as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 &#32;was $174 million &#32;and $276 million , respectively. \n\nEstimating these liabilities is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liabilities for these matters may be impacted. \n\nOur products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities. \n\nIf we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $58.8 billion &#32;as of July 29, 2017 , compared with $58.1 billion &#32;as of July 30, 2016 . Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 29, 2017 , consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value. \n\nOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2017 and 2016 , to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. \n\nThe inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 29, 2017 . &#32; Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 . \n\nOther-than-Temporary Impairments \n\nWe recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. \n\nIf the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral. \n\nFor publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nWe also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 29, 2017 , our investments in privately held companies were $983 million , compared with $1,003 million &#32;as of July 30, 2016 , and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. \n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments \n\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. \n\nThe goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 &#32;was $29.8 billion &#32;and $26.6 billion , respectively. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2017 &#32;was due in large part to our acquisition of AppDynamics. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 . For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2017 , the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was &#32; $46.8 billion for the Americas, $25.1 billion for EMEA, and $20.9 billion for APJC. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. \n\nThe fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. \n\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $47 million , $74 million , and $175 million &#32;during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&#38;D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 21.8% , 16.9% , and 19.8% &#32;in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. \n\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. \n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&#38;D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the United States, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nRevenue \n\nThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nRevenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,549 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(496 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.3 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n74.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n75.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n76.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nService \n\n&#160; \n\n12,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,993 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.1 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n25.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n23.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n48,005 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n49,247 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n49,161 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,242 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments.

Fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less extra week. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services subscriptions, and $65 million from our SaaS offerings such as WebEx, and a small amount from product distribution. Our total revenue declined in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments, while revenue grew in our APJC geographic segment. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 7% product revenue decline, with revenue declines in Mexico, China, and Brazil partially offset by increases in the other two BRICM countries. \n\nIn addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 &#32; \n\nTotal revenue was flat. Total company revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased 3%. Product revenue decreased by 1% in total, but increased by 2% for product revenue not including SP Video CPE products. Service revenue increased by 5%. Fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015, thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week, the impact of which is discussed above. Our total revenue grew in our APJC geographic segment, while revenue declined in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 3% product revenue growth, with growth in China, India and Mexico, partially offset by decreases in the other two BRICM countries. Our revenue in fiscal 2016 was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries, although the indirect effects are difficult to measure. \n\nProduct Revenue by Segment \n\nThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nProduct revenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,663 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,231 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,176 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(568 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.6 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n57.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n58.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n58.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEMEA \n\n&#160; \n\n9,369 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,682 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,882 \n\n&#160; \n\n(313 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(200 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.0 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n26.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n26.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n26.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAPJC \n\n&#160; \n\n5,849 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,909 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,637 \n\n&#160; \n\n(60 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n16.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n15.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n14.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,549 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(496 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.3 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. &#32; As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. SP Video CPE Business revenue was $504 million &#32;and $1,846 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n\nAmericas \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nThe 5% &#32;decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment was driven by declines in the service provider, public sector and commercial markets. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. The product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in large part by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2017. We had $378 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. The product revenue decline in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments and to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the United States, 28% in Mexico and 7% in Brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in Canada. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe decrease in product revenue for the Americas segment was driven by a decline of $1,146 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased for the Americas segment. From a customer markets perspective, the decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment of 3% &#32;was led by a significant decline in the service provider market driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. We experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets. The product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to state and local governments, partially offset by lower sales to the U.S. federal government. &#32; From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 34% in Brazil and 24% in Canada partially offset by a slight increase in the United States and an increase of 3% in Mexico. \n\nEMEA \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nProduct revenue in the EMEA segment decreased by 3% , driven by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and enterprise markets. Product revenue in the commercial market was flat. The product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in part by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2017. We had $108 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment each decreased by 3%. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe decrease in product revenue of 2% , or $200 million , for the EMEA segment was driven by a decline of $164 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business. From a customer market perspective, the decrease was driven by product revenue declines in the service provider, public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. The decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 11%, led by a decline in Russia of 31%. Product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, increased by 1%. \n\nAPJC \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nProduct revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 1% . The product revenue decrease was led by declines in the service provider and public sector markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 12% in China, driven by a decrease in sales of Service Provider Video software and solutions products, while product revenue increased by 11% in India, 9% in Australia and 2% in Japan. Product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by an $18 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our SP Video CPE Business. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe increase in product revenue in the APJC segment of 5% &#32;was led by solid growth in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, growth in the enterprise, public sector and commercial markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 22% in China, driven by an increase in sales of Service Provider Video software and solutions products, and 18% in India, partially offset by product revenue decreases of 7% in Japan and 5% in Australia. Product revenue for this geographic segment was adversely impacted by a $32 million decrease in product revenue related to the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. \n\nProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar Products \n\nIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories: Switching; NGN Routing; Collaboration; Data Center; Wireless; Security; Service Provider Video; and Other Products. \n\nThe following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nProduct revenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSwitching \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,949 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,700 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,712 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(751 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(12 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n39.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n39.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n39.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNGN Routing \n\n&#160; \n\n7,831 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,133 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,343 \n\n&#160; \n\n(302 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(210 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n22.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCollaboration \n\n&#160; \n\n4,278 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,352 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,004 \n\n&#160; \n\n(74 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n12.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n10.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nData Center \n\n&#160; \n\n3,228 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,365 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,219 \n\n&#160; \n\n(137 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n9.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n9.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n8.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWireless \n\n&#160; \n\n2,766 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,640 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,551 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n7.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n7.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurity \n\n&#160; \n\n2,153 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,969 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,747 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.7 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n6.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nService Provider Video (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,734 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n(788 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(45.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,207 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(41.0 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n7.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n53.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n54.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of product revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,549 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(496 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.3 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#32;During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. As a result, fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from SP Video CPE Business. SP Video CPE Business revenue was $504 million &#32;and $1,846 million &#32;for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period&#8217;s presentation. \n\nSwitching \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nThe decrease in revenue in our Switching product category of 5% , or $751 million , was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Switching products used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our Switching portfolio. We believe this was driven both by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in sales of our ACI portfolio which is included in our data center switching portfolio. \n\nIn terms of subcategories, the decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 18%, or $784 million and the decrease in sales of storage products of 22%, or $95 million were partially offset by increased revenue from our LAN fixed-configuration switches of 1%, or $128 million. Revenue from our modular switches decreased driven by lower sales of most of the Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, partially offset by growth in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches within this product category. Revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches increased due to higher sales of our Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nWe believe the flat revenue in our Switching product category was driven in large part by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending. This led to flat revenue in our Switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of revenue within this product category. We also experienced decreased revenue from storage products. \n\nThese impacts were offset by an increase in sales of our Switching products used in data centers, reflecting strength in our ACI portfolio. \n\nIn terms of subcategories, the increase in revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches of 5%, or $452 million was substantially offset by decreased revenue from our modular switches of 8%, or $375 million, and the decreased revenue from storage products of 17%, or $89 million. Revenue from our LAN-fixed configuration switches increased due primarily to higher sales of our Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio. Decreased revenue from our modular switches was due primarily to lower sales of most of our Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and also due to lower sales of our Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, partially offset by sales growth in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches within this product category. \n\nNGN Routing \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nRevenue in our NGN Routing product category decreased by 4% , or $302 million , driven by an 8%, or $211 million, decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products and a 5%, or $208 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products. These declines were partially offset by a 10%, or $117 million, increase in revenue from other NGN Routing products. Revenue from our midrange and low-end router products decreased due to lower sales of our Cisco ISR products and certain of our access router products. The decrease in revenue from high-end router products was driven by a decrease in revenue from our mobility products within our ASRs and from our CRS products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products increased due to higher sales of cable access products and certain optical networking products. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nWe believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in NGN Routing. Revenue in this product category decreased by 3% , or $210 million , driven by an 8%, or $378 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products partially offset by a 12%, or $126 million, increase in revenue from what we categorize as other NGN Routing products and a 2%, or $42 million, increase in revenue from our mid-range and low-end router products. Revenue from high-end router products decreased due to a decrease in revenue from most of our high-end router products, partially offset by higher sales of our CRS-X products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products increased due to higher sales of optical networking products. The revenue increase in the mid-range and low-end routers was primarily driven by higher sales of Cisco ISR products. \n\nCollaboration \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nRevenue from our Collaboration product category decreased by 2% , or $74 million , driven by a decrease in sales of Cisco Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence products, partially offset by continued growth in Conferencing revenue. The decrease in Unified Communications revenue was driven primarily by decreased revenue from phones. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products declined due to lower revenue from endpoint products. The growth in Conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring SaaS revenue from WebEx, which we include as product revenue in this category. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Collaboration product category. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nRevenue from our Collaboration product category increased by 9% , or $348 million , driven by growth across the various subcategories within this product category. The growth in Conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from WebEx. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products grew due to higher revenue in infrastructure and endpoint products as a result of new product introductions. The increase in Unified Communications revenue was driven by higher software revenue. \n\nData Center \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nRevenue in our Data Center product category decreased by 4% , or $137 million , driven by a decrease in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products, with declines in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets partially offset by growth in the service provider market. We believe that both the uncertainty in the macro environment and the continued market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems continued to affect customer spending. The decrease in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products was partially offset by an increase in sales of our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe increase in revenue in our Data Center product category of 5% , or $146 million , was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products, with growth across all geographic segments and most of the customer markets. We believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending for products in this category and we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems. \n\nWireless \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nRevenue in our Wireless product category increased by 5% , or $126 million , due primarily to continued growth in sales of Meraki products within this product category, and an increase in sales of certain of our access point products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controller products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Wireless product category. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nRevenue in our Wireless product category increased by 3% , or $89 million , due primarily to continued growth in sales of Meraki products within this category, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controllers products. \n\nSecurity \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nRevenue in our Security product category increased 9% , or $184 million , driven by higher sales of unified threat management products, advanced threat security products, and web security products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nRevenue in our Security product category increased 13% , or $222 million , driven by higher sales of advanced threat security, web security and unified threat management products. \n\nService Provider Video \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nThe decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 45% , or $788 million , was driven by a decrease in product sales of $504 million &#32;related to our SP Video CPE Business and a decrease in revenue from our video software and solutions products, particularly in China. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 41% , or $1,207 million , was driven by a decrease in product sales of $1,342 million related to our SP Video CPE Business which we sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from certain cable access products and an increase in revenue from our video software and solutions products, particularly in China. \n\nOther Products \n\nThe increase in revenue in our Other Products category for fiscal 2017 was in large part due to increased revenue from our IoT products, driven by our fiscal 2016 Jasper acquisition. The acquisition of AppDynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in revenue in this product category. The increase in revenue for fiscal 2016 was due to increased revenue from data and analytics offerings, from our cloud-related offerings and from our IoT products, driven by our Jasper acquisition. \n\nService Revenue by Segment \n\nThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\nYears Ended \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nService revenue: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n$ \n\n7,864 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,729 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,395 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of service revenue \n\n63.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEMEA \n\n2,635 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,620 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,466 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.2 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of service revenue \n\n21.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAPJC \n\n1,801 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,644 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,550 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.1 \n\n% \n\nPercentage of service revenue \n\n14.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n13.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n12,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,993 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5.1 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nService revenue grew 3% . Excluding the $200 million of additional revenue as a result of the extra week in fiscal 2016, service revenue grew 4%. Service revenue grew across all of our geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 3% and advanced services revenue increased by 1%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. The increase in technical support services revenue was driven by contract initiations and renewals associated with product sales and an increase in software support offerings. Advanced services revenue, which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs, had solid revenue growth in our APJC segment, declined slightly in our EMEA segment and was flat in our Americas segment. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nService revenue grew 5% , which includes a $200 million, or 2%, year-over-year increase as a result of the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Service revenue had solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 5% and advanced services revenue increased by 7%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue grew across all geographic segments. \n\nGross Margin \n\nThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nAMOUNT \n\n&#160; \n\nPERCENTAGE \n\nYears Ended \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\nGross margin: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct \n\n$ \n\n22,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,093 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,373 \n\n&#160; \n\n61.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n59.3 \n\n% \n\nService \n\n8,218 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,867 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,308 \n\n&#160; \n\n66.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n65.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.0 \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n30,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,960 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,681 \n\n&#160; \n\n63.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nProduct Gross Margin \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2016 &#32;to fiscal 2017 : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Gross Margin Percentage \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\nProduct pricing \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.1 \n\n)% \n\nMix of products sold \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n)% \n\nSupplier component remediation adjustment \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\nProductivity (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\nSP Video CPE Business impact \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160;% \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n61.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere. \n\nProduct gross margin decreased by 0.4 &#32;percentage points as compared with fiscal 2016 . The decrease in product gross margin was largely due to unfavorable impacts from product pricing, lower productivity benefits, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a benefit from the divestiture of the lower margin SP Video CPE business in fiscal 2016. \n\nThe negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. While productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components which are currently constrained. We expect the higher costs related to the constraint on these memory components to continue to impact productivity in the near term. In addition, productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in core routing and switching revenue which limited our ability to generate cost savings. Productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes), lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. The decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our NGN Routing, Switching and IoT products. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2015 &#32;to fiscal 2016 : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Gross Margin Percentage \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n59.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\nProductivity (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\nSP Video CPE Business impact \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\nRockstar patent portfolio charge \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160;% \n\nProduct pricing \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.2 \n\n)% \n\nMix of products sold \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8 \n\n)% \n\nSupplier component remediation charge/adjustment \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nProduct gross margin increased by 2.7 &#32;percentage points compared with fiscal 2015 . The increase in product gross margin was due in large part to productivity improvements, which were driven primarily by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Our product gross margin also benefited from the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin SP Video CPE Business, lower amortization expense and impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets, and a $188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the Rockstar Consortium patent portfolio. \n\nThe various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets, an unfavorable mix of products sold and the lower supplier component remediation adjustment. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due to a negative mix impact from our Cisco Unified Computing System products, higher sales of Service Provider Video products (not including the CPE Business) and an unfavorable mix within Switching products. \n\nService Gross Margin \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nOur service gross margin percentage increased by 1.2 &#32;percentage points due to higher sales volume, decreased delivery costs, favorable mix and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. These benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. \n\nOur service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nService gross margin percentage increased by 1.6 &#32;percentage points due to higher sales volume and decreased headcount-related costs. These benefits to gross margin were partially offset by increased partner delivery costs and increased outside services costs. \n\nGross Margin by Segment \n\nThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; \n\nAMOUNT \n\n&#160; \n\nPERCENTAGE \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\nGross margin: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,284 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,986 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n64.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.9 \n\n% \n\nEMEA \n\n&#160; \n\n7,855 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,998 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,731 \n\n&#160; \n\n65.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n65.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.6 \n\n% \n\nAPJC \n\n&#160; \n\n4,741 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,620 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,313 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n61.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.0 \n\n% \n\nSegment total \n\n&#160; \n\n30,880 \n\n&#160; \n\n31,604 \n\n&#160; \n\n30,682 \n\n&#160; \n\n64.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n64.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.4 \n\n% \n\nUnallocated corporate items (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(656 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(644 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,001 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,960 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,681 \n\n&#160; \n\n63.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n62.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n60.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#32; The unallocated corporate items &#32; include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nThe Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by NGN Routing, Switching and IoT products. \n\nThe gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to higher service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment also increased slightly due to the impact of productivity improvements, the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business and a favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. \n\nThe APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due primarily to higher service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment decreased due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by our Cisco Unified Computing System products. \n\nThe gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe Americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. In this geographic segment, productivity improvements were substantially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due to increased revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and an unfavorable mix within our NGN Routing products. \n\nThe gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due primarily to increased revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment. \n\nOur APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. The mix impact was driven primarily by higher sales from our Service Provider Video products (not including the SP Video CPE Business) and unfavorable mix within our NGN Routing products. \n\nResearch and Development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (&#8220;G&#38;A&#8221;) Expenses \n\nR&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance in Percent \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,059 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,296 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,207 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(237 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n12.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n12.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n12.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing \n\n&#160; \n\n9,184 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,619 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,821 \n\n&#160; \n\n(435 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(202 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.1 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n19.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n19.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n20.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n1,993 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,814 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,040 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(226 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(11.1 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,236 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,729 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,068 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(493 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(339 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n)% \n\nPercentage of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n35.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n36.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n36.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur fiscal 2017 had one less week compared with fiscal 2016, which had an extra week. We estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $116 million of the year-over-year decrease in total operating expenses (not including share-based compensation expense). \n\nR&#38;D Expenses \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nR&#38;D expenses decreased primarily due to lower contracted services, lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. Lower headcount- related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions and the extra week in fiscal 2016. \n\nWe continue to invest in R&#38;D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&#38;D. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nR&#38;D expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in part to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and lower discretionary spending. \n\nSales and Marketing Expenses \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services, lower discretionary spending, lower acquisition-related costs and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. Lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions. The extra week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease in headcount-related expenses. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower discretionary spending and lower headcount-related expenses. The aforementioned items benefited from foreign exchange rates during fiscal 2016. Lower share-based compensation expense also contributed to the decrease. \n\nG&#38;A Expenses \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nG&#38;A expenses increased primarily due to the $253 million &#32;pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business recorded during fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower contracted services. The extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the decreased headcount-related expense. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nG&#38;A expenses decreased primarily due to the $253 million &#32;pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business and, to a lesser extent, lower contracted services and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses. The extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the increased headcount-related expenses. \n\nEffect of Foreign Currency \n\nIn fiscal 2017 , foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses by approximately $77 million , or 0.4% , compared with fiscal 2016 . In fiscal 2016 , foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&#38;D, sales and marketing, and G&#38;A expenses by approximately $567 million , or 3.1% , compared with fiscal 2015 . \n\nShare-Based Compensation Expense \n\nThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\nCost of sales&#8212;product \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nCost of sales&#8212;service \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShare-based compensation expense in cost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring and other charges \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\nShare-based compensation expense in operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n1,310 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,246 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,233 \n\nTotal share-based compensation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,529 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,458 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,440 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017 , as compared with fiscal 2016 , was due primarily to higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions. \n\nThe increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2016 , as compared with fiscal 2015 , was due primarily to the timing of restricted stock unit (RSU) grants and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, partially offset by lower net expense associated with accelerated and modified awards. \n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets \n\nThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions): ##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nOperating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring and other charges \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,173 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2017 , as compared with fiscal 2016 , due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2017, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. \n\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2016 &#32;as compared with fiscal 2015 , due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. Lower impairment charges in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease. \n\nRestructuring and Other Charges \n\nIn August 2016, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,600 &#32;employees, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $850 million . In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $756 million &#32;during fiscal 2017. These charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. We expect the restructuring action to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring action in our key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud. As a result, the overall cost savings from the restructuring action are not expected to be material for future periods. \n\nIn connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2014, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $267 million and $489 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. These charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs.

Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. \n\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 \n\nThe provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.8% &#32;for fiscal 2017 , compared with 16.9% &#32;for fiscal 2016 . The net 4.9 &#32;percentage point increase in the effective tax rates was primarily due to the recognition of a net benefit to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 related to our settlement with the IRS of all outstanding items covering fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&#38;D tax credit on December 18, 2015. \n\nFor a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 \n\nThe provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.9% &#32;for fiscal 2016 , compared with 19.8% &#32;for fiscal 2015 . The net 2.9 &#32;percentage point decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $367 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to a tax settlement with the IRS in fiscal 2016. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources. \n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments &#32; The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n11,708 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,631 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,077 \n\nFixed income securities \n\n57,077 \n\n&#160; \n\n56,621 \n\n&#160; \n\nPublicly traded equity securities \n\n1,707 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,504 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n70,492 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n65,756 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,736 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2016 &#32;to fiscal 2017 &#32;was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $13.9 billion &#32;and a net increase in debt of $5.3 billion . These sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of $5.5 billion &#32;and repurchases of common stock of $3.7 billion &#32;under the stock repurchase program, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.3 billion , the timing of settlements of investments and other of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $1.0 billion . \n\nOur total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $67.5 billion &#32;and $59.8 billion &#32;as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 , respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 &#32;was $3.0 billion &#32;and $5.9 billion , respectively. \n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. \n\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation &#32; &#32;&#32;As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock. \n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n$ \n\n13,876 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,570 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,552 \n\nAcquisition of property and equipment \n\n(964 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,146 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,227 \n\n) \n\nFree cash flow \n\n$ \n\n12,912 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,424 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,325 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this report. \n\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. \n\nThe following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDIVIDENDS \n\n&#160; \n\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM \n\n&#160; \n\nTOTAL \n\nYears Ended \n\n&#160; \n\nPer Share \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nShares \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted-Average Price per Share \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.10 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,511 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31.38 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,706 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,217 \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.94 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26.45 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,668 \n\nJuly 25, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.80 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,086 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27.22 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,234 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,320 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAny future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. \n\nAccounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nAccounts receivable, net \n\n$ \n\n5,146 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,847 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(701 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur accounts receivable net, as of July 29, 2017 &#32;decreased by approximately 12% &#32;compared with the end of fiscal 2016 , primarily due to service and product billings being more linear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. \n\nInventory Supply Chain &#32; The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nInventories \n\n$ \n\n1,616 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,217 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nAnnualized inventory turns \n\n12.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.3 \n\n) \n\nPurchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers \n\n$ \n\n4,640 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,896 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInventory as of July 29, 2017 &#32;increased by 33% &#32;from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2016 , and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 19% . On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 22% &#32;compared with the end of fiscal 2016 . The increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. The increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due to securing memory supply and procuring key components for specific product areas. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. \n\nOur finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products. \n\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. \n\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. \n\nFinancing Receivables and Guarantees &#32;&#32;The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nLease receivables, net \n\n$ \n\n2,650 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,070 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(420 \n\n) \n\nLoan receivables, net \n\n4,457 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,349 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,108 \n\nFinanced service contracts, net \n\n2,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,011 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal, net \n\n$ \n\n9,594 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,430 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,164 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinancing Receivables &#32; Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 14% &#32;primarily due to a 33% &#32;increase in loan receivables driven by an increase in financing for software arrangements. &#32; We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term. \n\nFinancing Guarantees &#32; In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. \n\nThe volume of channel partner financing was $27.0 billion , $26.9 billion , and $25.9 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 , respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.0 billion &#32;and $1.1 billion &#32;as of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 , respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 29, 2017 , the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $314 million , of which approximately $134 million &#32;was recorded as deferred revenue. \n\nBorrowings \n\nSenior Notes &#32; The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nMaturity Date \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 30, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nSenior notes: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFloating-rate notes: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThree-month LIBOR plus 0.28% \n\nMarch 3, 2017 \n\n(1) \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\nThree-month LIBOR plus 0.60% \n\nFebruary 21, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\nThree-month LIBOR plus 0.31% \n\nJune 15, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThree-month LIBOR plus 0.50% \n\nMarch 1, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThree-month LIBOR plus 0.34% \n\nSeptember 20, 2019 \n\n(2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed-rate notes: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.10% \n\nMarch 3, 2017 \n\n(1) \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,400 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.15% \n\nMarch 14, 2017 \n\n(1) \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.40% \n\nFebruary 28, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.65% \n\nJune 15, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,600 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,600 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.95% \n\nFebruary 15, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.60% \n\nFebruary 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.125% \n\nMarch 1, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.40% \n\nSeptember 20, 2019 \n\n(2) \n\n1,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.45% \n\nJanuary 15, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.45% \n\nJune 15, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.20% \n\nFebruary 28, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.90% \n\nMarch 4, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.85% \n\nSeptember 20, 2021 \n\n(2) \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.00% \n\nJune 15, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.60% \n\nFebruary 28, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.20% \n\nSeptember 20, 2023 \n\n(2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.625% \n\nMarch 4, 2024 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.50% \n\nJune 15, 2025 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.95% \n\nFebruary 28, 2026 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.50% \n\nSeptember 20, 2026 \n\n(2) \n\n1,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.90% \n\nFebruary 15, 2039 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.50% \n\nJanuary 15, 2040 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,400 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) In March 2017, we repaid senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $4.15 billion &#32;upon maturity. \n\n(2) In September 2016, we issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $6.25 billion. \n\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes.

Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America&#8217;s &#8220;prime rate&#8221; as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (&#8220;Eurocurrency Rate&#8221;), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services, LLC and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022. \n\nIn addition, on March 30, 2017 we entered into a 364-Day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on March 29, 2018. The credit agreement also provides us the option to, for a fee, convert any borrowings outstanding thereunder on March 29, 2018 to a term loan maturing no later than March 29, 2019. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the credit agreement will be based on either (i) the higher of (a) the rates on overnight Federal Funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System (i.e., Federal Funds rate) plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America&#8217;s &#8220;prime rate&#8221; as announced from time to time or (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by S&#38;P Global Rating, a business unit of Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC, and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. \n\nThese credit agreements require that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain interest coverage ratios as defined in these agreements.

Deferred product revenue increased 23% &#32;primarily due to increased deferrals related to recurring software and subscription offers. The portion of product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers grew 50%, to $5.0 billion , as of July 29, 2017 . Wireless, Security, and Collaboration were the key product category contributors to this product deferred revenue growth during the fiscal year. Deferred service revenue increased 6% &#32;driven by the timing and amount of multiyear arrangements and our focus on contract renewals and service contract attach rates. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 29, 2017 &#32;(in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD \n\nJuly 29, 2017 \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than 1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1 to 3 Years \n\n&#160; \n\n3 to 5 Years \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than 5 Years \n\nOperating leases \n\n$ \n\n1,237 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nPurchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers \n\n4,640 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,620 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther purchase obligations \n\n1,987 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSenior notes \n\n30,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,000 \n\nOther long-term liabilities \n\n1,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal by period \n\n$ \n\n39,543 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,537 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,813 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,093 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,100 \n\nOther long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments) \n\n1,521 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n41,064 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Leases &#32; For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers &#32; We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in &#8220;Inventory Supply Chain.&#8221; As of July 29, 2017 , the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million &#32;and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations &#32; Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. \n\nLong-Term Debt &#32; The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities &#32; Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,250 million &#32;and deferred tax liabilities of $271 million &#32;were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nOther Commitments \n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nInsieme Networks, Inc. &#32;&#32; In fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. This investment included $100 million &#32;of funding and a license to certain of our technology. During fiscal 2014, we acquired the remaining interests in Insieme, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which were determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme&#8217;s products. The former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately $441 million &#32;and $389 million &#32;during fiscal 2017 &#32;and fiscal 2016 , respectively. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 , we recorded compensation expense of $47 million , $160 million &#32;and $207 million , respectively, related to these milestone payments. We do not expect a material amount of future compensation expense or further milestone payments related to this acquisition. \n\nOther Funding Commitments &#32;&#32;We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $216 million &#32;as of July 29, 2017 , compared with $222 million &#32;as of July 30, 2016 . \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 29, 2017 &#32;there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. \n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. \n\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under &#8220;Financing Receivables and Guarantees.&#8221; \n\nSecurities Lending \n\nWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2017 &#32;and 2016 was $0.7 billion &#32;and $0.6 billion , respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 29, 2017 &#32;and July 30, 2016 , we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. \n\n##TABLE_START ", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 103, "Negative": 357, "Polarity": -0.5521739118431002, "Subjectivity": 0.05402865867347561}, "similarity_score": 0.9940370338309004, "nlp_result": 0}
