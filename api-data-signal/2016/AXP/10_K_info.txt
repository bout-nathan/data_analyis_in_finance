MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&#38;A) \n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW \n\nBUSINESS INTRODUCTION \n\nWe are a global services company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant Services (GMS). \n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold. The fees charged, or merchant discount, which is generally expressed as a percentage of the charge amount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the charge amount and the merchant&#146;s overall charge volume, the method of submission of charges, the timing and method of payment to the merchant and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement (e.g., domestic or global). In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for &#147;non-swiped&#148; card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Interest on loans, principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Other fees and commissions, represent foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, Card Member delinquency fees, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees, service fees and fees related to our Membership Rewards program; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Other revenue, represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees), net revenue earned on cross-border Card Member spending, insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, merchant-related fees unrelated to merchant discount, prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue, revenues related to the American Express Global Business Travel Joint Venture (the GBT JV) transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV) and other miscellaneous revenue and fees. ##TABLE_END FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS \n\nFor 2016, we reported net income of $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.65. This compared to $5.2 billion of net income and $5.05 diluted earnings per share for 2015, and $5.9 billion of net income and $5.56 diluted earnings per share for 2014. \n\n2016 results included: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A $1.1 billion ($677 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with Costco in the second quarter; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; $410 million ($266 million after tax) of net restructuring charges; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A $127 million ($79 million after tax) gain on the sale of Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnership with JetBlue in the first quarter. ##TABLE_END 2015 results included: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A $419 million ($335 million after tax) charge related to the Prepaid Services business, that was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology, plus some restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END 2014 results included: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A $719 million ($453 million after tax) gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies (Concur) in the fourth quarter; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A $626 million ($409 million after tax) gain as a result of the GBT JV transaction in the second quarter; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; $420 million ($277 million after tax) of net charges for costs related to reengineering initiatives; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A $109 million ($68 million after tax) charge related to the renewal of our partnership with Delta Air Lines (Delta) in the fourth quarter. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nNON-GAAP MEASURES \n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. \n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT \n\nIn a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment, we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In 2016, revenue was lower year-over-year, though revenue performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter. We made a record level of business-building investments during 2016 and continued to make progress on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017. In addition, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \n\nOur worldwide billings for 2016 adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates were up slightly year-over-year. Our U.S. consumer billings were down, resulting from the end of the Costco relationship in the United States in June 2016. We saw strong performance from middle market and small businesses in the United States, while spending by large corporations declined year-over-year. Internationally, our consumer and small business billings growth rates remained strong. \n\nRevenues net of interest expense for the year declined versus the prior year, primarily reflecting higher Costco-related revenues in the prior year. After excluding Costco-related revenues and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew, driven by increases in adjusted billed business, adjusted net interest income and net card fees across our premium card portfolios. \n\nCard Member loan growth was strong year-over-year and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of our customers&#146; borrowings. Provisions for losses were up modestly versus the prior year, but grew more significantly after excluding from the prior year credit costs associated with the Costco and JetBlue Card Member loan portfolios. The growth in provisions for losses was driven by both higher Card Member loans and a slight increase in delinquency and net write-off rates due to the seasoning of loans related to newer Card Members. We expect that some modest, gradual upward pressure on our delinquency and write-off rates, due primarily to this seasoning of loans related to newer Card Members, will cause provisions to grow faster than loans in 2017. \n\nTotal expenses for the year declined versus the prior year, driven by the gains on the sales of the Costco and JetBlue portfolios, which were recognized as a reduction in Other expenses, as well as a decline in rewards expense, driven by higher Costco cobrand rewards expenses included in the prior year and the shift in volumes to cash rebate cards, for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue. Marketing and promotion expenses grew significantly due to higher levels of spending on growth initiatives. Card Member services and other expenses also increased, driven by higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services such as airport lounge access and certain cobrand card benefits. We anticipate spending less on marketing and promotion in 2017. Rewards expense and Card Member services and other expenses, after excluding Costco cobrand-related costs, should continue to grow in 2017 due to higher billings and enhancements to our card product value propositions. \n\nCompetition remains intense across our businesses. While our businesses are global and diversified, to remain competitive we need to continue to demonstrate the differentiated value we deliver to merchants, customers and business partners in all aspects of our relationships. More intense competition has and will continue to impact our cost of renewing and ability to win or extend cobrand and other relationships. Throughout our business, we are focused on those products, services and relationships that offer the best value to our customers while also providing appropriate returns to our business and shareholders. \n\nFor discussion of certain legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, see &#147;Supervision and Regulation&#148; in &#147;Business.&#148; \n\n&#160;\n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nRefer to the &#147;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#148; for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section. \n\nEffective June 30, 2014, as a result of the GBT JV transaction, we deconsolidated the Global Business Travel net assets, and now offer business travel-related services through the non-consolidated joint venture, resulting in a lack of comparability between 2015 and 2014. \n\nEffective December 1, 2015, we transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to our HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 18, 2016 and June 17, 2016, we completed the sales of the JetBlue and Costco cobrand card portfolios, respectively. For the periods from December 1, 2015, through the sale completion dates, the primary impacts beyond the HFS classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which do not reflect amounts related to these HFS loans and receivables, as credit costs were reported in Other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. Other, non-credit related metrics (i.e., billed business, cards-in-force, net interest yield) reflect amounts related to the HFS portfolios through the sale completion dates. Additionally, for periods after the sale completion dates, activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the HFS portfolios are no longer included in our Consolidated Results of Operations. Specifically, these impacts include: Discount revenue from Costco in the United States for spend on all American Express cards and from other merchants for spend on the Costco cobrand card; Other fees and commissions and Interest income from Costco cobrand Card Members; and Card Member rewards expense related to the Costco cobrand card, resulting in a lack of comparability between 2016 and 2015. \n\nThe relationship of the U.S. dollar to various foreign currencies over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations. Where meaningful in describing our performance, foreign currency-adjusted amounts, which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange (FX) rates, have been provided. \n\nTABLE 1: SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;

##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Travel commissions and fees, which were previously disclosed separately on the Consolidated Statements of Income, are now included within Other fees and commissions. ##TABLE_END TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nDiscount revenue decreased $617 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco-related revenue. Both periods of comparison reflected increases in contra-discount revenues, including cash rebate rewards, which in 2015 as compared to 2014 was offset by growth in billed business. \n\n&#160;\n\nOverall, billed business was flat in 2016 compared to 2015. U.S. billed business decreased 3 percent, primarily driven by lower Costco-related volumes and non-U.S. billed business increased 6 percent (10 percent on an FX-adjusted basis). 1 \n\nThe average discount rate was 2.45 percent, 2.46 percent and 2.48 percent for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the average discount rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven primarily by growth of the OptBlue program, merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in the European Union and a prior-year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals, partially offset by the benefit to the discount rate from the decline in Costco merchant volumes in the current year. We expect the average discount rate will likely continue to decline over time due to further expansion of OptBlue, merchant negotiations and competition, volume related pricing discounts and certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors&#146; interchange rates). See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate. \n\nNet card fees increased $186 million or 7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 (increasing 5 percent on an FX-adjusted basis). 1 The increase in 2016 was driven primarily by growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. \n\nOther fees and commissions decreased $113 million or 4 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $760 million or 21 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco-related fees, partially offset by an increase in delinquency and loyalty coalition-related fees. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the GBT JV transaction, resulting in a lack of comparability between periods. \n\nOther revenues were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $956 million or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The current year included a contractual payment from a GNS partner and higher revenues from our Prepaid Services business, offset by lower revenues related to Costco, Loyalty Edge (which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016), and the GBT JV transition services agreement. The decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by gains related to the sales of investment securities in Concur and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2014. \n\nInterest income decreased $70 million or 1 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $366 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income, partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities driven by lower average investment securities. \n\nInterest expense increased $81 million or 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $84 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances, partially offset by lower average long-term debt. The decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits, partially offset by an increase in average customer deposit balances. \n\nTABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES SUMMARY \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; Change &#160; (Millions, except percentages) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2016 vs. 2015 &#160; &#160; 2015 vs. 2014 &#160; Charge card\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;$ 696 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 737 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 792 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (41 ) &#160; &#160; (6)% &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (55 ) &#160; &#160; (7)% &#160; Card Member loans\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 1,235 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,190 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,138 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 52 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Other\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 95 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61 &#160; &#160; &#160; 114 &#160; &#160; &#160; 34 &#160; &#160; &#160; 56 &#160; &#160; &#160; (53 ) &#160; &#160; (46) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; Total provisions for losses (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;$ 2,026 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1,988 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 2,044 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 38 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (56 ) &#160; &#160; (3)% &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, does not reflect the HFS portfolios. ##TABLE_END PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES \n\nCharge card provision for losses decreased $41 million or 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $55 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was driven by lower net write-offs and improved delinquencies. The decrease in 2015 reflects a reserve release versus a reserve build in 2014, partially offset by higher write-offs. \n\nCard Member loans provision for losses increased $45 million or 4 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $52 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives, resulting in higher loan balances, increased net write-offs in the current year and a slight increase in delinquencies, partially offset by the impact of the HFS portfolios, as the current year does not reflect the associated credit costs, as previously mentioned. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2014. The reserve build in 2015 was due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower write-offs and the impact related to transferring the HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS in December 2015. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues and expenses constitute non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nOther provision for losses increased $34 million or 56 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $53 million or 46 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio resulting in higher net write-offs. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. \n\nTABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; Change &#160; (Millions, except percentages) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2016 vs. 2015 &#160; &#160; 2015 vs. 2014 &#160; Marketing and promotion\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;$ 3,650 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 3,109 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 3,216 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 541 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (107 ) &#160; &#160; (3)% &#160; Card Member rewards\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 6,793 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,996 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,931 &#160; &#160; &#160; (203 ) &#160; &#160; (3) &#160; &#160; &#160; 65 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; Card Member services and other\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 1,133 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,018 &#160; &#160; &#160; 822 &#160; &#160; &#160; 115 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160; 196 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; Total marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services and other\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 11,576 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,123 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,969 &#160; &#160; &#160; 453 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 154 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; Salaries and employee benefits\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 5,259 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,976 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,095 &#160; &#160; &#160; 283 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,119 ) &#160; &#160; (18) &#160; Other, net (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 5,162 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,793 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,089 &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,631 ) &#160; &#160; (24) &#160; &#160; &#160; 704 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; Total expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;$ 21,997 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 22,892 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 23,153 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (895 ) &#160; &#160; (4)% &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (261 ) &#160; &#160; (1)% &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the HFS portfolios. ##TABLE_END EXPENSES \n\nMarketing and promotion expenses increased $541 million or 17 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $107 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 (increasing 1 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), with higher levels of spending on growth initiatives in both periods. 2 \n\nCard Member rewards expenses decreased $203 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $65 million or 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower cobrand rewards expense of $518 million, primarily reflecting lower Costco-related expenses and a shift in volumes to cash rebate cards for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue, partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products. The lower cobrand rewards expense was partially offset by higher Membership Rewards expense of $315 million, primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes, recent enhancements to U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum rewards and less of a decline in the weighted average cost (WAC) per point. The increase in 2015 was primarily driven by higher cobrand rewards expense of $199 million, driven by rate impacts as a result of cobrand partnership renewal costs, partially offset by a decrease in Membership Rewards expense of $134 million. The latter was primarily driven by slower growth in the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) and a decline in the WAC per point assumption, including the impact of the $109 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the Delta partnership renewal, partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned, driven by higher spending volumes. \n\nThe Membership Rewards URR for current program participants was 95 percent ( rounded down ) at December 31, 2016, compared to 95 percent ( rounded down ) at December 31, 2015, and 95 percent ( rounded up ) at December 31, 2014. \n\nCard Member services and other expenses increased $115 million or 11 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $196 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by increased usage of travel-related benefits. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to higher costs related to certain previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits expenses increased $283 million or 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $1.1 billion or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges in the current year. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction (resulting in a lack of comparability between periods). \n\nOther expenses decreased $1.6 billion or 24 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $704 million or 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios in the current year, as well as goodwill and technology impairment charges in the prior year. The increase in 2015 reflects the net gain from the GBT JV transaction in 2014 and the goodwill and technology impairment charges in 2015, partially offset by the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities, other FX-related activity and a litigation reserve release in 2015. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 2 &#160; Refer to footnote 1 on page 39 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nThe effective tax rate was 33.2 percent in 2016 compared to 35.0 percent in 2015 and 34.5 percent in 2014. The tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014 include benefits of $60 million, $33 million, and expenses of $40 million, respectively, related to the resolution of certain prior years&#146; items. The tax rate for 2015 also includes the impact of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge mentioned previously. The changes in tax rates primarily reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. \n\nTABLE 5: SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; Change &#160; Years Ended December 31,\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2016 vs. 2015 &#160; &#160; 2015 vs. 2014 &#160; Card billed business: (billions) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 700.4 &#160; &#160; $ 721.8 &#160; &#160; $ 688.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; Outside the United States\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 337.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 317.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 334.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Worldwide\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 1,037.5 &#160; &#160; $ 1,039.7 &#160; &#160; $ 1,022.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Total cards-in-force: (millions) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 47.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 57.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 54.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; (18) &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Outside the United States\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 62.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 60.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 57.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Worldwide\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 109.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 117.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 112.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; (7) &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Basic cards-in-force: (millions) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 37.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 44.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 42.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; (17) &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Outside the United States\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 51.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 49.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 47.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Worldwide\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 89.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 94.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 89.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6) &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Average basic Card Member spending: (dollars) (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 18,808 &#160; &#160; $ 18,066 &#160; &#160; $ 17,947 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; Outside the United States\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 13,073 &#160; &#160; $ 12,971 &#160; &#160; $ 14,070 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; (8) &#160; Worldwide Average\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 17,216 &#160; &#160; $ 16,743 &#160; &#160; $ 16,884 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; (1) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Card Member loans: (billions) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 58.3 &#160; &#160; $ 51.5 &#160; &#160; $ 62.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; &#160; (18) &#160; Outside the United States\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 7.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; (9) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Worldwide\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 65.3 &#160; &#160; $ 58.6 &#160; &#160; $ 70.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160; (17) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Average discount rate\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2.45 % &#160; &#160; 2.46 % &#160; &#160; 2.48 % &#160; &#160; Average fee per card (dollars) (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; $ 44 &#160; &#160; $ 39 &#160; &#160; $ 40 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; &#160; (3)% &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;(a) Average basic Card Member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only.

Refer to Note 25 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional discussion of the products and services by segment. \n\nEffective for the first quarter of 2016, we realigned our segment presentation to reflect the organizational changes announced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; USCS, including the proprietary U.S. Consumer Card Services business and consumer travel services in the United States; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; ICNS, including the proprietary International Consumer Card Services business, GNS business and consumer travel services outside the United States; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; GCS, including the proprietary Global Corporate Payments (GCP) business, small business services businesses in the United States and internationally (collectively, GSBS), commercial financing products and foreign exchange services operations; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; GMS, including the Global Merchant Services business and global loyalty coalition businesses. ##TABLE_END Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations, including our Prepaid Services business and the American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) operations up to June 30, 2014, and subsequent activities related to the GBT JV, are included in Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nResults of the business segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below. \n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, ICNS and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment&#146;s Card Members; within the GMS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue. \n\nNet card fees and other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. \n\nInterest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR LOSSES \n\nThe provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nMarketing and promotion expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily reflected in Corporate &#38; Other and may be allocated to the segments based on the actual expense incurred. Rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred within the segment. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment. In addition, expenses related to support services, such as technology costs, are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment. Other overhead expenses, such as staff group support functions, are allocated from Corporate &#38; Other to the other segments based on a mix of each segment&#146;s direct consumption of services and relative level of pretax income. \n\nCAPITAL \n\nEach business segment is allocated capital based on established business model operating requirements, risk measures and regulatory capital requirements. The business model operating requirements reflect the capital needed to support operations and specific balance sheet items. The risk measures reflect considerations for credit, market and operational risk. \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nAn income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to each business segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment. \n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. CONSUMER SERVICES \n\nTABLE 9: USCS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;

The decrease in discount revenue was partially offset by an increase in net card fees, resulting from growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. Billed business decreased 7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower Costco-related volumes. \n\nNet interest income decreased $164 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income and higher interest expense primarily driven by higher cost of funds, all partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased $623 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, as a result of 5 percent growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate and increases in contra-discount revenues, such as cash rebate rewards. The increase also reflected higher net interest income, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loans, partially offset by higher interest expense. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR LOSSES \n\nOverall, Provisions for losses was relatively flat. Card Member loans provision for losses increased $16 million or 2 percent, primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives resulting in higher loan balances, increased net write-offs in the current year and a slight increase in delinquencies, partially offset by the impact of the HFS portfolios as the current year does not reflect the associated credit costs. Other provision for losses increased $15 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, due to growth in the non-card lending portfolio. \n\nProvisions for losses increased $34 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a small increase in Card Member loan delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances, partially offset by a Charge card provision reserve release in 2015 versus a reserve build in 2014 and the impact related to transferring the HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS in December 2015. \n\nRefer to Table 10 for the charge card and lending write-off rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nMarketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses was relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Card Member rewards expenses, offset by increases in Marketing and promotion and Card Member services expenses. Card Member rewards expense decreased $311 million or 8 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by lower cobrand reward expense of $435 million, partially offset by an increase in Membership Rewards expense of $124 million. The decrease in cobrand reward expense was primarily driven by lower Costco-related expenses, partially offset by increased spending volumes across other \n\n&#160;\n\ncobrand card products. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes, recent enhancements to Platinum Card rewards and less of a decline in the WAC per point. Marketing and promotion expenses increased $279 million or 25 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives. Card Member services and other expenses increased $66 million or 12 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by increased usage of new benefits. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $1 billion or 33 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease primarily reflects the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios in the current year, which were recognized as an expense reduction in Other expenses, partially offset by restructuring charges in the current year. \n\nTotal expenses increased $414 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses, which reflected higher cobrand rewards expense due to higher spending volumes and rate increases (due in part to previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements). The increase also reflected higher Other expenses, primarily driven by higher spending on growth initiatives and the December 2015 valuation allowance adjustment related to the HFS portfolios mentioned previously, partially offset by lower card-related fraud losses in 2015 and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA) portfolio in 2014. \n\nTABLE 10: USCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;

It also provides travel services to consumers outside the United States. \n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nNon-interest revenues increased $158 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher discount revenue due to an increase in both proprietary and non-proprietary (i.e., GNS) billed business, as well as higher net card fees. The increase also reflected a contractual payment from a GNS partner in the second quarter of 2016. Total billed business increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increases in both proprietary and GNS cards-in-force and average spend per card. Refer to Tables 6 and 12 for additional information on billed business by region. \n\nNet interest income decreased $7 million or 1 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest income decreased $23 million or 2 percent, while FX-adjusted interest income increased 8 percent, primarily driven by higher average FX-adjusted loan balances. 3 Interest expense decreased $16 million or 7 percent, while FX-adjusted interest expense increased 4 percent driven by higher FX-adjusted funding costs. 3 \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense decreased $517 million or 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, and FX-adjusted total revenues net of interest expense increased 4 percent. 3 The increase was primarily driven by foreign exchange conversion fees and net revenues earned on cross-border Card Member spending, as well as higher net interest income and net card fees. The increase also reflected higher GNS revenues. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR LOSSES \n\nProvisions for losses increased $25 million or 8 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher net write-offs. \n\nProvisions for losses decreased $54 million or 15 percent (and decreased 1 percent on an FX-adjusted basis) in 2015 compared to 2014. 3 Refer to Table 12 for Card Member loans and receivables write-off rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nMarketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $197 million or 10 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives. \n\nTotal expenses decreased $480 million or 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher restructuring charges in 2014. \n\nIncome tax provision decreased $57 million or 26 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $26 million or 13 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The effective tax rate in all periods reflects the recurring permanent tax benefit related to the segment&#146;s ongoing funding activities outside the United States, which is allocated to ICNS under our internal tax allocation process. The effective tax rates for all periods also reflect the allocated share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior-years&#146; items.

In addition, GCS provides commercial financing products. \n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nNon-interest revenues were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Costco-related revenues. Billed business increased by 2 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. \n\nNet interest income remained flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower Costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income and higher interest expense primarily due to increased cost of funds, offset by an increase in average Card Member loans across other lending products. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense decreased $448 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our investment in Concur in 2014, partially offset by higher net interest income as a result of an increase in average Card Member loans (including Card Member loans HFS), and higher discount revenue primarily from higher U.S. small business billed business. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR LOSSES \n\nProvisions for losses increased $16 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and $19 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven in both periods by growth in the commercial financing portfolio resulting in higher net write-offs. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nMarketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $256 million or 8 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by both increased Marketing and promotion expenses as a result of higher levels of spending on growth initiatives, and higher Card Member rewards expenses resulting from higher spending volumes, partially offset by lower Costco-related rewards expenses. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses remained relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting restructuring charges and higher operating expenses, including technology development and professional fees, offset by the gains recognized in the segment on the sales of the HFS portfolios. \n\nTotal expenses increased $92 million or 2 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives, including marketing and promotion expenses, technology development and higher professional services costs, partially offset by a restructuring charge taken in 2014. \n\n&#160;\n\nTABLE 14: GCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;

Refer to &#147;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#148; for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (e) Refer to Table 8 footnote (b). ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (f) For GCP Card Member receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member&#146;s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nGLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES \n\nTABLE 15: GMS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;

GMS acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global closed-loop network. GMS also operates loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries around the world. \n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nNon-interest revenues decreased $236 million or 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of lower Costco-related revenues, as well as higher contra-revenues in the current year. \n\nNet interest income increased $26 million or 12 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GMS due to its merchant payables. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense decreased $177 million or 4 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in non-interest revenues, reflecting the impact of changes in FX rates year-over-year, as well as a reduction in the interest expense credit. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR LOSSES \n\nProvisions for losses decreased $6 million or 19 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $48 million or 61 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower net write-offs. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a merchant-related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nMarketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $62 million or 21 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by higher Marketing and promotion expenses related to our global loyalty coalition businesses in the prior year. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $56 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by growth of the OptBlue program, which does not entail merchant acquirer payments, combined with lower fraud expenses. \n\nTotal expenses decreased $180 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by a litigation reserve release in the third quarter of 2015, and a restructuring charge taken in 2014. \n\n&#160;\n\nTABLE 16: GMS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; As of or for the Years Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; Change &#160; (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) \n\n&#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2016 vs. 2015 &#160; &#160; 2015 vs. 2014 &#160; Loyalty Coalition revenue\n\n&#160; &#160;$ 410 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 378 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 383 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; (1)% &#160; Average discount rate\n\n&#160; &#160; 2.45 % &#160; &#160; 2.46 % &#160; &#160; 2.48 % &#160; &#160; Total segment assets (billions) \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 24.3 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 23.5 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 17.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32 &#160; Segment capital (billions) \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 2.5 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 2.4 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 2.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; Return on average segment capital (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 60.2 % &#160; &#160; 64.8 % &#160; &#160; 69.6 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Return on average segment capital is calculated by dividing (i) one-year period segment income ($1.5 billion for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014) by (ii) one-year average segment capital ($2.4 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively). ##TABLE_END CORPORATE &#38; OTHER \n\nCorporate functions and certain other businesses, including our Prepaid Services business and other operations, are included in Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nCorporate &#38; Other net expense was $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $827 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by the previously mentioned impairment charges in the prior year and higher income from our Prepaid Services business in the current year, all partially offset by restructuring charges in the current year and the benefit in the prior year from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities and other FX-related activity. The increase in 2015 was driven by the impairment charges, plus restructuring charges. These 2015 charges were partially offset by higher restructuring charges in 2014 and the benefit from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities in 2015. \n\nResults for all periods included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity requirements discussed in &#147;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity &#150; Liquidity Management,&#148; as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness. \n\n&#160;\n\nCONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY \n\nOur balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A solid and flexible equity capital profile; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. ##TABLE_END CAPITAL STRATEGY \n\nOur objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. \n\nThe level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. Our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. As a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. \n\nWe report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (see section on Transitional Basel III). The Basel III standards will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019 (see section on Fully Phased-in Basel III). \n\nWe also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under Basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions. The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk-based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches, and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk-based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements. \n\nThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank), as of December 31, 2016. \n\nTABLE 17: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nBasel III\n\nStandards 2016 (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; Ratios as of December 31, 2016 &#160; Risk-Based Capital \n\n&#160; &#160; Common Equity Tier 1\n\n&#160; &#160; 5.1 % &#160; American Express Company \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 12.3% &#160; American Express Centurion Bank \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 16.5 &#160; American Express Bank, FSB \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 16.3 &#160; Tier 1\n\n&#160; &#160; 6.6 &#160; &#160; American Express Company \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 13.5 &#160; American Express Centurion Bank \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 16.5 &#160; American Express Bank, FSB \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 16.3 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; &#160; 8.6 &#160; &#160; American Express Company \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 15.2 &#160; American Express Centurion Bank \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 17.8 &#160; American Express Bank, FSB \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 17.5 &#160; Tier 1 Leverage \n\n&#160; &#160; 4.0 &#160; &#160; American Express Company \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 11.6 &#160; American Express Centurion Bank \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 16.2 &#160; American Express Bank, FSB \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 13.9 &#160; Supplementary Leverage Ratio (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 3.0 % &#160; American Express Company \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 10.0 &#160; American Express Centurion Bank \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 12.6 &#160; American Express Bank, FSB \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 11.6% &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Transitional Basel III minimum capital requirement and additional capital conservation buffer as defined by the Federal Reserve for calendar year 2016 for advanced approaches institutions. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (b) The minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement of 3 percent is effective January 1, 2018. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nTABLE 18: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL COMPONENTS AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; American Express Company \n\n($ in Billions) \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; Risk-Based Capital \n\n&#160; Common Equity Tier 1\n\n&#160; $ 16.1 &#160; Tier 1 Capital\n\n&#160; &#160; 17.7 &#160; Tier 2 Capital (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.2 &#160; Total Capital\n\n&#160; &#160; 19.9 &#160; Risk-Weighted Assets \n\n&#160; &#160; 131.0 &#160; Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio \n\n&#160; &#160; 152.7 &#160; Total Leverage Exposure to calculate SLR \n\n&#160; $ 177.5 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank to take actions that could limit our business operations. \n\nOur primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. \n\nWe maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. We do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company. \n\nThe following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: \n\nRisk-Weighted Assets &#151; Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. \n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#151; Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders&#146; equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provisions. \n\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#151; Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. \n\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#151; Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for loan and receivable losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. \n\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio &#151; Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. \n\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio &#151; Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel III. Leverage exposure, which reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivatives exposures, securities purchased under agreements to resell and credit equivalents of undrawn commitments that are both conditionally and unconditionally cancellable. \n\n&#160;\n\nFULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III \n\nBasel III, when fully phased in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios had Basel III been fully phased in as of December 31, 2016. These ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward Basel III advanced approaches implementation in the United States. We believe the presentation of these ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital and leverage ratios. \n\nTABLE 19: ESTIMATED FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; ($ in Billions) &#160; &#160;\n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 11.8% &#160; Estimated Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 13.0 &#160; Estimated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 11.2 &#160; Estimated Supplementary Leverage Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III\n\n&#160; &#160; 9.7% &#160; Estimated Risk-Weighted Assets under Fully Phased-In Basel III (c) \n\n&#160; $ 131.9 &#160; Estimated Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 152.4 &#160; Estimated Total Leverage Exposure to calculate SLR under Fully Phased-In Basel III (d) \n\n&#160; $ 177.2 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) The Fully Phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios, non-GAAP measures, are calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 or Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules, as applicable, divided by risk-weighted assets under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules.

The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we returned $5.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends ($1.1 billion) and share repurchases ($4.4 billion). We repurchased 70 million common shares at an average price of $63.11 in 2016. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 99 percent of total capital generated during the year. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we had $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the &#147;Series B Preferred Shares&#148;) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the &#147;Series C Preferred Shares&#148;) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series B and Series C Preferred Shares during 2016 were $39 million and $41 million, respectively. For additional information on our preferred shares, refer to Note 17 &#147;Common and Preferred Shares&#148; and Note 22 &#147;Earnings per Common Share (EPS); Preferred Shares&#148; to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; \n\nFUNDING STRATEGY \n\nOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, maturity or investor. The mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries. \n\nOur proprietary card businesses are the primary asset-generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. We generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. We also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities. \n\nFUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES \n\nWe meet our funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party distributed deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long-term committed bank borrowing facility. \n\nWe had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of December 31: \n\nTABLE 21: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; (Billions) \n\n&#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; Short-term borrowings\n\n&#160; $ 5.6 &#160; &#160; $ 4.8 &#160; Long-term debt\n\n&#160; &#160; 47.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 48.1 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total debt\n\n&#160; &#160; 52.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 52.9 &#160; Customer deposits\n\n&#160; &#160; 53.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 55.0 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total debt and customer deposits\n\n&#160; $ 105.6 &#160; &#160; $ 107.9 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy Basel III&#146;s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time. \n\nOur funding plan for the full year 2017 includes, among other sources, approximately $7 billion to $15 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5 billion to $12 billion of secured term debt issuance. Our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell receivables, and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. \n\nOur equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody&#146;s Investor Services (Moody&#146;s), Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. \n\nTABLE 22: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCredit Agency \n\n&#160; American Express Entity \n\n&#160; Short-Term Ratings &#160; Long-Term Ratings &#160; Outlook DBRS\n\n&#160; All rated entities &#160; R-1 (middle) &#160; A (high) &#160; Stable Fitch\n\n&#160; All rated entities &#160; F1 &#160; A &#160; Negative Moody&#146;s\n\n&#160; TRS and rated operating subsidiaries (a) &#160; Prime-1 &#160; A2 &#160; Stable Moody&#146;s\n\n&#160; American Express Company &#160; Prime-2 &#160; A3 &#160; Stable S&#38;P\n\n&#160; TRS (a) &#160; N/A &#160; A- &#160; Stable S&#38;P\n\n&#160; Other rated operating subsidiaries &#160; A-2 &#160; A- &#160; Stable S&#38;P\n\n&#160; American Express Company &#160; A-2 &#160; BBB+ &#160; Stable &#160;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nDowngrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. \n\nSHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS \n\nShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of $0.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2016. Refer to Note 9 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for a further description of these borrowings. \n\nDEPOSIT PROGRAMS \n\nWe offer deposits within our Centurion Bank and American Express Bank subsidiaries. These funds are currently insured up to $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital levels of Centurion Bank and American Express Bank. We, through American Express Bank, have a direct retail deposit program, Personal Savings from American Express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third-party distribution channels. The direct retail program makes FDIC-insured certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings account products available directly to consumers. As of December 31, 2016 we had $53.0 billion in customer deposits. Refer to Note 8 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for a further description of these deposits. \n\nLONG-TERM DEBT PROGRAMS \n\nAs of December 31, 2016 we had $47.0 billion in long-term debt outstanding. During 2016, we and our subsidiaries issued $3.8 billion of unsecured debt with maturities ranging from 3 to 5 years. Refer to Note 9 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for a further description of these borrowings. \n\nOur 2016 debt issuances were as follows: \n\nTABLE 23: DEBT ISSUANCES \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; (Billions) \n\n&#160; 2016 &#160; American Express Credit Corporation:\n\n&#160; Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 1.65%)\n\n&#160; $ 3.5 &#160; Floating Rate Senior Notes (3-month LIBOR plus 57 basis points on average)\n\n&#160; &#160; 0.3 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 3.8 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS \n\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. \n\nThe loans and receivables being securitized are reported as Card Member loans and receivables on our &#147;Consolidated Balance Sheets,&#148; and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt. \n\nUnder the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, no such triggering events occurred. \n\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT \n\nWe incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services. Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months. Our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk. \n\nThe liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy thus \n\n&#160;\n\nincludes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the &#147;Funding Strategy&#148; section for more details); ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements; or ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework. ##TABLE_END We seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve&#146;s discount window. \n\nThe amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under Dodd-Frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity, such as the LCR, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. The LCR rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30-day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high-quality liquid assets. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. We were in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which we were subject, including the LCR, for the year ended December 31, 2016. \n\nThe investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. \n\nSecuritized Borrowing Capacity \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 16, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 17, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2016, $3.0 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility, which was subsequently reduced to $0.7 billion on January 17, 2017. No amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility. \n\nFederal Reserve Discount Window \n\nAs insured depository institutions, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. \n\nWe had approximately $57.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. \n\nCommitted Bank Credit Facility \n\nIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of December 31, 2016 of $3.0 billion, which expires on December 9, 2018. The availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants, principally the maintenance by American Express Credit Corporation (Credco) of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with each of our \n\n&#160;\n\ncovenants. As of December 31, 2016, no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility. The capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources. \n\nOur committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. \n\nCASH FLOWS \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows. \n\nTABLE 24: CASH FLOWS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n(Billions) \n\n&#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160;\n\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\nOperating activities\n\n&#160; $ 8.2 &#160; &#160; $ 10.6 &#160; &#160; $ 11.0 &#160; &#160;\n\nInvesting activities\n\n&#160; &#160; 1.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; (8.2) &#160; &#160; &#160; (8.0) &#160; &#160;\n\nFinancing activities\n\n&#160; &#160; (7.5) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1.7) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160;\n\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and other\n\n&#160; &#160; (0.2) &#160; &#160; &#160; (0.2) &#160; &#160; &#160; (0.2) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; $ 2.4 &#160; &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; &#160; $ 2.8 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Cash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. \n\nFor December 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.2 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, driven by net income of $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, adjusted for non-cash items including changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation. The current period net income includes gains of $1.2 billion on the sales of the HFS portfolios, which is presented in Net decrease (increase) in Card Member receivables and loans, including held for sale, within Cash flows from investing activities. The decrease during the periods of comparison was also driven primarily by impacts from movements in Other assets as a result of normal business operating activities. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, including Card Member loans and receivables HFS, along with gains on sales related thereto, as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $1.9 billion and ($8.2) billion, respectively. The increase in the current period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily driven by the sales of the HFS portfolios, partially offset by increases in Card Member receivables and loans held for investment. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, changes in customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $7.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The increase in the current period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily resulted from a net decrease in customer deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by lower net repayments of long-term debt in the current year, as compared to the prior year. \n\n&#160;\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS \n\nWe have identified both on- and off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS \n\nThe table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations. Purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n\nTABLE 25: COMMITTED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\nPayments due by year (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; (Millions) \n\n&#160; 2017 &#160; &#160; 2018-2019 &#160; &#160; 2020-2021 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n2022 and\n\nthereafter\n\n&#160; &#160; Total &#160; Long-term debt\n\n&#160; $ 15,724 &#160; &#160; $ 22,042 &#160; &#160; $ 6,957 &#160; &#160; $ 3,158 &#160; &#160; $ 47,881 &#160; Interest payments on long-term debt (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 913 &#160; &#160; &#160; 797 &#160; &#160; &#160; 324 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,267 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,301 &#160; Certificates of deposit\n\n&#160; &#160; 3,750 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,833 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,648 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,231 &#160; Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) \n\n&#160; &#160; 224 &#160; &#160; &#160; 103 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; 365 &#160; Operating lease obligations\n\n&#160; &#160; 127 &#160; &#160; &#160; 199 &#160; &#160; &#160; 118 &#160; &#160; &#160; 788 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,232 &#160; Purchase obligations (e) \n\n&#160; &#160; 456 &#160; &#160; &#160; 269 &#160; &#160; &#160; 126 &#160; &#160; &#160; 63 &#160; &#160; &#160; 914 &#160; Cobrand obligations (f) \n\n&#160; &#160; 72 &#160; &#160; &#160; 104 &#160; &#160; &#160; 202 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; 388 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 21,266 &#160; &#160; $ 29,347 &#160; &#160; $ 10,398 &#160; &#160; $ 5,301 &#160; &#160; $ 66,312 &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) The table above excludes approximately $1.0 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments, if any, to be made over a range of years. Refer to Note 21 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (b) Estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of December 31, 2016, and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps. Actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (c) As of December 31, 2016, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned, for the U.S. American Express Retirement Plan. For the U.S. American Express Retirement Restoration Plan and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, contributions in 2017 are anticipated to be approximately $34 million, and this amount has been included within other long-term liabilities. Remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating $666 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Additionally, other long-term liabilities do not include $7.1 billion of Membership Rewards liabilities, which are not considered long-term liabilities as Card Members in good standing can redeem points immediately, without restrictions, and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (d) As of December 31, 2016, we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a $266 million unfunded commitment included in other long-term liabilities. In addition to this amount, there was a further $151 million of contractual off-balance sheet obligations which have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable. Refer to Note 6 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (e) The purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations, as applicable, by period under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2016. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (f) Represents obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. Such cobrand agreements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to eight years. We expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of our business. ##TABLE_END In addition to the contractual obligations noted in Table 25, we have off-balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain other off-balance sheet arrangements. \n\nGUARANTEES \n\nOur principal guarantees are associated with Card Member services to enhance the value of owning an American Express card. As of December 31, 2016, we had guarantees totaling approximately $48 billion related to Card Member protection plans, as well as other guarantees and indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Note 16 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further discussion regarding our guarantees. \n\nCERTAIN OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $242 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. \n\nTo mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives, we accepted non-cash collateral in the form of security interests in U.S. Treasury securities from our derivatives counterparties with a fair value of $18 million and nil as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, none of which was sold or repledged. \n\nRefer to Notes 7 and 13 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for discussion regarding our other off-balance sheet arrangements. \n\n&#160;\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT \n\nGOVERNANCE \n\nWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. \n\nRisk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance &#38; Ethics Officer, the General Auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the &#147;tone at the top,&#148; our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. \n\nThe Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our enterprise-wide risk management framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite for risks, including individual credit risk, institutional credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk, compliance risk, model risk, asset/liability risk and strategic and business risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits, escalation triggers and assessing control programs. \n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks, transactions and exposures. \n\nThe Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations. \n\nThe Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Basel capital and liquidity standards, our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submissions, and resolution planning. \n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls. \n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs in the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our General Auditor and approves Internal Audit&#146;s annual audit plan, charter, policies and budget. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan&#146;s status and results including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. \n\nThe Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our business units and risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting goals, including for our business units. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the current and forward-looking risk profiles of each business unit, and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives. \n\nThere are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, economic capital and Basel capital trends, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. \n\nAs defined in the ERM policy, we follow the &#147;three lines of defense&#148; approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Business unit presidents, our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Market Risk Officer and Functional Risk Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions \n\n&#160;\n\noverseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance &#38; Ethics Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer, the Corporate Controller and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. \n\nOur Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense, and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense. \n\nIn addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing market, liquidity, asset/liability risk and capital. \n\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nCredit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. \n\nINDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK \n\nIndividual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, lines of credit, and loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. Externally, the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which can affect customer liquidity. \n\nThe business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee, which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. This policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension, including prospecting, new account approvals, point-of-sale authorizations, credit line management and collections. The subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition. \n\nIndividual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use the most up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. Additional data, such as commercial variables, are integrated to further mitigate small business risk. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers. \n\nINSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK \n\nInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our Global Commercial Services, Global Merchant Services, GNS, Prepaid Services and Foreign Exchange Services businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios. \n\nSimilar to Individual Credit Risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors. \n\nExposure to the Airline Industry \n\nWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; \n\n&#160;\n\nDebt Exposure \n\nAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2016, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems, or the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. \n\nTo appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups. \n\nWe use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre-implementation test metrics, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments. \n\nThe framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective. \n\nINFORMATION SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND DATA GOVERNANCE \n\nWe have implemented an Information Security Program and Operating Model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. \n\nOur Information Security Program and Operating Model are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and cover different phases of security to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information security incidents. \n\nChaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, our Information Security Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management program. In addition, the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness. The Information Security Oversight team provides challenges and independent assessment of the information security program. \n\nOur Privacy Framework and Operating Model follow a similar structure. Chaired by the Global Head of Privacy and Information Security Oversight and attended by the Chief Privacy Officer, our Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. The committee is responsible for the governance over the collection, notice, use, sharing, transfer, confidentiality and retention of personal data. \n\nOur Enterprise Data Governance Framework and Policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting, risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities. \n\nSee &#147;A significant operating disruption, a major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards&#148; under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; for additional information. \n\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards of conduct. \n\nWe view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management \n\n&#160;\n\nProgram. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed. \n\nWe have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. As part of that program, the Global Risk Oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance. \n\nREPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products, services, business practices, management, clients and partners, whether perceived or real, could cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. \n\nWe view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the world&#146;s most respected service brand and fundamental to our long-term success. \n\nOur business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions, business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC and its sub-committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected. \n\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and our interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_END Our Asset-Liability Management (ALM) and Market Risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. \n\nMarket risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and ALM activities, as well as overseeing compliance with the Volcker Rule and other regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments. \n\nWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable-and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to (or from) variable-rate, from (or to) fixed-rate. We generally do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our Foreign Exchange International Payments business activities. Refer to Note 14 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately $193 million. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. It is further assumed that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon reprice by 100 basis points. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors. For example, the interest rate we pay on deposit balances within our high-yield savings accounts may not change at the same time or to the same degree as market interest rates. \n\nIn addition to parallel rate changes, our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates. For example, movements in Prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans, while LIBOR rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding. Differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices, commonly referred to as basis risk, would thus impact our net interest income. The detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between Prime and one-month LIBOR over the next twelve months is estimated to be $35 million. We currently have approximately $36 billion of Prime-based, variable-rate U.S. lending receivables and loans and $35 billion of LIBOR-indexed debt, including asset securitizations. \n\n&#160;\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: 1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, 2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, 3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and 4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. \n\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $28 billion and $26 billion were outstanding, respectively. \n\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of December 31, 2016. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2016. With respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately $185 million as of December 31, 2016. \n\nTo a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure. \n\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses. \n\nFUNDING &#38; LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nLiquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost. \n\nOur Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management. \n\nLiquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. In addition, the Market Risk Oversight Officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. \n\nLiquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. \n\nMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to our reputation, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. \n\nWe manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework, including policies and procedures for model development, independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs and misuse. We also assess model performance on an ongoing basis. \n\nSTRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nStrategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services. \n\nStrategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Deal Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees. \n\n&#160;\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nRefer to Note 1 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows: \n\nRESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER LOSSES \n\nReserves for Card Member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, as of the balance sheet date. \n\nIn estimating these losses, we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve. The models take into account several factors, including delinquency-based loss migration rates, loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period, as well as expected future recoveries. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on Card Member loans and receivables. \n\nThe process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent historical credit experience, updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends, is not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for Card Member losses in any quarter. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables, evaluated collectively for impairment, would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately $169 million. This sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses. It does not represent our expectations for losses in the future, nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency-based loss migration rates or recoveries, or the amount of outstanding balances, may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses. \n\nLIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE \n\nThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, entertainment, retail certificates and merchandise. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. \n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the WAC per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 10 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information. \n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations. \n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. \n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. \n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2016, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $92 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $89 million. \n\n&#160;\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT \n\nOur investment securities and derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which require management to make assumptions and apply judgments when assessing fair value. \n\nThe objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability by utilizing the three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, we will measure fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs (Level 2). We do not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). For additional information on our fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 15 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; \n\nInvestment Securities \n\nOur investment securities are mostly composed of fixed-income securities issued by states and municipalities in the United States, the U.S. Government and its Agencies and select foreign governments. The fair value of our investment securities, including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets, are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. We did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services used as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. For additional information on our investment securities, refer to Note 5 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nOur primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements. The fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third-party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models, or by internal pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Note 14 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; \n\nIn the measurement of fair value for our investment securities and derivative instruments, although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are based on observable markets inputs, the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity, and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs, or how they are modeled, could result in a different estimate of fair value. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our third-party valuation services at least annually. \n\nGOODWILL RECOVERABILITY \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant judgment. \n\nFor valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. \n\nWhen preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit&#146;s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies&#146; multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units&#146; actual results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. \n\nRefer to Note 2 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information regarding the Prepaid Services goodwill impairment in 2015. \n\nWe could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management&#146;s current assumptions. \n\n&#160;\n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer&#146;s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws. \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. \n\nIn establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. \n\nTax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. \n\nDeferred Tax Asset Realization \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. \n\nSince deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. \n\nChanges in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties. \n\n&#160;\n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nRefer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; \n\nGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY \n\nAdjusted net interest income &#151; A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans and loans HFS (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans. \n\nAsset securitizations &#151; Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our &#147;Consolidated Balance Sheets.&#148; \n\nAverage discount rate &#151; This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general-purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party. \n\nBasic cards-in-force &#151; Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. Non-proprietary basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. \n\nBilled business &#151; Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located. \n\nCapital ratios &#151; Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under &#147;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#148; for further related definitions under Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-in Basel III. \n\nCard Member &#151; The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit and certain prepaid cards. \n\nCard Member loans &#151; Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products. \n\nCard Member loans and receivables HFS &#151; Beginning as of December 1, 2015 and continuing until the sales were completed, represents Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco in the United States and JetBlue. The JetBlue and Costco portfolio sales were completed on March 18 and June 17, 2016, respectively. \n\nCard Member receivables &#151; Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees. \n\nCharge cards &#151; Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member&#146;s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have additional Pay Over Time feature(s) that allow revolving of certain balances. \n\nCobrand cards &#151; Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. In some cases, the partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner&#146;s own loyalty program. \n\nCredit cards &#151; Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures. \n\n&#160;\n\nDiscount revenue &#151; Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants, payments to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs and statement credits, corporate incentive payments and other similar items. \n\nInterest expense &#151; Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. \n\nInterest income &#151; Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. \n\nInterest on loans &#151; Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans and loans HFS. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. \n\nInterest and dividends on investment securities &#151; Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. \n\nInterest income on deposits with banks and other &#151; Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. \n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio &#151; Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress. \n\nMerchant acquisition &#151; Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded cards. \n\nNet card fees &#151; Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. \n\nNet interest yield on Card Member loans &#151; A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. We believe net interest yield on Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. \n\nNet loss ratio &#151; Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members. \n\nNet write-off rate &#151; principal only &#151; Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivables balance during the period. \n\nNet write-off rate &#151; principal, interest and fees &#151; Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. \n\nOperating expenses &#151; Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. \n\nReturn on average equity &#151; Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders&#146; equity. \n\nReturn on average segment capital &#151; Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital. \n\nSegment capital &#151; Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory capital requirements. \n\nTotal cards-in-force &#151; Represents the total number of charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding and accepted on our network. Non-proprietary cards-in-force includes all charge and credit cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period. \n\n&#160;\n\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives, including growing profitable spending from new and existing Card Members, increasing penetration among middle market and small business clients, expanding our international footprint and increasing merchant acceptance; the level of spend in bonus categories on rewards-based and/or cash-back cards and redemptions of Card Member rewards and offers; the impact of any future restructuring charges or other contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, impairments, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in Card Member reimbursements and changes in reserves; write-downs of deferred tax assets as a result of tax law or other changes; credit performance remaining consistent with current expectations; continued growth of Card Member loans; the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and operating leverage at levels consistent with current expectations; the amount we spend on growth initiatives and our ability to drive growth from such investments; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations (including the impact of hedge ineffectiveness); the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members; our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, our geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected, changes in tax laws and regulation and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards, competition for cobrand relationships and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the actual amount to be spent on marketing and promotion, as well as the timing of any such spending, which will be based in part on management&#146;s assessment of competitive opportunities; overall business performance; contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments; management&#146;s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities; and our ability to realize efficiencies, optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; rewards expense and cost of Card Member services growing faster or slower than expectations, which will depend in part on Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns and actual usage and redemption of rewards, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value proposition we offer; increasing competition, which could result in greater rewards offerings; our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; and the amount we spend on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to reduce our overall cost base, which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of reengineering plans, which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions, our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings and underestimating hiring and other employee needs; our ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified below; and our ability to optimize and lower marketing and promotion expenses, which could be impacted by higher advertising and Card Member acquisition costs, competitive pressures that may require additional expenditures or limit our ability to reduce costs, an inability to shift acquisition to digital channels, the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic conditions; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, or fraud costs; our ability to develop, implement and achieve substantial benefits from reengineering plans; higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements;

greater than expected inflation or merit increases; our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and the level of M&#38;A activity and related expenses; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our lending delinquency and write-off rates and growth of provision expense being higher than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances, delinquency rates, mix of loan balances, loans related to new Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to execute against our lending strategy to grow loans, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk in a growing Card Member loan portfolio, and the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing Card Members&#146; spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the possibility that we will not fully execute on our plans for OptBlue to significantly increase merchant coverage, which will depend in part on the success of OptBlue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept American Express, which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers, the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of OptBlue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for American Express acceptance, as well as the awareness and willingness of Card Members to use American Express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept American Express cards; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators, the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies and our results of operations and capital needs in any given period;

##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; changes in capital and credit market conditions, including sovereign creditworthiness, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets; or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding, restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; legal and regulatory developments, including with regard to actions by the CFPB and other regulators, broad payment system regulatory regimes and the stricter regulation of financial institutions, which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices; result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, litigation-related settlements, judgments or expenses, restitution to Card Members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties; materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; result in harm to the American Express brand; potential actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact our asset securitization program; or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions, products and services; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in GNS or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, terrorism, cyberattacks or fraud, which could significantly affect demand for and spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions. ##TABLE_END A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in &#147;Risk Factors&#148;
