MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") is intended to help the reader understand The Coca-Cola Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to &#8212; and should be read in conjunction with &#8212; our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&#38;A, which includes the following sections: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOur Business &#8212; a general description of our business and the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry; our objective; our strategic priorities; our core capabilities; and challenges and risks of our business. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#8212; a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperations Review &#8212; an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. Except to the extent that differences among our operating segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion on a consolidated basis. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; an analysis of cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations; foreign exchange; the impact of inflation and changing prices; and an overview of financial position. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur Business \n\nGeneral \n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than 500 &#32;nonalcoholic beverage brands including sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages such as waters, flavored waters and enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, sports drinks, dairy, and energy drinks. We own and market four &#32;of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 &#32;countries. \n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers &#8212; the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for more than 1.9 billion &#32;of the approximately 59 billion &#32;servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day. \n\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. \n\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets &#8212; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#8212; to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. \n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nbeverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate business\" or \"concentrate operations\"); and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfinished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product business\" or \"finished product operations\"). \n\n##TABLE_END Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. \n\nIn our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers &#8212; such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles &#8212; bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\nOur finished product operations consist primarily of Company-owned or -controlled bottling, sales and distribution operations, including CCR's bottling and associated supply chain operations in the United States and Canada, and are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. We authorize these wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n2015 \n\nConcentrate operations 1 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nFinished product operations 2 \n\n63 \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n2015 \n\nConcentrate operations 1 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nFinished product operations 2 \n\n27 \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nIncludes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. \n\n##TABLE_END The Nonalcoholic Beverage Segment of the Commercial Beverage Industry \n\nWe operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. \n\nOur Objective \n\nOur objective is to use our formidable assets &#8212; our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates &#8212; to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPeople: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPortfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people's desires and needs. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPartners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPlanet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProfit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProductivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. \n\n##TABLE_END Strategic Priorities \n\nWe have five strategic priorities designed to help us achieve our objective. These strategic priorities are accelerating growth of a consumer-centric brand portfolio; driving revenue growth, led by sparkling beverages; strengthening the Coca-Cola system; digitizing the enterprise; and unlocking the power of our people. In order to execute on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing, commercial leadership and franchise leadership. \n\nCore Capabilities \n\nConsumer Marketing \n\nMarketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of, and increase consumer preference for, our brands. Successful marketing investments produce long-term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions. \n\nWe are focusing on marketing strategies to drive volume growth in emerging markets, increase our brand value in developing markets and grow net revenues and profit in our developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs but generally at a slower rate than gross profit growth. \n\nCommercial Leadership \n\nThe Coca-Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customer's business and needs &#8212; whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive consumer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. \n\nFranchise Leadership \n\nWe must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Company's success. We work with our bottling partners to identify processes that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca-Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. \n\nChallenges and Risks \n\nBeing global provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our Company. Of these, six key challenges and risks are discussed below. \n\nObesity \n\nThe rates of obesity affecting communities, cultures and countries worldwide continue to be too high. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand and recognize that obesity is a complex public health challenge and are committed to being a part of the solution. \n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Commercially, we continue to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\noffer reduced-, low- or no-calorie beverage options; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprovide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of all of our packages; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprovide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nmarket responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 12. \n\n##TABLE_END The heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find winning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a more helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action. \n\nWater Quality and Quantity \n\nWater quality and quantity is an issue that requires our Company's sustained attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increased food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. \n\nOur Company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program. Mitigation of water risk forms the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework. This strategy is executed at the local level where we operate and includes the following elements: water use efficiency and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water resource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain. Such efforts are conducted in collaboration and partnership with others and are intended to help address local needs. Many of these efforts help us in achieving our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. We are also collaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world. \n\nThrough these integrated programs, we believe that our Company can leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve &#8212; through source water availability assessments and planning, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect continued action on our part to help with the successful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource, both for our business and the communities we serve. \n\nEvolving Consumer Preferences \n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, consumers want more choices. We are committed to meeting their needs and to generating new growth through our portfolio of more than 500 brands and nearly 3,900 beverage products, including nearly 1,200 low- and no-calorie products, new product offerings, innovative packaging and ingredient education efforts. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their ever-changing needs, desires and lifestyles. \n\nIncreased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace \n\nOur Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we strategically expand into other profitable categories of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. \n\nProduct Safety and Quality \n\nAs the world's largest beverage company, we strive to meet the highest of standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with the world. We have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences. Across the Coca-Cola system, we take great care in an effort to ensure that every one of our beverages meets the highest standards for safety and quality. \n\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions and engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management system also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace. \n\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries where our products are sold. We consistently reassess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain. \n\nFood Security \n\nIncreased demand for commodities and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. We are dedicated to implementing our sustainable sourcing commitment, which is founded on principles that protect the environment, uphold workplace rights and help build more sustainable communities. To support this commitment, our programs focus on economic opportunity, with an emphasis on female farmers, and environmental sustainability designed to help address these agricultural challenges. Through joint efforts with farmers, communities, bottlers, suppliers and key partners, as well as our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, we can together help make a positive strategic impact on food security. \n\nAll of these challenges and risks &#8212; obesity; water quality and quantity; evolving consumer preferences; increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace; product safety and quality; and food security &#8212; have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. \n\nSee also ''Item 1A. Risk Factors'' in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRecoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n##TABLE_END Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a \"VIE.\" An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 3,709 million &#32;and $ 2,687 million &#32;as of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively, \n\nrepresenting our maximum exposures to loss. The Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company's investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $ 203 million &#32;and $ 221 million &#32;as of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. \n\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. \n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. \n\nRecoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets \n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading \"Our Business &#8212; Challenges and Risks\" above and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. \n\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. \n\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and/or impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. \n\nManagement's assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, pricing, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of current and noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. Certain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. \n\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities \n\nThe carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are carried at fair value if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"), except for the change in fair value attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which is included in net income. Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. \n\nThe following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2016 \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage \n\nof Total \n\nAssets 1 \n\nEquity method investments \n\n$ \n\n16,260 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSecurities classified as available-for-sale \n\n6,413 \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurities classified as trading \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nCost method investments \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n23,197 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nAccounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nThe total percentage does not add due to rounding. \n\n##TABLE_END Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. \n\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's cost basis in investments in publicly traded companies accounted for under the equity method (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2016 \n\nFair \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nDifference \n\nMonster Beverage Corporation \n\n$ \n\n4,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,240 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,288 \n\nCoca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. \n\n3,725 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,370 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,355 \n\nCoca-Cola European Partners plc 1 \n\n2,762 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n(462 \n\n) \n\nCoca-Cola HBC AG \n\n1,867 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,140 \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola Amatil Limited \n\n1,681 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola East Japan Co., Ltd. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola &#304;&#231;ecek A.&#350;. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmbotelladora Andina S.A. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co.

Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge. \n\nOther Assets \n\nOur Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers for distribution rights as well as to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nAs of December 31, 2016 , the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was $ 10,635 million , or 12 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment review is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. \n\nThe following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2016 \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage \n\nof Total \n\nAssets \n\nGoodwill \n\n$ \n\n10,629 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTrademarks with indefinite lives \n\n6,097 \n\n&#160; \n\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives \n\n3,676 \n\n&#160; \n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, net \n\n&#160; \n\nOther intangible assets not subject to amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n21,128 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; \n\nAccounts for less than 1 percent of the Company's total assets. \n\n##TABLE_END When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. \n\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment. \n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as \"business units.\" These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, including CCR's bottling and associated supply chain operations in the United States and Canada. Generally, each Company-owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. \n\nThe goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nThe Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the two-step process to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the two-step process. Otherwise, the Company will forego the two-step process and does not need to perform any further testing. As of December 31, 2016 , we did not have any reporting unit with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that it will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. \n\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. \n\nDuring 2016, the Company recorded charges of $153 million related to certain intangible assets. These charges included $143 million related to the impairment of certain U.S. bottlers' franchise rights, primarily as a result of lower operating performance compared to previously modeled results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately received upon refranchising the territory. The remaining charge of $10 million was related to the impairment of goodwill and resulted from management's revised outlook on market conditions. These impairment charges were recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to their respective carrying values. \n\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $55 million related to the impairment of a Venezuelan trademark. The Venezuelan trademark impairment was due to the Company's revised expectations regarding the convertibility of the local currency. In 2015, the Company also closed a transaction with Monster. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company was required to discontinue selling energy products under one of the trademarks included in the glac&#233;au portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized impairment charges of $418 million, primarily as a result of discontinuing these products. The charges for the impairment of these trademarks were recorded in our Corporate operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the trademarks, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to the respective carrying values. \n\nThe Company did not record any significant impairment charges related to intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014. \n\nThe total combined fair value of the various trademarks in the glac&#233;au portfolio significantly exceeds the remaining combined carrying value of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. However, the fair value of the individual trademark that was the subject of the impairment charges discussed above only slightly exceeds its carrying value. If the future operating results of this trademark do not support the current near-term financial projections, or if macroeconomic conditions change causing the cost of capital and/or discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge related to this trademark. \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\nOur Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi-employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. \n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and obligations. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and obligations. \n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , the weighted-average discount rate used to compute our pension obligations was 4.00 percent &#32;and 4.25 percent , respectively. \n\nEffective January 1, 2016, the Company changed its method of measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. The Company believes the approach adopted in 2016 provides a more precise measurement of these components by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, for plans using the yield curve approach, the Company measured the service cost and interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve. \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long-term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate our pension expense was 8.25 percent &#32;in 2016 and 2015. \n\nIn 2016 , the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $238 million , which primarily included $86 million of net periodic benefit cost and $155 million of settlement charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2017, we expect our total pension expense to be $366 million, which includes $41 million of net periodic benefit cost and $325 million of estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2017 expected net periodic benefit cost is due to favorable asset performance in 2016 compared to our expected return, partially offset by a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the U.S. plans and a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate on our 2017 net periodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $30 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on our 2017 net periodic benefit cost would be an increase to our pension expense of $29 million. \n\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company's primary U.S. plan represented 58 percent &#32;and 61 percent &#32;of the Company's consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets, respectively. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. \n\nOur customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were $ 6.6 billion , $ 6.8 billion &#32;and $ 7.0 billion &#32;in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Income Taxes\" below and Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Notice from the IRS for the tax years 2007 through 2009, after a five-year audit. In the Notice, the IRS claims that the Company's United States taxable income should be increased by an amount that creates a potential additional federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion &#32;for the period, plus interest. No penalties were asserted in the Notice. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets. The IRS designated the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To that end, the Company filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court on December 14, 2015, and the IRS filed its answer on February 12, 2016. A trial date has been set for March 5, 2018. The Company believes that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, the additional tax, interest and any potential penalties could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. \n\nTax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. \n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company's valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $ 530 million &#32;and were primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a \n\nreduction of income tax expense. The Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet. \n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. As of December 31, 2016 , undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $ 35.5 billion . Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate is expected to be 24.0 percent in 2017. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2017. \n\nOperations Review \n\nOur organizational structure as of December 31, 2016 &#32;consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments refer to Note 19 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands \n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance. \n\nUnit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading \"Beverage Volume\" below. \n\nOur Bottling Investments operating segment and our other finished product operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks and sports drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these consolidated finished product operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations, and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as appropriate), (2) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes as structural changes, which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures (\"structural changes\"). Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures. \n\n\"Acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. \n\n\"Licensed brands\" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that the licenses are entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider newly licensed brands to be structural changes. \n\nDuring 2016, the Company deconsolidated its South African bottling operations and disposed of its related equity method investment in exchange for equity method investments in CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary. As part of the transaction, the Company also acquired and licensed several brands. The impacts of the deconsolidation, the disposal of the related equity method investment and the new equity method investments have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments and equity income on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. The brands and licenses that the Company acquired impacted the Company&#8217;s unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also considered acquired brands. Refer to the headings \"Beverage Volume\" and \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nAlso in 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations as a result of their being combined to create CCEP. As a result of the transaction, the Company now owns an equity method investment in CCEP. Accordingly, the impact of the deconsolidation and new equity method investment has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Bottling Investments operating segments and equity income on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. During 2016, the Company also changed our funding arrangement with our bottling partners in China, which resulted in a reduction in net operating revenues with an offsetting reduction in direct marketing expense. The impact of the change in the arrangement has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Asia Pacific operating segment. Refer to the headings \"Beverage Volume\" and \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nThroughout 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company refranchised bottling territories in North America that were previously managed by CCR to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners. The impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. In addition, for non-Company-owned and licensed beverage products sold in the refranchised territories for which the Company no longer reports unit case volume, we have eliminated the unit case volume from the applicable base year when calculating volume growth rates on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the headings \"Beverage Volume\" and \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nIn 2015, the Company closed a transaction with Monster (\"Monster Transaction\"), which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for each of the Company's operating segments. This transaction consisted of multiple elements including, but not limited to, the acquisition of Monster&#8217;s non-energy brands and the expansion of our distribution territories for Monster's energy brands. These elements of the transaction impacted the Company&#8217;s unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and therefore, in addition to being included as a structural change, they are also considered acquired brands. \n\nAlso during 2015, the Company acquired a South African bottler, which has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nIn 2014, the Company made a decision to change our process of buying and selling recyclable materials in North America. Also during 2014, the Company transitioned our Russian juice operations to an existing joint venture with an unconsolidated bottling partner and acquired a majority interest in bottling operations in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The impact of these changes is included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for our Bottling Investments operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Net Operating Revenues\" below. \n\nThe Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. \n\nThe Company is currently pursuing certain transactions that, if completed, will be included as structural changes for the applicable periods. We intend to refranchise 100 percent of Company-owned bottling operations in the United States by the end of 2017. The Company has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Company-owned bottling operations in China to the two existing franchise bottlers and to sell a related cost method investment to one of the franchise bottlers. The sale of the China bottling operations and cost method investment are subject to various regulatory approvals and expected to close in the first half of 2017. Additionally, the Company has reached an agreement with ABI to transition its interest in CCBA and agreed in principle to acquire ABI's interest in bottling operations in certain other countries. These transactions are subject to the relevant regulatory and minority shareholder approvals and are expected to close by the end of 2017. \n\nBeverage Volume \n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, \"unit case\" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. \n\nInformation about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPercent Change &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n2015 vs. 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\nUnit Cases 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\nConcentrate \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nUnit Cases 1,2 \n\n&#160; \n\nConcentrate \n\nSales \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n3 &#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n4 &#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n3 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4 &#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottling Investments \n\n(16 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nBottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nGeographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 &#160; \n\nAfter considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume both worldwide and for North America for the year ended December 31, 2016 grew 1 percent. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4 &#160; \n\nAfter considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume both worldwide and for North America for the year ended December 31, 2015 grew 1 percent. \n\n##TABLE_END Unit Case Volume \n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 29.3 billion , 29.2 billion &#32;and 28.6 billion &#32;unit cases of our products in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The unit case volume for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflects the impact of brands acquired and licensed during the applicable year. The unit case volume for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflects the impact of the transfer of distribution rights with respect to non-Company-owned brands that were previously licensed to us in North American bottling territories that have since been refranchised. The unit case volume in 2015 and 2014 reflects the discontinuance of certain brands owned by our Russian juice company in connection with the transition in 2014 of our Russian juice operations to an existing joint venture with an unconsolidated bottling partner (for information about these structural changes, refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\" above). The Company eliminated the unit case volume related to these structural changes from the base year, as applicable, when calculating 2016 versus 2015 and 2015 versus 2014 unit case volume growth rates. \n\nSparkling beverages represented 72 percent, 73 percent and 73 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 45 percent, 46 percent and 46 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. \n\nIn 2016 , unit case volume in the United States represented 19 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 66 percent was attributable to sparkling beverages and 34 percent to still beverages. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. \n\nUnit case volume outside the United States represented 81 percent &#32;of the Company's worldwide unit case volume for 2016 . The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and Japan, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 73 percent was attributable to sparkling beverages and 27 percent to still beverages. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2016 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32; \n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, unit case volume grew 1 percent, reflecting a 3 percent increase in still beverages and even volume in sparkling beverages. The group's sparkling beverage performance included a 1 percent decline in Trademark Coca-Cola, offset by an increase of 4 percent in Trademark Sprite and an increase of 1 percent in Trademark Fanta. The increase in still beverage volume reflected growth in packaged water, teas and sports drinks, partially offset by a decline in juices and juice drinks. The group reported increases in unit case volume in our Western Europe, Middle East &#38; North Africa, West Africa and South &#38; East Africa business units. The increases in these business units were partially offset by declines in unit case volume in both our Central &#38; Eastern Europe and Turkey, Caucasus &#38; Central Asia business units. \n\nUnit case volume in Latin America decreased 1 percent, reflecting a decline of 2 percent in sparkling beverage volume partially offset by still beverage volume growth of 2 percent. The growth in the group's still beverages was led by our performance in packaged water, teas and sports drinks. The group's volume reflected a decline of 7 percent in both the Brazil and Latin Center business units and a decline of 3 percent in the South Latin business unit. These declines were partially offset by unit case volume growth of 5 percent in the Mexico business unit, which reflected 6 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 4 percent growth in still beverages. Mexico's sparkling beverage unit case growth was led by 4 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola. \n\nIn North America, unit case volume grew 1 percent, reflecting even sparkling beverage volume and still beverage volume growth of 3 percent. North America's volume performance in sparkling beverages included 3 percent growth in Trademark Sprite, 6 percent growth in Trademark Fanta and strong growth in energy drinks offset by a 5 percent decline in Diet Coke. The increase in still beverage volume reflected growth in packaged water, sports drinks, juices and juice drinks and dairy. In addition, still beverage volume performance included 6 percent growth in vitaminwater. \n\nUnit case volume in Asia Pacific increased 2 percent. Sparkling beverage volume was even, which included 2 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola offset by a 4 percent decline in Trademark Sprite. The group's still beverage volume increased 5 percent, reflecting growth in packaged water, teas and coffee, partially offset by a decline in juices and juice drinks. The group's unit case volume reflected an increase of 6 percent in the ASEAN business unit and an increase of 3 percent in both the India &#38; South West Asia and Japan business units. The growth in these business units was partially offset by a unit case volume decline of 1 percent in the Greater China &#38; Korea business unit. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 16 percent. This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China. The decline in CCR's unit case volume is primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The unfavorable impact of these items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 33 percent and 67 percent of the unit case volume in China and India, respectively. CCR accounted for 51 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case volume in North America. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32; \n\nIn Europe, Middle East and Africa, unit case volume grew 3 percent, which consisted of 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 6 percent growth in still beverages. The group's sparkling beverage growth included 2 percent growth in both Trademark Coca-Cola and Trademark Fanta. The growth in still beverages was led by packaged water, juices and juice drinks, teas and the expansion of the innocent brand. Europe, Middle East and Africa benefited from unit case volume growth of 6 percent in the South &#38; East Africa business unit and growth of 2 percent in both the Middle East &#38; North Africa and Central &#38; Eastern Europe business units. \n\nUnit case volume in Latin America grew 1 percent as a result of growth in still beverages of 4 percent and even sparkling beverage volume. The growth in still beverages was led by growth in packaged water, juices and juice drinks, and sports drinks. The Latin Center and South Latin business units reported unit case volume growth of 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. The Mexico business unit reported unit case volume growth of 3 percent, reflecting growth in Trademark Coca-Cola of 3 percent. The growth in the Latin Center, South Latin and Mexico business units was partially offset by a unit case volume decline of 4 percent in the Brazil business unit. \n\nIn North America, unit case volume grew 1 percent. This increase reflects 5 percent growth in still beverage volume and even sparkling beverage volume. The still beverage growth in the group was led by 8 percent growth in packaged water and 6 percent growth in teas. After considering the impact of the acquired volume resulting from the Monster Transaction, North America unit case volume growth remained 1 percent. \n\nUnit case volume in Asia Pacific increased 4 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in both sparkling and still beverage volume. The sparkling beverage volume growth was led by a 5 percent increase in Trademark Coca-Cola, a 4 percent increase in Trademark Sprite and a 6 percent increase in Trademark Fanta. Still beverage volume growth was led by increases in packaged water and teas of 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. China's unit case volume grew 5 percent during the year, led by 12 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 3 percent growth in Trademark Sprite. India reported unit case volume growth of 4 percent and Japan reported even volume. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments was even, reflecting growth in China, India and Germany offset by a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 8 percent. The decline in CCR's unit case volume is primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 34 percent, 69 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and Germany, respectively. CCR accounted for 73 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case volume in North America. \n\nConcentrate Sales Volume \n\nIn 2016 , worldwide unit case volume grew 1 percent and concentrate sales volume was even compared to 2015 . In 2015 , worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 2 percent compared to 2014 . After considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume grew 1 percent during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. \n\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa &#8212; favorable product and geographic mix; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLatin America &#8212; favorable price mix in all four of the segment's business units and the impact of inflationary environments in certain markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNorth America &#8212; favorably impacted as a result of pricing initiatives and product and package mix; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAsia Pacific &#8212; unfavorable product and channel mix. \n\n##TABLE_END The unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 3 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the South African rand, euro, U.K. pound sterling, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on our Asia Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency fluctuations. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. The Company currently expects acquisitions and divestitures to have an 18 percent to 19 percent unfavorable impact on full year 2017 net operating revenues. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect currencies will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2017 net operating revenues. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32; \n\nThe Company's net operating revenues decreased $1,704 million, or 4 percent. \n\nThe following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues for each of our operating segments: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPercent Change 2015 vs. 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions &#38; Divestitures \n\n&#160; \n\nPrice, Product &#38; \n\nGeographic Mix \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency \n\nFluctuations \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nConsolidated \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n)% \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n)% \n\nLatin America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n) \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\nBottling Investments \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\nCorporate \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n* \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n* Calculation is not meaningful. \n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nRepresents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes.

Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency fluctuations. For additional information about the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nGross Profit Margin \n\nAs a result of our finished goods operations, which are primarily included in our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments, the following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The Company enters into hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures, including any related foreign currency exposure, do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded gains related to these derivatives of $79 million &#32;during the year ended December 31, 2016 &#32;and losses of $206 million &#32;and $8 million &#32;during the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not currently expect changes in commodity costs to have a significant impact on our 2017 gross profit margin as compared to 2016. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2016 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 \n\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.7 percent in 2016 from 60.5 percent in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the impact of positive price mix and lower commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 \n\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 60.5 percent in 2015 from 61.1 percent in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by positive price mix and slightly lower commodity costs. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nAdvertising expenses \n\n4,004 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,976 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,499 \n\nSelling and distribution expenses \n\n5,177 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,025 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,412 \n\nOther operating expenses \n\n5,823 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,190 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,098 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n$ \n\n15,262 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,427 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,218 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2016 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,165 million, or 7 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2016, fluctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 2 percent. The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency exchange impact of 3 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses reflects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to divestitures. \n\nIn 2016 , the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $238 million , which primarily included $86 million of net periodic benefit cost and $155 million of settlement charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2017, we expect our total pension expense to be $366 million, which includes $41 million of net periodic benefit cost and $325 million of estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in 2017 expected net periodic benefit cost is due to favorable asset performance in 2016 compared to our expected return, partially offset by a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the U.S. plans and a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\" below for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#8212; Pension Plan Valuations\" above and Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the pension plan assumptions used by the Company. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016 , we had $ 267 million &#32;of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $791 million, or 5 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2015, fluctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 percent. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to reversals in 2014 of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive programs as performance criteria were not achieved. The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency exchange impact of 13 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses reflects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nOther Operating Charges \n\nOther operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nLatin America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNorth America \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottling Investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n1,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,183 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2016, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,510 million . These charges primarily consisted of $352 million &#32;due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and $240 million &#32;due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company recorded charges of $297 million &#32;related to costs incurred to refranchise certain of our bottling operations. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance and costs associated with the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems. Additionally, the Company recorded $118 million &#32;of pension settlement charges primarily as a result of our refranchising activities. The Company also recorded a charge of $200 million &#32;related to cash contributions we made to The Coca-Cola Foundation, a charge of $76 million &#32;due to the write-down we recorded related to our receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela as a result of changes in exchange rates and charges of $41 million &#32;related to noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with pending and closed transactions.

These charges included $143 million &#32;related to the impairment of certain U.S. bottlers' franchise rights recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was related to a number of factors, primarily as a result of lower operating performance compared to previously modeled results as well as a revision in management's view of the proceeds that may be ultimately received upon refranchising the territory. The remaining charge of $10 million &#32;was related to the impairment of goodwill recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment. This charge was primarily the result of management's revised outlook on market conditions. The total impairment charges of $153 million &#32;were recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income and were determined by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets, derived using discounted cash flow analyses, to their respective carrying values. \n\nIn 2015, the Company incurred other operating charges of $1,657 million . These charges included $ 691 million &#32;due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and $ 292 million &#32;due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges of $418 million &#32;primarily due to the discontinuation of the energy products in the glac&#233;au portfolio as a result of the Monster Transaction and incurred a charge of $100 million &#32;due to a cash contribution we made to The Coca-Cola Foundation. The Company also incurred a charge of $ 111 million &#32;due to the write-down we recorded related to receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela and an impairment of a Venezuelan trademark primarily due to changes in exchange rates as a result of the establishment of the new open market exchange system.

These charges primarily consisted of $601 million &#32;due to the Company's productivity and reinvestment program and $208 million &#32;due to the integration of our German bottling operations. In addition, the Company incurred a charge of $314 million &#32;due to a write-down we recorded related to receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela and an impairment of a Venezuelan trademark primarily due to higher exchange rates. The write-down was recorded as a result of our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of the Venezuelan bolivar into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables. The Company also recorded a loss of $36 million &#32;as a result of the restructuring and transition of the Company's Russian juice operations to an existing joint venture with an unconsolidated bottling partner.

This program is focused on the following initiatives: global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s (\"Old CCE\") former North America business. \n\nIn February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental productivity by 2016 that will primarily be redirected into increased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain optimization, data and information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth. \n\nIn October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019. The expansion of the productivity initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles, across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. The Company expects that the expanded productivity initiatives will generate an incremental $2 billion in annualized productivity. This productivity will enable the Company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth and will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. We expect to achieve total annualized productivity of approximately $ 3.6 billion &#32;by 2019 from the initiatives implemented under this program since it began in 2012 and have incurred total pretax expenses of $ 2,408 million &#32;since the program commenced. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIntegration of Our German Bottling Operations \n\nIn 2008, the Company began the integration of our German bottling operations acquired in 2007. Since the integration commenced, the Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $ 1,367 million &#32;primarily related to involuntary terminations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's operating income was unfavorably impacted by the sale of the Company&#8217;s energy brands as part of the Monster Transaction which closed on June 12, 2015. The sale of the energy brands unfavorably impacted our Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the North America refranchising and the Monster Transaction. \n\nIn 2016, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 8 percent due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the South African rand, euro, U.K. pound sterling, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Bottling Investments and Corporate operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on our Asia Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nOperating income for Europe, Middle East and Africa for the years ended December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was $3,676 million &#32;and $3,875 million , respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted operating income by 3 percent and the segment was also unfavorably impacted by an increase in other operating charges and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable product mix and geographic mix. \n\nOperating income for the Latin America segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was $1,951 million &#32;and $2,169 million , respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted operating income by 27 percent and the segment was also unfavorably impacted by an increase in other operating charges. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable price mix in all of the segment's business units. \n\nNorth America's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was $2,582 million &#32;and $2,366 million , respectively. The increase in the segment's operating income was due to price increases and favorable package mix and a decrease in other operating charges, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nOperating income in Asia Pacific for the years ended December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was $2,224 million &#32;and $2,189 million , respectively. Operating income for the segment reflects an increase in concentrate sales partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nOur Bottling Investments segment's operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 &#32;was $137 million , compared to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;of $124 million . The Bottling Investments segment was unfavorably impacted by an increase in other operating charges and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by a favorable impact of 1 percent due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nThe Corporate segment's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was $1,670 million &#32;and $1,995 million , respectively. Operating loss in 2016 was favorably impacted by a decrease in other operating charges, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 2 percent due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 \n\nIn 2015, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 12 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the South African rand, euro, U.K. pound sterling, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's operating income was unfavorably impacted by the refranchising of additional bottling territories in North America and the sale of the Company's energy brands as part of the Monster Transaction. The refranchising activities unfavorably impacted our Bottling Investments operating segment, and the sale of the energy brands unfavorably impacted our Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nOperating income for Europe, Middle East and Africa for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $3,875 million &#32;and $3,936 million , respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted operating income by 7 percent, partially offset by favorable price mix in most of the segment's business units. \n\nOperating income in Latin America for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $2,169 million &#32;and $2,316 million , respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted operating income by 31 percent, partially offset by a reduction in other operating charges and favorable price mix in all of the segment's business units. \n\nNorth America's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $2,366 million &#32;and $2,243 million , respectively. The segment was favorably impacted by price increases and product and package mix. \n\nOperating income in Asia Pacific for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $2,189 million &#32;and $2,448 million , respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impacted operating income by 8 percent. \n\nOur Bottling Investments segment's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $124 million &#32;and $213 million , respectively. The Bottling Investments segment was unfavorably impacted by an increase in other operating charges partially offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nThe Corporate segment's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $1,995 million &#32;and $1,448 million , respectively.

The increase primarily reflects higher cash balances and higher average interest rates in certain of our international locations, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32; \n\nInterest income was $ 613 million &#32;in 2015 , compared to $ 594 million &#32;in 2014 , an increase of $19 million, or 3 percent. The increase primarily reflects higher average cash and investment balances and higher average interest rates in certain of our international locations, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2016 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 \n\nInterest expense was $ 733 million &#32;in 2016 , compared to $ 856 million &#32;in 2015 , a decrease of $123 million, or 14 percent. Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of recently issued long-term debt and interest rate swaps on our fixed-rate debt. Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 included charges of $320 million the Company recorded on the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationship. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's hedging program. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Cash Flows from Financing Activities &#8212; Debt Financing\" below and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32; \n\nInterest expense was $ 856 million &#32;in 2015 , compared to $ 483 million &#32;in 2014 , an increase of $373 million, or 77 percent. The increase is primarily due to charges of $320 million the Company recorded on the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. Interest expense also increased as a result of an overall increase in the total debt balances and a shift in the mix of our debt portfolio from short-term to long-term debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued SFr 1,325 million , &#8364; 8,500 million &#32;and $4,000 million &#32;of long-term debt.

In 2016 , equity income was $ 835 million , compared to equity income of $ 489 million &#32;in 2015 , an increase of $346 million, or 71 percent. This increase reflects, among other items, more favorable operating results reported by several of our equity method investees, the impact of the June 2015 investment in Monster, as well as our newly acquired investments in CCEP, CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary. The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies and the derecognition of the Company's former equity method investment in South Africa. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Monster Transaction and our newly acquired investments in CCEP, CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary. \n\nYear Ended &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32;versus Year Ended &#32; December 31, 2014 &#32; \n\nIn 2015 , equity income was $ 489 million , compared to equity income of $ 769 million &#32;in 2014 , a decrease of $280 million, or 36 percent. This decrease reflects, among other items, the unfavorable impact of the challenging economic conditions around the world where many of our equity method investees operate and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies. The impact of these items was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of equity method investments. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nOther Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nOther income (loss) &#8212; net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses; dividend income; rental income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to business combinations and disposals; realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities; and other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn 2016, other income (loss) &#8212; net was a loss of $1,234 million . This loss included losses of $2,456 million &#32;due to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North America and a loss of $21 million &#32;due to the deconsolidation of our South African bottling operations and disposal of the related equity method investment in exchange for investments in CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary. The Company incurred charges of $31 million &#32;related to payments made to convert the bottling agreements for certain North America bottling partners' territories to a single form of CBA with additional requirements. Additionally, the Company incurred net foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million, including a charge of $72 million &#32;as a result of remeasuring its net monetary assets denominated in Egyptian pounds. The Egyptian pound devalued as a result of the central bank allowing its currency, which was previously pegged to the U.S. dollar, to float freely. These losses were partially offset by a gain of $1,323 million &#32;due to the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations, dividend income of $55 million, net gains of $83 million related to trading securities and available-for-sale securities and a gain of $18 million &#32;resulting from the Company's disposal of its investment in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (\"Keurig\"). Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the North America refranchising, the deconsolidation of our South African bottling operations, the conversion payments, the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations and the Keurig investment disposal. Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these items had on our operating segments. \n\nIn 2015, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $631 million . This income included a net gain of $1,403 million as a result the Monster Transaction, primarily due to the difference in the recorded carrying value of the assets transferred, including an allocated portion of goodwill, compared to the value of the total assets and business acquired. Other income (loss) &#8212; net also included net foreign currency exchange gains of $149 million and dividend income of $83 million. This income was partially offset by noncash losses of $1,006 million due to refranchising activities in North America. The net foreign currency exchange gains included a gain of $300 million associated with our foreign-denominated debt partially offset by a charge of $27 million due to the initial remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SIMADI exchange rate. The Company determined that based on its economic circumstances, the SIMADI rate best represented the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled, including the payment of dividends. As such, the Company remeasured the net assets related to its operations in Venezuela using the current SIMADI rate. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Monster Transaction and North America refranchising. Refer to the heading \"Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange\" below and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the charge due to the change in Venezuelan exchange rates. \n\nIn 2014, other income (loss) &#8212; net was a loss of $1,263 million , primarily due to noncash losses of $799 million &#32;related to the refranchising of certain bottling territories in North America and net foreign currency exchange losses of $569 million, including a charge of $ 372 million &#32;due to the remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. These charges were partially offset by dividend income of $51 million and net gains of $45 million related to fluctuations in the carrying value of the Company's trading securities and sales of available-for-sale securities. Refer to Note 1, Note 2 &#32;and Note 17 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent . As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Swaziland. The terms of these grants expire from 2017 &#32;to 2036 . We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $ 105 million , $ 223 million &#32;and $ 265 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively.

If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $ 179 million , exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $ 123 million , which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. \n\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions \n\n1 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\nIncrease related to current period tax positions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities \n\n(40 \n\n) \n\n1 &#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nDecrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\nIncrease (decrease) due to effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes \n\n(6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nThe increase is primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company&#8217;s tax positions as a result of receiving notification of a preliminary settlement of a Competent Authority matter with a foreign jurisdiction, a portion of which became certain later in the year. This change in position did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2016, as it was partially offset by refunds to be received from the foreign jurisdiction. \n\n##TABLE_END The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had $ 142 million , $ 111 million &#32;and $ 113 million &#32;in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Of these amounts, $31 million &#32;and $ 8 million &#32;of expense were recognized through income tax expense in 2016 and 2014 , respectively. An insignificant amount of interest and penalties were recognized through income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate. \n\nBased on current tax laws, the Company's effective tax rate in 2017 is expected to be 24.0 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate. \n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position \n\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Operating Activities\" below. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2017. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" below. We have a history of borrowing funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. In addition, our domestic entities have recently borrowed and continue to have the ability to borrow funds in international markets at reasonable interest rates. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. In addition to the Company's cash balances, commercial paper program, and our ability to issue long-term debt, we also had $ 8,170 million &#32;in lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2016 . These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2017 &#32;through 2022 . \n\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 81 percent &#32;of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2016. We earn a substantial amount of our consolidated operating income and income before income taxes in foreign subsidiaries that either sell concentrate to our local bottling partners or, in certain instances, sell finished products directly to our customers to fulfill the demand for Company beverage products outside the United States. A significant portion of these foreign earnings is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal and state income taxes have been provided on the portion of our foreign earnings that is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. The Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $20.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 . With the exception of an insignificant amount, for which U.S. federal and state income taxes have already been provided, we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. \n\nNet operating revenues in the United States were $19.9 billion in 2016, or 48 percent of the Company's consolidated net operating revenues. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and the issuance of debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund significant discretionary activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This alternative could result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. This alternative could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. \n\nBased on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. These obligations and anticipated cash outflows include, but are not limited to, regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, capital expenditures, share repurchases and obligations included under the heading \"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\" below. \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $ 8,796 million , $ 10,528 million &#32;and $ 10,615 million , respectively. \n\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $1,732 million, or 16 percent, in 2016 &#32;compared to 2015 . This decrease included the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of $471 million in incremental contributions made to the Company's pension plans and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The impact of these items was partially offset by lower income tax payments. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Net Operating Revenues\" above for additional information on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax payments. \n\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $87 million, or 1 percent, in 2015 &#32;compared to 2014 . This decrease primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and an increase in tax payments, partially offset by the efficient management of working capital. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Net Operating Revenues\" above for additional information on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax payments. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of investments \n\n$ \n\n(15,499 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(15,831 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(17,800 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of investments \n\n16,624 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,079 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,986 \n\nAcquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities \n\n(838 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,491 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(389 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities \n\n1,035 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment \n\n(2,262 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,553 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,406 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investing activities \n\n(209 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(40 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(268 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \n\n$ \n\n(999 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(6,186 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(7,506 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments \n\nIn 2016 , purchases of investments were $ 15,499 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of investments were $ 16,624 million . This activity resulted in a net cash inflow of $1,125 million during 2016 . In 2015 , purchases of investments were $ 15,831 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of investments were $ 14,079 million , resulting in a net cash outflow of $1,752 million. In 2014 , purchases of investments were $ 17,800 million &#32;and proceeds from disposals of investments were $ 12,986 million , resulting in a net cash outflow of $4,814 million. These investments include time deposits that have maturities greater than three months but less than one year and are classified in the line item short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. The disposals in 2016 include the disposal of the Company's investment in Keurig. The purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 include our investments in Keurig of $830 million and $1,567 million, respectively. The remaining activity primarily represents the purchases of and proceeds from short-term investments that were made as part of the Company's overall cash management strategy. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our investment in Keurig. \n\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities \n\nIn 2016 , the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 838 million , which primarily related to our acquisition of Xiamen Culiangwang Beverage Technology Co., Ltd., a maker of plant-based protein beverages in China, and a minority investment in CHI Limited, a Nigerian producer of value-added dairy and juice beverages. Under the terms of the agreement related to our investment in CHI Limited, the Company is obligated to acquire the remaining ownership interest from the existing shareowners in 2019 based on an agreed-upon formula. \n\nIn 2015 , the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 2,491 million , which primarily included our equity investments in Monster and in Indonesian bottling operations and the acquisition of a controlling interest in a South African bottling operation. \n\nIn 2014 , the Company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $ 389 million , which primarily included a joint investment with one of our bottling partners in a dairy company in Ecuador. \n\nRefer to Note 2 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the years ended &#32; December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . \n\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities \n\nIn 2016 , proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $ 1,035 million , primarily related to proceeds from the refranchising of certain of our bottling territories in North America. \n\nIn 2015 , proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $565 million , which included cash received as a result of a Brazilian bottling entity's majority interest owners exercising their option to acquire from us an additional equity interest. The proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities during 2015 also included the proceeds from the refranchising of certain of our bottling territories in North America. \n\nIn 2014 , proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities were $148 million , which represented the proceeds from the refranchising of certain of our bottling territories in North America. \n\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . \n\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment net of disposals for the years ended &#32; December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were $2,112 million, $2,468 million and $2,183 million, respectively. \n\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital expenditures \n\n$ \n\n2,262 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,553 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,406 \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n% \n\nLatin America \n\n2.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.3 \n\nNorth America \n\n19.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n14.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n15.2 \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\nBottling Investments \n\n58.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n66.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n64.6 \n\nCorporate \n\n12.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n11.2 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe expect our annual 2017 capital expenditures to be $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion as we continue to make investments to enable growth in our business and further enhance our operational effectiveness. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nIn 2016, cash used in other investing activities was primarily related to the cash flow impact of the Company's derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and the purchases of trademarks. \n\nIn 2015, cash used in other investing activities included a $530 million payment related to the Monster Transaction, partially offset by the cash flow impact of the Company's derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Monster Transaction and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges. \n\nIn 2014, cash used in other investing activities was primarily related to loans to Fairlife, LLC, a value-added dairy joint venture, as well as local investments in Argentina. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nOur cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIssuances of debt \n\n$ \n\n27,281 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n40,434 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n41,674 \n\nPayments of debt \n\n(25,615 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(37,738 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(36,962 \n\n) \n\nIssuances of stock \n\n1,434 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,245 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,532 \n\nPurchases of stock for treasury \n\n(3,681 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,564 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,162 \n\n) \n\nDividends \n\n(6,043 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,741 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,350 \n\n) \n\nOther financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(363 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities \n\n$ \n\n(6,545 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(5,113 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(3,631 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDebt Financing \n\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated \"AA-\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"Aa3\" by Moody's and \"A+\" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated \"A-1+\" by Standard &#38; Poor's, \"P-1\" by Moody's and \"F1\" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or \n\nfor any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers. \n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. \n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. \n\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. In 2016, the Company had issuances of debt of $27,281 million , which included net issuances of $773 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $21,525 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $4,983 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. Refer below for additional details on our long-term debt issuances. \n\nDuring 2016, the Company made payments of debt of $25,615 million , which included $22,920 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $2,695 million. \n\nIn 2015, the Company had issuances of debt of $40,434 million, which included net issuances of $25,923 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $14,511 million, net of related discounts, premiums and issuance costs. \n\nDuring 2015, the Company made payments of $37,738 million, which included net payments of $208 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $31,711 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt payments of $5,819 million. The long-term debt payments included the extinguishment of $2,039 million &#32;of long-term debt prior to maturity, which resulted in associated charges of $320 million &#32;that were recorded in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationship. \n\nIn 2014, the Company had issuances of debt of $41,674 million, which included net issuances of $317 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $37,799 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $3,558 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. \n\nDuring 2014, the Company made payments of debt of $36,962 million, which included $35,921 million for payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days or less and long-term debt payments of $1,041 million. \n\nThe carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from Old CCE of $ 361 million &#32;and $ 411 million &#32;as of December 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. These fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years remaining until the underlying debt matures. As of December 31, 2016 , the weighted-average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 21 years. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $ 663 million , $ 515 million &#32;and $ 498 million &#32;in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt balances. \n\nIssuances of Stock \n\nThe issuances of stock in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nIn 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 500 million shares of the Company's common stock. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of shares repurchased (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage price per share \n\n$ \n\n43.62 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n41.33 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n40.97 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSince the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2016 , we have purchased 3.4 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $16.08. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2016, we repurchased $3.7 billion of our stock. The net impact of the Company's treasury stock issuance and purchase activities in 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow of $2.2 billion. We currently expect to repurchase approximately $2.0 billion of our stock during 2017, net of proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock due to the exercise of employee stock options. \n\nDividends \n\nThe Company paid dividends of $6,043 million , $5,741 million &#32;and $5,350 million &#32;during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. \n\nAt its February 2017 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 6 percent, raising it to $0.37 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.48 per share in 2017. This is our 55 th &#32;consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $ 1.40 &#32;per share, $ 1.32 &#32;per share and $ 1.22 &#32;per share in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The 2016 &#32;dividend represented a 6 percent increase from 2015 , and the 2015 &#32;dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 2014 . \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation under certain guarantee contracts; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation under certain derivative instruments; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nany obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. \n\n##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2016 , we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $ 587 million , of which $ 247 million &#32;was related to VIEs. These guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2016 , we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. \n\nOur Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAggregate Contractual Obligations \n\nAs of December 31, 2016 , the Company's contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2018-2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n2020-2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n2022 and \n\nThereafter \n\nShort-term loans and notes payable: 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommercial paper borrowings \n\n$ \n\n12,330 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,330 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nLines of credit and other short-term borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt 2 \n\n3,524 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,524 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities 2 \n\n29,418 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n6,552 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,634 \n\n&#160; \n\n16,232 \n\nEstimated interest payments 3 \n\n5,687 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,335 \n\nAccrued income taxes 4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations 5 \n\n14,741 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,148 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,428 \n\nMarketing obligations 6 \n\n3,973 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,232 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLease obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHeld-for-sale obligations 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n$ \n\n71,653 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,922 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,929 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,066 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,736 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 10 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be paid by the Company in future periods and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including the fair market value mark up, unamortized discounts and premiums. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 &#160; \n\nWe calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2016 &#32;rate for all years presented. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4 &#160; \n\nRefer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2016 , the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was $439 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5 &#160; \n\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6 &#160; \n\nWe expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 7 &#160; \n\nRepresents liabilities of the Company's North America bottling territories and China bottling operations that are classified as held for sale. \n\n##TABLE_END The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2016 , was $2,336 million. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. \n\nWe generally expect to fund all future pension contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016 , the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $6,531 million, and the fair value of the related plan assets was $6,061 million. The projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $2,897 million, and the fair value of the related plan assets was $2,310 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as certain unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be $69 million in 2017, increasing to $76 million by 2024 and then decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company expects to contribute $106 million &#32;in 2017 to our global pension plans, the majority of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. \n\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2016 , our self-insurance reserves totaled $ 527 million . Refer to Note 11 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above. \n\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 &#32;were $4,445 million . Refer to Note 14 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. \n\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had entered into agreements related to the following future investing activities which are not included in the table above: \n\nUnder the terms of the agreement for our investment in CHI Limited, the Company is obligated to acquire the remaining ownership interest from the existing shareowners in 2019 based on an agreed-upon formula. \n\nUnder the terms of agreements with certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in the United States, the Company is obligated to make payments to each of these bottlers upon the conversion of their bottling agreements to a comprehensive beverage agreement with additional requirements. We currently expect these conversions to occur during 2017. \n\nThe Company and ABI have reached an agreement regarding the transition of ABI's stake in CCBA for an equity value of $3,150 million , after customary adjustments. The Company has also agreed in principle to acquire ABI's interest in bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras. The Company will negotiate the terms of this transaction with ABI according to the contractual parameters. The transactions are subject to the relevant regulatory and minority approvals and are expected to close by the end of 2017. \n\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. \n\nIn 2016 , we used 73 functional currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAll operating currencies \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\nBrazilian real \n\n(9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n)% \n\nMexican peso \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\nAustralian dollar \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\nSouth African rand \n\n(13 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(12 \n\n) \n\nBritish pound \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nEuro \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nJapanese yen \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThese percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. \n\nThe total currency impacts on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, were decreases of 3 percent and 7 percent in 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. The total currency impacts on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, were decreases of 12 percent in 2016 and 6 percent in 2015. \n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading \"Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net\" above. The Company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million in 2016 , foreign currency exchange gains of $149 million in 2015 &#32;and foreign currency exchange losses of $569 million in 2014 . \n\nHyperinflationary Economies \n\nA hyperinflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of 100 percent &#32;or more over a three-year period. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, local subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies are required to use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in U.S. dollars using the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently in income. \n\nVenezuela has been designated as a hyperinflationary economy. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government recognized three legal exchange rates to convert bolivars to the U.S. dollar: (1) the official rate of 6.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar; (2) SICAD 1, which was available to foreign investments and designated industry sectors to exchange a limited volume of bolivars for U.S. dollars using a bid rate established at weekly auctions; and (3) SICAD 2, which applied to transactions that did not qualify for either the official rate or SICAD 1. As of March 28, 2014, the three legal exchange rates were 6.3 &#32;(official rate), 10.8 &#32;(SICAD 1) and 50.9 &#32;(SICAD 2). We determined that the SICAD 1 rate was the most appropriate rate to use for remeasurement given our circumstances and estimates of the applicable rate at which future transactions could be settled, including the payment of dividends. Therefore, as of March 28, 2014, we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using an exchange rate of 10.8 &#32;bolivars per U.S. dollar, resulting in a charge of $226 million &#32;recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nIn December 2014, due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty, the Company reevaluated the rate that should be used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2014, we determined that the SICAD 2 rate of 50 &#32;bolivars per U.S. dollar was the most appropriate legally available rate and remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $146 million &#32;recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nIn February 2015, the Venezuelan government merged SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 into a single mechanism called SICAD and introduced a new open market exchange rate system, SIMADI. As a result, management determined that the SIMADI rate was the most appropriate legally available rate and remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $27 million &#32;recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nWe also have certain U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. As a result of the Company's revised expectations regarding the convertibility of the local currency, we recognized impairment charges of $55 million &#32;and $18 million &#32;during the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , respectively. These charges were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and changed its official and most preferential exchange rate, which should be used for purchases of certain essential goods, to 10 &#32;bolivars per U.S. dollar from 6.3 . The official and most preferential rate is now known as DIPRO and the SICAD rate has been eliminated. The Venezuelan government replaced the SIMADI rate with the DICOM rate, which is allowed to float freely and is expected to fluctuate based on supply and demand. As a result, management determined that the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate to remeasure the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. \n\nIn addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiary's net monetary assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , as a result of the continued lack of liquidity and our revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to realize upon the conversion of Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars by our bottling partner to pay our concentrate sales receivables, we recorded write-downs of $76 million , $56 million &#32;and $296 million , respectively. These write-downs were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016 , the combined carrying value of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, the receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela and the intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela was $84 million . The Company's ability to pay dividends from Venezuela is restricted due to the low volume of U.S. dollars available for conversion. As a result of the floating DICOM rate, the Company expects to continue to record losses on foreign currency exchange, may incur additional write-downs of receivables or impairment charges and will continue to record our proportionate share of any charges recorded by our equity method investee that has operations in Venezuela. \n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices \n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. \n\nOverview of Financial Position \n\nThe following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Company's consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent Change \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n8,555 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,309 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,246 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nShort-term investments \n\n9,595 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,273 \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketable securities \n\n4,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,269 \n\n&#160; \n\n(218 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nTrade accounts receivable &#8212; net \n\n3,856 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n(85 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\nInventories \n\n2,675 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,902 \n\n&#160; \n\n(227 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\nPrepaid expenses and other assets \n\n2,481 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,752 \n\n&#160; \n\n(271 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\nAssets held for sale \n\n2,797 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,900 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,103 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(28 \n\n) \n\nEquity method investments \n\n16,260 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,318 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,942 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investments \n\n&#160; \n\n3,470 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,481 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(71 \n\n) \n\nOther assets \n\n4,248 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,110 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, plant and equipment &#8212; net \n\n10,635 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,571 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,936 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\nTrademarks with indefinite lives \n\n6,097 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,989 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBottlers' franchise rights with indefinite lives \n\n3,676 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,324 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(39 \n\n) \n\nGoodwill \n\n10,629 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,289 \n\n&#160; \n\n(660 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n) \n\nOther intangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(128 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\nTotal assets \n\n$ \n\n87,270 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n89,996 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,726 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n)% \n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses \n\n$ \n\n9,490 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,660 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(170 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\nLoans and notes payable \n\n12,498 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,129 \n\n&#160; \n\n(631 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt \n\n3,527 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,676 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAccrued income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(24 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\nLiabilities held for sale \n\n&#160; \n\n1,133 \n\n&#160; \n\n(423 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(37 \n\n) \n\nLong-term debt \n\n29,684 \n\n&#160; \n\n28,311 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,373 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther liabilities \n\n4,081 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,301 \n\n&#160; \n\n(220 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\nDeferred income taxes \n\n3,753 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,691 \n\n&#160; \n\n(938 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(20 \n\n) \n\nTotal liabilities \n\n$ \n\n64,050 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n64,232 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(182 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\nNet assets \n\n$ \n\n23,220 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,764 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,544 \n\n) \n\n1 &#160; \n\n(10 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 1 &#160; \n\nIncludes a decrease in net assets of $626 million &#32;resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. \n\n##TABLE_END The increases (decreases) in the table above include the impact of the following transactions and events: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAssets held for sale and liabilities held for sale decreased primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Company's German and South African bottling operations which were previously classified as held for sale, partially offset by the Company's China bottling operations and additional North America bottling territories being reclassified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nEquity method investments increased primarily as a result of the Company's new investments in CCEP, CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary, partially offset by the derecognition of the Company's former equity method investment in South Africa. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther investments decreased primarily due to the disposal of the Company's investment in Keurig, which was accounted for as an available-for-sale security. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProperty, plant and equipment and bottlers' franchise rights decreased primarily as a result of additional North America bottling territories being refranchised or reclassified as held for sale as well as the Company's China bottling operations being reclassified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLong-term debt increased due to the Company's recent issuances of Australian dollar-, euro- and U.S. dollar-denominated debt, partially offset by a portion of the Company's long-term debt maturing within the next 12 months and being reclassified as current. Refer to the heading \"Cash Flows from Financing Activities\" above for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeferred income taxes decreased primarily due to the impact of refranchising certain bottling operations.
