The EPS decrease in fiscal 2017 &#32;was due to lower segment operating income at Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media and higher net interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, higher operating income at Parks and Resorts and a decrease in the effective tax rate. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (FX Impact). \n\nRevenues \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2017 &#32; decreased &#32; 1% , or $0.3 billion , to $46.8 billion , due to declines in revenue from theatrical and home entertainment distribution, advertising and merchandise licensing. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit from a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened in June 2016, an increase in affiliate fees and higher average guest spending and attendance growth at our other parks and resorts. Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2017 &#32; decreased &#32; 2% , or $0.2 billion , to $8.3 billion , due to lower volumes at our home entertainment distribution and retail businesses and the discontinuation of Infinity, partially offset by the impact of a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and higher average guest spending and volumes at our other parks and resorts. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nCosts and expenses \n\nCost of services for fiscal 2017 &#32; increased &#32; 3% , or $0.7 billion , to $25.3 billion , due to higher sports programming costs, a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and new guest offerings and inflation at our other parks and resorts. These increases were partially offset by lower film cost amortization and theatrical distribution costs. \n\nCost of products for fiscal 2017 &#32; decreased &#32; 7% , or $0.4 billion , to $5.0 billion , due to the discontinuation of Infinity, the absence of the Infinity Charge (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower retail and home entertainment volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for the fiscal year decreased &#32; 7% , or $0.6 billion , to $8.2 billion , due to lower theatrical marketing costs and the discontinuation of Infinity. Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable FX Impact. \n\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased &#32; 10% , or $0.3 billion , to $2.8 billion &#32;primarily due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $98 million &#32;and $156 million &#32;of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2017 &#32;were due to severance costs and asset impairments. Charges in fiscal 2016 &#32;were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs. \n\nOther Income, net \n\nOther income, net is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\nGain related to the acquisition of BAMTech \n\n$ \n\nSettlement of litigation \n\n(177 \n\n) \n\nOther income, net \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a charge, net of committed insurance recoveries, in connection with the settlement of litigation. \n\nInterest Expense, net \n\nInterest expense, net is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(507 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(354 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(43 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and investment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(385 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(260 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(48 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances, lower capitalized interest and an increase in our effective interest rate. \n\nThe increase in interest and investment income for the year was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by an increase in average cash balances in interest bearing accounts and higher interest rates. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nEquity in the income of investees decreased &#32; 65% &#32;or $606 million , to $0.3 billion &#32;due to the absence of the $332 million Vice Gain (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which was recognized in the prior year, and higher losses from our investments in BAMTech and Hulu. The BAMTech results reflected a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to our acquisition of BAMTech and increased costs for technology platform investments. The decrease at Hulu was due to higher programming, distribution, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and subscription revenues. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nEffective income tax rate \n\n32.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n34.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\nppt \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to lower tax on foreign earnings, a favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement related to the tax impact of employee share-based awards ($125 million) (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and an increase in the benefit related to qualified domestic production activities. These decreases were partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. The lower tax on foreign earnings was driven by a decrease in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year decreased &#32; $13 million &#32;to $386 million &#32;due to the impact of lower net income at ESPN, partially offset by the impact of improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes. \n\n2016 vs. 2015 &#32; \n\nRevenues for fiscal 2016 &#32;increased 6% , or $3.2 billion, to $55.6 billion ; net income attributable to Disney increased 12% , or $1.0 billion, to $9.4 billion ; and EPS for the year increased 17% , or $0.83 to $5.73 . The EPS increase in fiscal 2016 was due to segment operating income growth at Studio Entertainment, Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, a decrease in our effective income tax rate, which reflected a deferred tax asset write-off in fiscal 2015, and the benefit of the Vice Gain. These increases were partially offset by higher net interest expense, the Infinity Charge (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and higher restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2016. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 5 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nFiscal 2016 included fifty-two weeks of operations, while fiscal 2015 results included the benefit from a fifty-third week of operations (Fiscal Period Impact) due to the timing of our fiscal period end. The estimated EPS impact of the additional week of operations in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.13, and the majority of the impact was at our cable networks business, followed by our parks and resorts and, to a lesser extent, consumer products businesses. \n\nRevenues \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 7% , or $3.2 billion, to $47.1 billion , due to higher theatrical distribution revenues. The increase in service revenues was also driven by growth in merchandise and game licensing revenue, higher average guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and resorts and higher affiliate fees. Additionally, growth in TV/SVOD, revenues from the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, growth in digital distribution of film content and higher advertising revenue contributed to the increase in service revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower attendance at Disneyland Paris. Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased 1%, or $69 million, to $8.5 billion, due to the discontinuation of Infinity and lower retail store volumes, partially offset by higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher net effective pricing at home entertainment and revenues from the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nCosts and expenses \n\nCost of services for fiscal 2016 increased 6% , or $1.5 billion, to $24.7 billion , due to higher film cost amortization and distribution expense, increased media programming and production costs, the impact of the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort and cost inflation and higher infrastructure and labor costs at our domestic parks and resorts. These increases were partially offset by efficiency initiatives at our domestic parks and resorts. Cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable FX Impact. \n\nCost of products for fiscal 2016 increased 3% , or $167 million, to $5.3 billion , due to the Infinity Charge, higher guest spending and cost inflation at our domestic parks and resorts and higher film cost amortization due to home entertainment revenue growth, partially offset by lower costs from the discontinuation of Infinity. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2016 increased 3%, or $231 million, to $8.8 billion, driven by increased theatrical marketing costs, partially offset by lower marketing spend for our cable channels. Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable FX Impact. \n\n&#32;Depreciation and amortization costs increased 7% , or $173 million, to $2.5 billion &#32;due to the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort and depreciation of new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $156 million &#32;and $53 million &#32;of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2016 &#32;were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs. Charges in fiscal 2015 &#32;were primarily due to a contract termination and severance costs. \n\nInterest Expense, net \n\nInterest expense, net is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(354 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(265 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(34 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and investment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(36 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(260 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(117 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and an increase in our effective interest rate, partially offset by higher capitalized interest. \n\nThe decrease in interest and investment income was due to lower gains on sales of investments. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nEquity in the income of investees increased 14% or $112 million, to $0.9 billion due to the $332 million Vice Gain. The benefit of the Vice Gain was partially offset by a higher loss at Hulu and lower operating results at A+E. The increased equity loss at Hulu was due to higher programming, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenues. The decrease at A+E was due to lower advertising revenue and the impact of the conversion of the H2 channel to Viceland. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nEffective income tax rate \n\n34.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n36.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.0 \n\nppt \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a write-off of a $399 million deferred income tax asset in fiscal 2015 as a result of the increase in the Company&#8217;s ownership of Euro Disney S.C.A. in connection with the Disneyland Paris recapitalization (Disneyland Paris Tax Asset Write-off) (See Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2016 decreased $71 million to $399 million &#32;due to higher pre-opening expenses at Shanghai Disney Resort and a decrease related to Disneyland Paris, partially offset by higher results at ESPN. The decrease related to Disneyland Paris was driven by lower results, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the Company&#8217;s ownership interest. \n\nCertain Items Impacting Comparability \n\nResults for fiscal 2017 were impacted by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA $255 million non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA $177 million charge, net of committed insurance recoveries, in connection with the settlement of litigation \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges totaling $98 million \n\n##TABLE_END Results for fiscal 2016 were impacted by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe $332 million Vice Gain \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges totaling $156 million \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe $129 million Infinity Charge \n\n##TABLE_END Results for fiscal 2015 were impacted by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe $399 million Disneyland Paris Tax Asset Write-off \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges totaling $53 million \n\n##TABLE_END A summary of the impact of these items on EPS is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data) \n\nPre-Tax Income/(Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nTax Benefit/(Expense) (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter-Tax Income/(Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nEPS Favorable/(Adverse) &#160;(2) \n\nYear Ended September 30, 2017: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSettlement of litigation \n\n$ \n\n(177 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(112 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.07 \n\n) \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(98 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(67 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.04 \n\n) \n\nGain related to the acquisition of BAMTech \n\n&#160; \n\n(93 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.10 \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n(20 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(17 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.01 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended October 1, 2016: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVice Gain \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(122 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.13 \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(156 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(113 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.07 \n\n) \n\nInfinity Charge (3) \n\n(129 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(82 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.05 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.01 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended October 3, 2015: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDisneyland Paris Tax Asset Write-off \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(399 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(399 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.23 \n\n) \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(33 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.02 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(379 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(432 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.25 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nTax benefit/expense adjustments are determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item affecting comparability. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nEPS is net of noncontrolling interest share, where applicable.

The decrease at Broadcasting was due to decreases of 8% from lower network impressions and 1% from the absence of the Emmy Awards show, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. The decrease at Cable Networks was due to decreases of 6% from lower impressions and 1% from other advertising, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher rates. The decrease in impressions at Cable Networks and Broadcasting was due to lower average viewership. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue decrease d $199 million &#32;due to a decrease in program sales and an unfavorable FX Impact. The decrease in program sales was due to lower sales of cable and ABC programs. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increase d $559 million &#32;from $12,363 million &#32;to $12,922 million . At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increase d $636 million &#32;due to rate increases for NBA and, to a lesser extent, NFL and college sports programming.

Revenues at our domestic operations were unfavorably impacted by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Matthew during the current year. \n\nRevenue growth of 32% &#32;at our international operations was due to increases of 27% from higher volumes and 4% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from an unfavorable FX Impact. Higher volumes were due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and higher attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris. Higher average guest spending was driven by an increase at Disneyland Paris and higher average ticket prices at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by lower average ticket prices at Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase at Disneyland Paris was primarily due to increases in food and beverage spending, average ticket prices and average daily hotel room rates. \n\nRevenue growth of 4% &#32;at our domestic operations was primarily due to an increase of 3% from higher average guest spending due to an increase in average ticket prices for admissions to our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, as well as higher food and beverage spending and average hotel room rates. Domestic volumes were comparable to the prior year as increased attendance at Walt Disney World Resort was largely offset by lower occupied room nights at Walt Disney World \n\nResort and Disneyland Resort. At Walt Disney World Resort, available hotel room nights decreased due to refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\nParks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAttendance \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nPer Capita Guest Spending \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nHotels &#160; (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOccupancy \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAvailable Room Nights \n\n(in thousands) \n\n10,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,382 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,600 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,227 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,982 \n\nPer Room Guest Spending \n\n$317 \n\n&#160; \n\n$305 \n\n&#160; \n\n$292 \n\n&#160; \n\n$278 \n\n&#160; \n\n$312 \n\n&#160; \n\n$301 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nPer room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was primarily due to inflation and a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. Higher infrastructure costs were driven by a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in cost of sales was due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort, inflation and higher volumes. Other operating expenses, which include costs for items such as supplies, commissions and entertainment, increased due to new guest offerings and a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $37 million &#32;from $1,913 million &#32;to $1,950 million &#32;due to higher domestic marketing spend, partially offset by lower marketing spend for Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\nThe increase &#32;in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nEquity in the Loss of Investees \n\nLoss from equity investees increased $22 million to $25 million due to a higher operating loss from Disneyland Paris&#8217; 50% joint venture interest in Villages Nature. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 14% , or $476 million , to $3.8 billion &#32;due to growth at our international and domestic operations. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $9 million and $17 million of severance costs related to Parks and Resorts for fiscal years 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively that were reported in &#8220;Restructuring and impairment charges&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheatrical distribution \n\n$ \n\n2,903 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,672 \n\n&#160; \n\n(21 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nHome entertainment \n\n1,798 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other \n\n3,678 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,661 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n8,379 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,441 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(3,667 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,991 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(2,242 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,622 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(115 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(125 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n2,355 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,703 \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe decrease &#32;in theatrical distribution revenue was primarily due to the comparison of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and two Pixar titles in release in the prior year compared to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &#32;and one Pixar title in release in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by the performance of Beauty and the Beast &#32;and two Marvel titles in the current year compared to The Jungle Book &#32;and one Marvel title in the prior year. Other significant titles in the current year included Moana and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales , while the prior year included Zootopia &#32;and Alice Through the Looking Glass. \n\nLower home entertainment revenue was due to a decrease of 16% from a decline in unit sales driven by lower sales of Star Wars Classic titles and the performance of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &#32;in the current year compared to the strong performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens &#32;in the prior year. The current year also included the release of one Pixar title, compared to two Pixar titles in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the success of Moana, Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 &#32;in the current year compared to Zootopia , Captain America: Civil War &#32;and The Jungle Book , respectively, in the prior year. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was flat as increases of 5% from TV/SVOD distribution, 1% from stage plays and 1% from Lucasfilm&#8217;s special effects business were offset by a decrease of 7% from lower revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to international growth and higher domestic rates, partially offset by a decrease due to a domestic sale of Star Wars Classic titles in the prior year. Higher stage play revenue was driven by new productions opening in the current year, while higher revenue from Lucasfilm&#8217;s special effects business was driven by more projects in the current year. Lower revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment was due to the stronger performance of merchandise based on Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Frozen &#32;in the prior year, partially offset by Cars merchandise in the current year. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which decrease d $149 million , from $2,623 million &#32;to $2,474 million &#32;and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decrease d $175 million , from $1,368 million &#32;to $1,193 million . Lower film cost amortization was due to the impact of lower revenues, partially offset by a higher average amortization rate &#32; in the current year. Lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs were primarily due to a decrease in theatrical distribution costs and a decline in home entertainment unit sales. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decrease d $380 million &#32;from $2,622 million &#32;to $2,242 million &#32;primarily due to lower theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in the prior year, which also included the release of two DreamWorks titles, Pete&#8217;s Dragon &#32;and The Finest Hours . \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decrease d 13% , or $348 million &#32;to $2,355 million &#32;due to a decrease in theatrical distribution results, lower revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment and a decrease in home entertainment results.

Lower games revenue was due to the discontinuation of Infinity in the prior year and decreased licensing revenue from Star Wars: Battlefront. The decrease at our merchandise licensing business was due to lower revenue in the current year from merchandise based on Star Wars and Frozen and an unfavorable FX Impact, partially offset by a benefit from licensee settlements and higher revenue from merchandise based on Cars. The decrease at our publishing business was primarily due to lower sales of licensed and self-published books based on Star Wars and Frozen &#32;and a decrease in sales of comic books based on Star Wars. \n\nThe decrease &#32;in retail and other revenue was due to a decrease of 9% from our retail business driven by lower comparable store and online sales in our key markets, reflecting higher sales of Frozen &#32;and Star Wars merchandise in the prior year, partially offset by sales of Moana &#32;merchandise in the current year. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a $249 million &#32; decrease &#32;in cost of goods sold and distribution costs, from $1,340 million &#32;to $1,091 million , a $2 million &#32; increase &#32;in labor and occupancy costs, from $539 million &#32;to $541 million , and a $96 million &#32; decrease &#32;in product development expense, from $318 million &#32;to $ 222 million . The decrease in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to the discontinuation of Infinity, lower retail sales and the decrease in sales of books and comics. Lower product development expense was primarily due to the discontinuation of Infinity and fewer mobile games in development. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decrease d $118 million &#32;from $1,125 million &#32;to $1,007 million &#32;primarily due to the discontinuation of Infinity and a favorable FX Impact.

The increase at Cable Networks was due to a 3% increase from higher rates and a 1% increase from higher impressions, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from an unfavorable Fiscal Period Impact. The increase in impressions was due to an increase in units sold, partially offset by lower average viewership. Growth at Broadcasting was due to increases of 6% from higher network rates and 1% from the addition of the Emmy Awards show, which were largely offset by decreases of 5% from lower impressions and 2% from an unfavorable Fiscal Period Impact. The decrease in impressions was due to lower average network viewership, partially offset by higher digital impressions and an increase in network units sold. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increase d $47 million &#32;from $2,874 million &#32;to $2,921 million &#32;due to an increase in program sales, partially offset by an unfavorable FX Impact. The increase in program sales was due to higher sales of ABC programs, partially offset by lower sales of cable programs. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increase d $386 million &#32;from $11,977 million &#32;to $12,363 million . At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increase d $306 million &#32;due to a higher average amortization rate, the impact of higher program sales, as well as an increase in cost write-downs for network programming. These increases were partially offset by a favorable Fiscal Period Impact. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increase d $80 million &#32;due to rate increases for sports programming, partially offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR and the British Open, a favorable Fiscal Period Impact and a favorable FX Impact. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decrease d $164 million &#32;from $2,869 million to $2,705 million due to a favorable FX Impact and lower marketing and labor costs. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nIncome from equity investees decrease d $217 million &#32;from $814 million &#32;to $597 million &#32;due to a higher loss at Hulu and lower operating results at A+E. The decrease at Hulu was due to higher programming, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenues. The decrease at A+E was due to lower advertising revenue and the impact of the conversion of the H2 channel to Viceland. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decrease d $38 million , to $7,755 million &#32;due to lower income from equity investees and an unfavorable FX Impact, partially offset by increases at ESPN and the ABC TV Network. In addition, the Fiscal Period Impact was unfavorable to segment operating income, primarily at our cable networks business. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 3, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n16,632 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,581 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n7,057 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,683 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,689 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,264 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n5,965 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,891 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n1,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,088 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,755 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,793 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nParks and Resorts \n\nOperating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 3, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n$ \n\n14,242 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,611 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational \n\n2,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,551 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n16,974 \n\n&#160; \n\n16,162 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(10,039 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9,730 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(1,913 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,884 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(1,721 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,517 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the loss of investees \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n3,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,031 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nParks and Resorts revenues increase d 5% , or $812 million , to $17.0 billion &#32;due to increase s of $631 million at our domestic operations and $181 million at our international operations. \n\nRevenue growth of 5% &#32;at our domestic operations reflected an increase of 5% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from lower volumes. The increase in average guest spending was due to higher average ticket prices for admissions to our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, increased food, beverage and merchandise spending and higher average hotel room rates. Lower volumes reflected an unfavorable Fiscal Period Impact as well as lower unit sales at Disney Vacation Club, partially offset by higher attendance and occupied room nights on a comparable fiscal period basis. The decrease at Disney Vacation Club was due to fiscal 2015 sales of units at The Villas at Disney&#8217;s Grand Floridian Resort &#38; Spa, which sold out in fiscal 2015, and lower sales at Aulani, partially offset by higher sales at Disney&#8217;s Polynesian Villas &#38; Bungalows in fiscal 2016. \n\nRevenue growth of 7% &#32;at our international operations reflected increases of 6% from higher volumes and 4% from other revenue, partially offset by a decrease of 4% from an unfavorable FX Impact. Higher volumes were due to the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by lower attendance at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The increase from other revenue was driven by Shanghai Disney Resort, including revenues for periods prior to its grand opening. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year 2015 \n\nParks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAttendance \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nPer Capita Guest Spending \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nHotels &#160;(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOccupancy \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAvailable Room Nights (in thousands) \n\n10,382 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,644 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,600 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,473 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,982 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,117 \n\nPer Room Guest Spending \n\n$305 \n\n&#160; \n\n$295 \n\n&#160; \n\n$285 \n\n&#160; \n\n$295 \n\n&#160; \n\n$302 \n\n&#160; \n\n$295 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nPer room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was driven by the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, inflation and higher operations support costs, partially offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives and lower pension and postretirement medical costs. The increase in infrastructure costs was primarily due to the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. The increase in cost of sales was driven by higher volumes. Other operating expenses, which include costs for items such as supplies, commissions and entertainment, increased driven by the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, inflation and higher volumes. Operating expenses reflected a 2% decrease as a result of the Fiscal Period Impact, which had similar impacts on operating labor, cost of sales and infrastructure costs. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $29 million &#32;from $1,884 million &#32;to $1,913 million &#32;due to higher marketing spend for Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by lower domestic marketing spending. \n\nThe increase &#32;in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the impact of Shanghai Disney Resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 9% , or $267 million , to $3.3 billion &#32;due to growth at our domestic operations, partially offset by a decrease at our international operations. \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 3, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheatrical distribution \n\n$ \n\n3,672 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,321 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nHome entertainment \n\n2,108 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,799 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other \n\n3,661 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,246 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n9,441 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,366 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(3,991 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,050 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(31 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(2,622 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,204 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(125 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(139 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n2,703 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,973 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase &#32;in theatrical distribution revenue was primarily due to the performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens . Other significant titles in fiscal 2016 included Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory , Zootopia and The Jungle Book , whereas fiscal 2015 included Avengers: Age of Ultron , Inside Out, &#32; Big Hero 6 and Cinderella. \n\nThe increase &#32;in home entertainment revenue was due to increases of 14% from higher unit sales and 7% from higher average net effective pricing, partially offset by a decrease of 4% from an unfavorable FX Impact. The higher unit sales and net effective pricing were due to the strong performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens . Other significant titles included Inside Out , Zootopia, Captain America: Civil War, The Good Dinosaur &#32;and Ant-Man &#32;in fiscal 2016 compared to Guardians of the Galaxy , Big Hero 6, Frozen, Maleficent and &#32;Avengers: Age of Ultron &#32;in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 also reflected higher revenues from Star Wars Classic titles. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. \n\nThe increase &#32;in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to increases of 9% from TV/SVOD distribution and 7% from higher revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment, partially offset by a decrease of 3% from an unfavorable FX Impact. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to international growth, a sale of Star Wars Classic titles in fiscal 2016 and two Pixar VOD availabilities in fiscal 2016 compared to none in fiscal 2015. Higher revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment was due to the success of merchandise based on Star Wars: The Force Awakens in fiscal 2016 , &#32;partially offset by lower sales of &#32;Frozen &#32;merchandise. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which increased $833 million, from $1,790 million to $2,623 million and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increased $108 million, from $1,260 million to $1,368 million. The increase in film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher revenues and a higher average amortization rate &#32; in fiscal 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to higher theatrical distribution costs and an increase in home entertainment unit sales, partially offset by a favorable FX Impact. Higher theatrical distribution costs were primarily due to the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens &#32;in fiscal 2016, whereas fiscal 2015 had no comparable title. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $418 million &#32;from $2,204 million &#32;to $2,622 million &#32;driven by higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal 2016, including the release of two DreamWorks titles. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 37%, or $730 million &#32;to $2,703 million &#32;due to growth from theatrical and home entertainment results, an increase in TV/SVOD distribution and higher revenue share with the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment. \n\nConsumer Products &#38; Interactive Media \n\nOperating results for the Consumer Products &#38; Interactive Media segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 3, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLicensing, publishing and games \n\n$ \n\n3,819 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,850 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nRetail and other \n\n1,709 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,823 \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n5,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,673 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(2,263 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,434 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(1,125 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,172 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(175 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(183 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n1,965 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,884 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe decrease &#32;in licensing, publishing and games revenue was due to a 5% decrease from our games business, partially offset by a 4% increase from our merchandise licensing business. Lower games revenues were due to the discontinuation of the Infinity business, lower performance of our Frozen Free Fall &#32;mobile game and an unfavorable FX Impact, partially offset by revenues from Star Wars: Battlefront, &#32;which was released by a licensee in fiscal 2016. Higher merchandise licensing revenues were primarily due to the performance of merchandise based on Star Wars and Finding Dory/Nemo, partially offset by higher revenue share with the Studio Entertainment segment, a decrease in revenues from Frozen &#32;merchandise and an unfavorable FX Impact. \n\nThe decrease &#32;in retail and other revenue was primarily due to a decrease of 4% from our retail business due to lower comparable store sales in Europe and North America, an unfavorable Fiscal Period Impact and an unfavorable FX Impact, partially offset by the benefit of new stores in North America. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a $107 million decrease in cost of goods sold and distribution costs, from $1,447 million to $1,340 million, a $5 million decrease in labor and occupancy costs, from $544 million to $539 million , and a $49 million decrease in product development expense, from $367 million to $318 million . The decrease in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to the discontinuation of Infinity, lower Frozen Free Fall &#32;co-developer fees and a favorable Fiscal Period Impact, partially offset by higher average per unit costs at our retail business in North America and Europe and higher game inventory reserves. The decrease in product development expense was due to the discontinuation of Infinity. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $47 million from $1,172 million &#32;to $1,125 million &#32;due to the discontinuation of Infinity, partially offset by higher marketing costs at our merchandise licensing business. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 4% , or $81 million , to $1,965 million &#32;due to higher results at our merchandise licensing and games businesses, partially offset by a decrease at our retail business. \n\nCORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Better/(Worse) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 vs. 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 vs. 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(582 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(640 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(643 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses in fiscal 2017 decreased $58 million to $582 million &#32;from $640 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 due to lower labor costs, partially offset by higher charitable contributions. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,343 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,136 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,385 \n\nCash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,111 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,758 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,245 \n\n) \n\nCash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,959 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,220 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,801 \n\n) \n\nImpact of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(123 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(302 \n\n) \n\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(696 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,037 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 decreased &#32; 6% &#32;or $0.8 billion &#32;to $12.3 billion &#32;compared to fiscal 2016 due to a decrease in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment and an increase in pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher operating cash flow at Parks and Resorts and lower tax payments.

The increase at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to spending on new attractions at Disneyland Resort, while the increase in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort. The decrease in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower spending at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, while the decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to lower spending at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by higher spending at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. \n\nCapital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. \n\nCapital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. \n\nThe Company currently expects its fiscal 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion higher than fiscal 2017 capital expenditures of $3.6 billion &#32;due to increased investments at our domestic parks and resorts. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nDuring fiscal 2017, acquisitions of $417 million reflected the January 2017 acquisition of an additional 18% interest in BAMTech for $557 million, partially offset by $140 million of cash assumed upon the consolidation of BAMTech following the September 2017 acquisition of an additional 42% interest. In addition, other investing activities reflected a $71 million use of cash reflecting $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions. \n\nDuring fiscal 2016, acquisitions totaled $850 million due to the acquisition of a 15% interest in BAMTech and an 11% interest in Vice. In addition, other investing activities reflected a $135 million use of cash reflecting $109 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases and $74 million in premiums paid for foreign currency option contracts in connection with our commitment to acquire two new cruise ships. \n\nDuring fiscal 2015, other investing activities reflected $20 million of cash proceeds reflecting $166 million from the sale of investments and other assets, partially offset by contributions to joint ventures of $151 million. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash used in financing activities was $ 9.0 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $ 7.2 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 . The net use of cash in the current year was due to $9.4 billion &#32;of common stock repurchases and $2.4 billion &#32;in dividends, partially offset by net borrowings of $3.7 billion . The increase in cash used in financing activities compared to fiscal 2016 &#32;was due to higher common stock repurchases ( $9.4 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 &#32;compared to $7.5 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 ). \n\nCash used in financing activities was $ 7.2 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 &#32;compared to $5.8 billion &#32;in fiscal 2015 .

The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 &#32;compared to fiscal 2015 &#32;was due to higher common stock repurchases ($7.5 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2015). \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2017 , the Company&#8217;s borrowing activity was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nBorrowings \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\nActivity \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\nCommercial paper with original maturities less than three months, net (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,151 \n\nCommercial paper with original maturities greater than three months \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6,364 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,489 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,621 \n\nU.S. and European medium-term notes \n\n&#160; \n\n16,827 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,741 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,850 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n19,721 \n\nAsia Theme Parks borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n1,087 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,145 \n\nBAMTech acquisition payable &#160;(2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,581 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,581 \n\nForeign currency denominated debt and other obligations (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(514 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(215 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,170 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,556 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(7,853 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,418 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,291 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nBorrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of BAMTech. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nThe other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#8217;s bank facilities.

However, the Company&#8217;s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221;. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company&#8217;s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company&#8217;s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 30, 2017 , Moody&#8217;s Investors Service&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A+ and A-1+, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitch&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 30, 2017 , by a significant margin. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the International Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nThe Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 30, 2017 &#32;and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash.

For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFilm and Television Revenues and Costs \n\nWe expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period&#8217;s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. \n\nWith respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from \n\nother markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film&#8217;s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company&#8217;s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. \n\nWith respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company&#8217;s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, SVOD services and in home entertainment formats. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. \n\nWe expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program&#8217;s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season&#8217;s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. \n\nCosts of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company&#8217;s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies. \n\nWe reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated. \n\nWe recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. Revenues from annual pass sales are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use. \n\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. \n\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 3.88% &#32;at the end of fiscal 2017 &#32;from 3.73% &#32;at the end of fiscal 2016 &#32;to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2017 year end measurement date. The Company&#8217;s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans&#8217; liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2018 &#32;by approximately $263 million &#32;and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2017 &#32;by approximately $2.8 billion . A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $242 million &#32;and $2.3 billion , respectively. \n\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2018 &#32;annual benefit expense by approximately $127 million . \n\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments \n\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nTo determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. \n\nIn times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company&#8217;s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. \n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group&#8217;s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group&#8217;s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset&#8217;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. \n\nThe Company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22 million , $7 million &#32;and $10 million &#32;in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These impairment charges were recorded in &#8220;Restructuring and impairment charges&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nWe evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. \n\nContingencies and Litigation \n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. \n\nIncome Tax Audits \n\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company&#8217;s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company&#8217;s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are &#8220;forward-looking,&#8221; including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management&#8217;s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K. \n\n", "sentiment_score": {"Positive": 125, "Negative": 229, "Polarity": -0.29378530990456125, "Subjectivity": 0.05287528005184835}, "similarity_score": 0.9964060095185369, "nlp_result": 0}
