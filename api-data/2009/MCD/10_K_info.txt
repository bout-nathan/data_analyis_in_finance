Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOverview \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS \n\nThe Company franchises and operates McDonald&#146;s restaurants. Of the 32,478 restaurants in 117 countries at year-end 2009, 26,216 were operated by franchisees (including 19,020 operated by conventional franchisees, 3,160 operated by developmental licensees and 4,036 operated by foreign affiliated markets (affiliates)&#151;primarily in Japan) and 6,262 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&#233;cor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. \n\nWe view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. We continually review our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and affiliated) restaurants to help maximize overall performance. \n\nThe Company&#146;s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. \n\nThe business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present &#147;Other Countries &#38; Corporate&#148; that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 35%, 41% and 19% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), \n\ncollectively, account for approximately 55% of Europe&#146;s revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEA&#146;s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as &#147;major markets&#148; throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. \n\nThe Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald&#146;s restaurant business as we believe opportunities remain for long-term growth. Accordingly, in 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox) for total consideration of $140 million. In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger for cash proceeds of $229 million. In connection with both sales, the Company recognized nonoperating gains. During 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result of the disposal, Boston Market&#146;s results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had disposed of all non-McDonald&#146;s restaurant businesses. \n\nIn analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company&#146;s underlying business trends. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company&#146;s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. McDonald&#146;s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company&#146;s financial performance because these sales are the \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. \n\n##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\nThe strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald&#146;s success over the years. This business model enables McDonald&#146;s to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers&#146; changing needs and preferences. \n\nMcDonald&#146;s customer-focused Plan to Win&#151;which is centered around being better, not just bigger&#151;provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences&#151;People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion&#151;we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown sales and customer visits in each of the last six years. This Plan, coupled with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for shareholders. \n\nWe have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plan&#146;s implementation in 2003, after adjusting 2007 for the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable, while keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of shareholders. \n\nIn 2009, we continued to elevate the customer experience by remaining focused on the Company&#146;s key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience and daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Locally-relevant initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales, customer visits and market share in many countries despite challenging global economies and a contracting informal eating out market. As a result, each reportable segment contributed to 2009 global comparable sales and guest counts, which increased 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. \n\nIn the U.S., we grew sales and market share with comparable sales up for the 7th consecutive year, rising 2.6% in 2009. This performance was the result of a continued focus on classic menu favorites such as the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder, increased emphasis on everyday affordability, and the national marketing launch of the new McCaf&#233; premium coffees and premium Angus Third Pounder. Complementing these efforts were our strategies \n\nrelated to convenient locations, extended hours, efficient drive-thru service and value-oriented local beverage promotions. In conjunction with the introduction of the McCaf&#233; premium coffees, reinvestment was needed in many restaurants to accommodate the new equipment required to prepare these beverages as well as facilitate the national introduction of smoothies and frapp&#233;s in mid-2010. In most cases, this reinvestment involved expanding and optimizing the efficiency of the drive-thru booth, enabling us to better serve even more customers faster. \n\nIn Europe, comparable sales rose 5.2%, marking the 6th consecutive year of comparable sales increases. This performance reflected Europe&#146;s strategic priorities to upgrade the customer and employee experience, enhance local relevance, and build brand transparency. Initiatives surrounding these priorities encompassed: leveraging our tiered menu featuring locally relevant selections of premium, classic core and everyday affordable menu offerings as well as dessert and limited-time food promotions; and reimaging nearly 900 restaurants including adding about 290 McCaf&#233;s&#151;an upscale area with coffeehouse-style ambiance inside an existing McDonald&#146;s restaurant. In addition, we addressed growing interest in portable snack offerings with platforms such as the Little Tasters in the U.K., launched breakfast in Germany and increased our convenience with extended hours. In order to support greater menu variety, we completed the roll-out of a new more efficient kitchen operating system in substantially all of our European restaurants. Finally, we enhanced customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonald&#146;s food and our sustainable business practices. \n\nIn APMEA, we continued to execute our four growth platforms of breakfast, convenience, core menu and value. Comparable sales rose 3.4% primarily due to the ongoing momentum of our business in Australia where multiple initiatives surrounding menu variety including the launch of the premium Angus burger, greater convenience and reimaging further strengthened our brand relevance. In addition, across the segment, we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants open 24-hours to over 4,600, expanding delivery service to more than 1,300 locations including about 300 in China, and enhancing drive-thru efficiency. We sustained the momentum of our breakfast business, currently in about 75% of our restaurants, by increasing customer awareness and visit frequency with the launch of premium roast coffee in key markets like Japan and China and promoting it through successful sampling programs. We continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability menus, especially our value lunch platforms, and highlighted classic menu favorites like the Quarter Pounder. \n\nOur customer-centered strategies seek to optimize price, product mix and promotion as a means to drive sales and profits. This approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to successfully execute our strategies in every area of the world contributed to improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin of 30.1% in 2009, an improvement of 2.7 percentage points over 2008. \n\nStrong global performance positively impacted cash from operations, which totaled $5.8 billion in 2009. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. About $2.0 billion of cash \n\n&#160; \n\nfrom operations was invested in our business primarily to open 868 restaurants (511 net, after 357 closings) and reimage about 1,850 existing locations. After these capital expenditures, we returned our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion consisting of $2.2 billion in dividends and $2.9 billion in share repurchases. This brought the total return to shareholders to $16.6 billion under our $15 billion to $17 billion target for 2007 through 2009. \n\nCash from operations continues to benefit from our evolution toward a more heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs, and is less capital-intensive. In addition, we believe locally-owned and operated restaurants help us maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage, making McDonald&#146;s not just a global brand but also a locally-relevant one. To that end, for 2008 and 2009 combined, we refranchised about 1,100 restaurants, increasing the percent of restaurants franchised worldwide to 81%. Refranchising impacts our consolidated financial statements as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Consolidated revenues are initially reduced because we collect rent and royalty as a percent of sales from a refranchised restaurant instead of 100% of its sales. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Company-operated margin dollars decline while franchised margin dollars increase. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Margin percentages are affected depending on the sales and cost structures of the restaurants refranchised. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Other operating (income) expense fluctuates as we recognize gains and/or losses resulting from sales of restaurants. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Combined operating margin percent improves. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Return on average assets increases primarily due to a decrease in average asset balances. \n\n##TABLE_END HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Comparable sales grew 3.8% and guest counts rose 1.4%, building on 2008 increases of 6.9% and 3.1%, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Growth in combined operating margin of 2.7 percentage points from 27.4% in 2008 to 30.1% in 2009. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Operating income increased 6% (10% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Net income per share was $4.11, an increase of 9% (13% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 10% to $0.55 for the fourth quarter&#150;bringing the current annual dividend rate to $2.20 per share. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; One-year ROIIC was 38.0% and three-year ROIIC was 42.9% for the period ended December 31, 2009. \n\n##TABLE_END OUTLOOK FOR 2010 \n\nWe will continue to drive success in 2010 and beyond by remaining focused on our &#147;better, not just bigger&#148; strategy and the key drivers of exceptional customer experiences&#151;People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. Our global System is energized by our ongoing momentum, strong competitive position and growth opportunities. \n\nWe intend to further differentiate our brand, increase customer visits and grow market share by pursuing initiatives in three key areas: service enhancement, restaurant reimaging and menu innovation. These efforts will include leveraging technology to make it easier for restaurant staff to quickly and accurately serve customers, accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and innovating at every tier of our menu to deliver great taste and value to customers. As we execute along these priorities and remain disciplined in operations and financial management, we expect to increase McDonald&#146;s brand relevance, widen our competitive lead and, in turn, grow sales, profits and returns. As we do so, we are confident we can meet or exceed the long-term constant currency financial targets previously discussed despite expectations for a continued challenging global economic environment in 2010. \n\nIn the U.S., our strategies include strengthening our core menu and value offerings, aggressively pursuing new growth opportunities in chicken, breakfast, beverages and snacking options, and elevating the brand experience. Our initiatives include highlighting the enduring appeal of core menu classics such as the Big Mac, emphasizing the value our menu offers all-day-long including the new breakfast value menu, and encouraging the trial of new products with the Mac Snack Wrap and&#151;by mid-year&#151;frapp&#233;s and smoothies. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology with a new point of sale system, enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity, and initiating a multi-year program to contemporize the interiors and exteriors of our restaurants through reimaging, completing about 500 in 2010. These efforts combined with the convenience of our locations, optimized drive-thru service, free wireless service and longer operating hours will further reinforce McDonald&#146;s position as an easy, enjoyable eating-out experience. \n\nOur plans for Europe are focused on building market share as we continue to execute along Europe&#146;s three key priorities. This includes upgrading our restaurant ambiance by reimaging approximately 1,000 restaurants, primarily in France and the U.K., as we make progress toward our goal to reimage more than 85% of our restaurants by the end of 2011. In addition, we expect to leverage technologies such as self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and drive-thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help speed service. We will further enhance our local relevance by complementing our tiered-menu with limited-time food events as well as new snack and dessert options. Finally, we will remain approachable and accessible as we continue to educate consumers about the quality and origin of our food and communicate our sustainable business practices. \n\nIn APMEA, we will execute initiatives that best support our goal to be customers&#146; first choice for eating out: convenience, core menu, branded affordability, improved operations and reimaging. Our convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24-hour or extended operating hours, expanding delivery service and building drive-thru traffic. At the same time, we will continue to elevate the role of our classic core and breakfast menus, complementing both with locally-relevant food news. We will maximize the impact of our everyday affordability platforms with mid-tier and value lunch programs and intensify our focus on operations to drive efficiencies. In addition, we will accelerate our reimaging efforts using a set of standard interior and exterior designs. Finally, given its size and long-term \n\n&#160; \n\npotential, we will continue to aggressively open new restaurants in China with a goal of opening about 600 restaurants over the next three years. \n\nWe will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and expect to refranchise restaurants when and where appropriate. As previously discussed, our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow, the amount of capital we invest and long-term returns. As a result, we expect free cash flow&#151;cash from operations less capital expenditures&#151;will continue to grow in the future. We remain committed to returning all this cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases over the long term. \n\nWe will remain disciplined financially as we seek to maximize the impact of all of our spending from selling, general &#38; administrative expenses to capital expenditures. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to elevate the McDonald&#146;s experience to drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. To that end, about half of the $2.4 billion of planned 2010 capital expenditures will be invested to reimage existing restaurants with the other half primarily used to build new locations. \n\nMcDonald&#146;s does not provide specific guidance on net income per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company&#146;s results: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly 2 percentage points to 2010 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 609 net traditional restaurants added in 2009. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual net income per share by about 3 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; With about 75% of McDonald&#146;s grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company&#146;s commodity costs. For the full year 2010, the total basket of goods cost is expected to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business, with more favorable comparisons in the first half of the year. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; The Company expects full-year 2010 selling, general &#38; administrative expenses to be relatively flat, in constant currencies, \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; although fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2010 such as the Vancouver Winter Olympics and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2010 to increase slightly compared with 2009. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; A significant part of the Company&#146;s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 45% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company&#146;s operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction compared with 2009, the Company&#146;s annual net income per share would change by about 17 to 19 cents. At current foreign currency rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to positively impact full year 2010 revenues and net income per share, with most of the benefit occurring in the first half of the year. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2010 to be approximately 29% to 31%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; McDonald&#146;s Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate) announced plans to close approximately 430 restaurants over the next 12-18 months in conjunction with the strategic review of the market&#146;s real estate portfolio. These actions are designed to enhance the customer experience, overall profitability and returns of the market. As a result of these closures, McDonald&#146;s Corporation expects to record after tax impairment charges totaling approximately $40 million to $50 million, primarily in the first half of the year. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; The Company expects capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants, including the reimaging of over 2,000 locations worldwide. The rest will primarily be used to open about 1,000 restaurants (975 traditional and 25 satellites). These restaurant numbers include new unit openings (about 350 restaurants) in affiliated and developmental licensed markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 325 restaurants (475 net traditional additions and 150 net satellite closings), which reflect the McDonald&#146;s Japan closings. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated Operating Results \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating results \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Dollars in millions, except per share data &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; Increase/ \n\n(decrease) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; Increase/ \n\n(decrease) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sales by Company-operated restaurants \n\n&#160; $ 15,459 &#160; &#160; (7 )% &#160; &#160; $ 16,561 &#160; &#160; &#151; % &#160; &#160; $ 16,611 &#160; Revenues from franchised restaurants \n\n&#160; &#160; 7,286 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,961 &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,176 &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 22,745 &#160; &#160; (3 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 23,522 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 22,787 &#160; Operating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Company-operated restaurant expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 12,651 &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 13,653 &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 13,742 &#160; Franchised restaurants&#151;occupancy expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,302 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,230 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,140 &#160; Selling, general &#38; administrative expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,234 &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,355 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,367 &#160; Impairment and other charges (credits), net \n\n&#160; &#160; (61 ) &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,670 &#160; Other operating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; &#160; (222 ) &#160; (35 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (165 ) &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (11 ) Total operating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 15,904 &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 17,079 &#160; &#160; (10 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,908 &#160; Operating income \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,841 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,443 &#160; &#160; 66 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,879 &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160; 473 &#160; &#160; (9 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 523 &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 410 &#160; Nonoperating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; &#160; (24 ) &#160; 69 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (78 ) &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (103 ) Gain on sale of investment \n\n&#160; &#160; (95 ) &#160; 41 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (160 ) &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,487 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,158 &#160; &#160; 72 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,572 &#160; Provision for income taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,936 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,845 &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,237 &#160; Income from continuing operations \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,551 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,313 &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,335 &#160; Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 60 &#160; Net income \n\n&#160; $ 4,551 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160;% &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 4,313 &#160; &#160; 80 % &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 2,395 &#160; Income per common share&#151;diluted \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Continuing operations \n\n&#160; $ 4.11 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160;% &#160; &#160; $ 3.76 &#160; &#160; 95 % &#160; &#160; $ 1.93 &#160; Discontinued operations \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.05 &#160; Net income \n\n&#160; $ 4.11 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160;% &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 3.76 &#160; &#160; 90 % &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1.98 &#160; Weighted-average common shares outstanding&#151;diluted \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,107.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,146.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,211.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END nm Not meaningful. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as &#147;Latam.&#148; As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. \n\nBased on approval by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was &#147;held for sale&#148; as of that date in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders&#146; equity. \n\nThe Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the \n\n&#147;held for sale&#148; criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonald&#146;s Consolidated balance sheet, totaling $97 million at December 31, 2009 and $142 million at December 31, 2008. The change in the balance was primarily a result of the resolution of certain of these liabilities as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company mitigates the currency impact to income of these foreign currency denominated liabilities through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements. \n\nThe buyers of the Company&#146;s operations in Latam entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonald&#146;s restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page, consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. These results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results. While the Company has converted certain \n\nother markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Dollars in millions, except per share data &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 (1) &#160; Latam \n\nTransaction (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2007 Excluding Latam Transaction &#160; 2009 \n\n% Inc \n\n&#160; 2008 Adjusted \n\n% Inc \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; $6,841 &#160; $6,443 &#160; $3,879 &#160; $(1,641 ) &#160; $5,520 &#160; 6 &#160; 17 Income from continuing operations \n\n&#160; 4,551 &#160; 4,313 &#160; 2,335 &#160; (1,579 ) &#160; 3,914 &#160; 6 &#160; 10 Income from discontinued operations \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 60 &#160; &#160; 60 &#160; &#160; Net income \n\n&#160; 4,551 &#160; 4,313 &#160; 2,395 &#160; (1,579 ) &#160; 3,974 &#160; 6 &#160; 9 Income per common share &#150; diluted \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Continuing operations (2,3) \n\n&#160; 4.11 &#160; 3.76 &#160; 1.93 &#160; (1.30 ) &#160; 3.23 &#160; 9 &#160; 16 Discontinued operations \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 0.05 &#160; &#160; 0.05 &#160; &#160; Net income (2,3) \n\n&#160; 4.11 &#160; 3.76 &#160; 1.98 &#160; (1.30 ) &#160; 3.28 &#160; 9 &#160; 15 ##TABLE_END nm Not meaningful. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The results for the full year 2007 included impairment and other charges of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007, and a tax benefit of $62 million. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) The following items impact the comparison of growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with 2008.

Results benefited by after tax income of $87 million or $0.08 per share primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Company&#146;s minority ownership interest in Redbox. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. \n\nIn 2008, net income and diluted net income per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million or $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Company&#146;s minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger. Results also benefited by $0.09 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. \n\nIn 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per \n\nshare resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company&#146;s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. \n\nThe Company repurchased 50.3 million shares of its stock for $2.9 billion in 2009 and 69.7 million shares for $4.0 billion in 2008, driving reductions of over 3% and 4% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. \n\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS \n\nWhile changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald&#146;s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. \n\nIn 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. \n\n&#160; \n\nImpact of foreign currency translation on reported results \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Reported amount &#160; &#160; &#160; Currency translation benefit/(cost) &#160; In millions, except per share data &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 22,745 &#160; $ 23,522 &#160; $ 22,787 &#160; &#160; $ (1,340 ) &#160; $ 441 &#160; &#160; $ 988 &#160; Company-operated margins \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,807 &#160; &#160; 2,908 &#160; &#160; 2,869 &#160; &#160; &#160; (178 ) &#160; &#160; 63 &#160; &#160; &#160; 129 &#160; Franchised margins \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,985 &#160; &#160; 5,731 &#160; &#160; 5,036 &#160; &#160; &#160; (176 ) &#160; &#160; 120 &#160; &#160; &#160; 179 &#160; Selling, general &#38; administrative expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,234 &#160; &#160; 2,355 &#160; &#160; 2,367 &#160; &#160; &#160; 75 &#160; &#160; &#160; (21 ) &#160; &#160; (73 ) Operating income \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,841 &#160; &#160; 6,443 &#160; &#160; 3,879 &#160; &#160; &#160; (273 ) &#160; &#160; 163 &#160; &#160; &#160; 230 &#160; Income from continuing operations \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,551 &#160; &#160; 4,313 &#160; &#160; 2,335 &#160; &#160; &#160; (164 ) &#160; &#160; 103 &#160; &#160; &#160; 138 &#160; Net income \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,551 &#160; &#160; 4,313 &#160; &#160; 2,395 &#160; &#160; &#160; (164 ) &#160; &#160; 103 &#160; &#160; &#160; 138 &#160; Income from continuing operations per common share&#151;diluted \n\n&#160; &#160; 4.11 &#160; &#160; 3.76 &#160; &#160; 1.93 &#160; &#160; &#160; (.15 ) &#160; &#160; .09 &#160; &#160; &#160; .12 &#160; Net income per common share&#151;diluted \n\n&#160; &#160; 4.11 &#160; &#160; 3.76 &#160; &#160; 1.98 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (.15 ) &#160; &#160; .09 &#160; &#160; &#160; .12 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nREVENUES \n\nThe Company&#146;s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. \n\nThe Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. For the full years 2008 and 2009 combined, the Company refranchised about 1,100 restaurants, primarily in its major markets. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalties based on a percent of sales. \n\nIn 2009, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the Company&#146;s major markets. As a result of the refranchising strategy, franchised restaurants represent 81%, 80% and 78% of Systemwide restaurants at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. \n\nIn 2008, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales, partly offset by the refranchising strategy and the impact of the Latam transaction. Upon completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. \n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; &#160; Increase/(decrease) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Increase/(decrease) \n\nexcluding currency \n\ntranslation \n\n&#160; Dollars in millions &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; Company-operated sales: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. \n\n&#160; $ 4,295 &#160; $ 4,636 &#160; $ 4,682 &#160; &#160; (7 )% &#160; (1 )% &#160; &#160; (7 )% &#160; (1 )% Europe \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,721 &#160; &#160; 7,424 &#160; &#160; 6,817 &#160; &#160; (9 ) &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; APMEA \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,714 &#160; &#160; 3,660 &#160; &#160; 3,134 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; Other Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 729 &#160; &#160; 841 &#160; &#160; 1,978 &#160; &#160; &#160; (13 ) &#160; (57 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; (58 ) Total \n\n&#160; $ 15,459 &#160; $ 16,561 &#160; $ 16,611 &#160; &#160; &#160; (7 )% &#160; &#151; &#160;% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160;% &#160; (2 )% Franchised revenues: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. \n\n&#160; $ 3,649 &#160; $ 3,442 &#160; $ 3,224 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160;% &#160; 7 &#160;% &#160; &#160; 6 &#160;% &#160; 7 &#160;% Europe \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,553 &#160; &#160; 2,499 &#160; &#160; 2,109 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; APMEA \n\n&#160; &#160; 623 &#160; &#160; 571 &#160; &#160; 465 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; Other Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 461 &#160; &#160; 449 &#160; &#160; 378 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 7,286 &#160; $ 6,961 &#160; $ 6,176 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160;% &#160; 13 &#160;% &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 &#160;% &#160; 10 &#160;% Total revenues: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. \n\n&#160; $ 7,944 &#160; $ 8,078 &#160; $ 7,906 &#160; &#160; (2 )% &#160; 2 &#160;% &#160; &#160; (2 )% &#160; 2 &#160;% Europe \n\n&#160; &#160; 9,274 &#160; &#160; 9,923 &#160; &#160; 8,926 &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; APMEA \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,337 &#160; &#160; 4,231 &#160; &#160; 3,599 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; Other Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,190 &#160; &#160; 1,290 &#160; &#160; 2,356 &#160; &#160; &#160; (8 ) &#160; (45 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; (2 ) &#160; (46 ) Total \n\n&#160; $ 22,745 &#160; $ 23,522 &#160; $ 22,787 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3 )% &#160; 3 &#160;% &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160;% &#160; 1 &#160;% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn the U.S., revenues in 2009 and 2008 were positively impacted by the ongoing appeal of our iconic core products and the success of new products, as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience. In addition, our market-leading breakfast business contributed to revenue growth in 2008. New products introduced in 2009 included McCaf&#233; premium coffees and the Angus Third Pounder, while new products introduced in 2008 included Southern Style Chicken products, Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea. The refranchising strategy negatively impacted revenue growth in both years. \n\nEurope&#146;s constant currency increases in revenues in 2009 and 2008 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia (which is entirely Company-operated) as well as expansion in Russia. In both years, these increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. \n\nIn APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2009 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Australia and most other Asian markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China. The 2008 increase was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Australia and China, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. \n\nIn Other Countries &#38; Corporate, Company-operated sales declined in 2008 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the Latam transaction in August 2007. Revenues in both years were negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy in Canada. \n\nThe following tables present Systemwide sales and comparable sales increases/(decreases): \n\nSystemwide sales increases/(decreases) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Excluding currency \n\ntranslation \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; U.S. \n\n&#160; 3 % &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; 5 % Europe \n\n&#160; (2 ) &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; APMEA \n\n&#160; 8 &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; Other Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; 2 % &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; 9 % ##TABLE_END Comparable sales increases \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; U.S. \n\n&#160; 2.6 % &#160; 4.0 % &#160; 4.5 % Europe \n\n&#160; 5.2 &#160; &#160; 8.5 &#160; &#160; 7.6 &#160; APMEA \n\n&#160; 3.4 &#160; &#160; 9.0 &#160; &#160; 10.6 &#160; Other Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; 5.5 &#160; &#160; 13.0 &#160; &#160; 10.8 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; 3.8 % &#160; 6.9 % &#160; 6.8 % ##TABLE_END RESTAURANT MARGINS \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Franchised margins \n\n##TABLE_END Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the Company&#146;s occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites.

The 2008 increase was primarily driven by positive comparable sales, partly offset by the refranchising strategy. \n\nEurope&#146;s franchised margin percent decreased in 2009 as positive comparable sales were offset by higher occupancy expenses, the refranchising strategy and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives. The 2008 increase was primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives. \n\nIn APMEA, the franchised margin percent increase in 2008 was primarily driven by positive comparable sales. \n\nIn Other Countries &#38; Corporate, the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 as a result of the 2007 Latam transaction. \n\nThe franchised margin percent in APMEA and, beginning in 2008, Other Countries &#38; Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Company-operated margins \n\n##TABLE_END Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants.

After the Latam transaction in August 2007, there are no Company-operated restaurants remaining in Latin America. Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 2009 and 2008.

The margin percent decreased in 2008 due to cost pressures including higher commodity and labor costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. \n\nEurope&#146;s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In 2009, local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs, primarily in Russia, and negatively impacted the Company-operated margin percent. \n\nIn APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2009 and 2008 increased due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent in 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs. \n\nIn Other Countries &#38; Corporate, the Company-operated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid-April through July 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants \n\n##TABLE_END We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. \n\nWe report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general &#38; administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. \n\nWe believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. \n\nThe following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as &#147;Store operating margin.&#148; The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as &#147;Brand/real estate margin.&#148; Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald&#146;s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. \n\nAs shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald&#146;s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy &#38; other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general &#38; administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Europe &#160; Dollars in millions &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; As reported \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Company-operated restaurants at year end \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,578 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,782 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,090 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,001 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,024 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,177 &#160; Sales by Company-operated restaurants \n\n&#160; $ 4,295 &#160; &#160; $ 4,636 &#160; &#160; $ 4,682 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 6,721 &#160; &#160; $ 7,424 &#160; &#160; $ 6,817 &#160; Company-operated margin \n\n&#160; $ 832 &#160; &#160; $ 856 &#160; &#160; $ 876 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1,240 &#160; &#160; $ 1,340 &#160; &#160; $ 1,205 &#160; Store operating margin \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Company-operated margin \n\n&#160; $ 832 &#160; &#160; $ 856 &#160; &#160; $ 876 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1,240 &#160; &#160; $ 1,340 &#160; &#160; $ 1,205 &#160; Plus: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Outside rent expense (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 65 &#160; &#160; &#160; 74 &#160; &#160; &#160; 82 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 222 &#160; &#160; &#160; 254 &#160; &#160; &#160; 248 &#160; Depreciation &#150; buildings &#38; leasehold improvements (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; &#160; 78 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 &#160; &#160; &#160; 110 &#160; &#160; &#160; 107 &#160; Less: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rent &#38; royalties (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; (634 ) &#160; &#160; (684 ) &#160; &#160; (691 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,306 ) &#160; &#160; (1,435 ) &#160; &#160; (1,294 ) Store operating margin \n\n&#160; $ 333 &#160; &#160; $ 316 &#160; &#160; $ 345 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 256 &#160; &#160; $ 269 &#160; &#160; $ 266 &#160; Brand/real estate margin \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rent &#38; royalties (2) \n\n&#160; $ 634 &#160; &#160; $ 684 &#160; &#160; $ 691 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1,306 &#160; &#160; $ 1,435 &#160; &#160; $ 1,294 &#160; Less: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Outside rent expense (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; (65 ) &#160; &#160; (74 ) &#160; &#160; (82 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; (222 ) &#160; &#160; (254 ) &#160; &#160; (248 ) Depreciation &#150; buildings &#38; leasehold improvements (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; (70 ) &#160; &#160; (70 ) &#160; &#160; (78 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (100 ) &#160; &#160; (110 ) &#160; &#160; (107 ) Brand/real estate margin \n\n&#160; $ 499 &#160; &#160; $ 540 &#160; &#160; $ 531 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 984 &#160; &#160; $ 1,071 &#160; &#160; $ 939 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy &#38; other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income &#150; rent payable by McDonald&#146;s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

The Company&#146;s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2009 and 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company-operated restaurants in connection with the refranchising strategy in the Company&#146;s major markets. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates \n\n##TABLE_END Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald&#146;s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets &#150; primarily Japan &#150; results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald&#146;s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2009 and 2008 reflected improved results from our Japanese affiliate. 2009 results also benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Asset dispositions and other expense \n\n##TABLE_END Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for store closings, uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous income and expenses.

This impact reflects an impairment charge of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007. In order to provide management&#146;s view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nResults for 2009 included $65 million of income in Other Countries &#38; Corporate primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. This benefit positively impacted the growth in total operating income by 1 percentage point. \n\nIn the U.S., 2009 and 2008 results increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. \n\nIn Europe, results for 2009 and 2008 were driven by strong performance in France, the U.K. and Russia. Positive results in Germany and most other markets also contributed to the operating income increase in 2008. \n\nIn APMEA, results for 2009 were driven primarily by strong results in Australia and expansion in China. Results for 2008 were driven by strong results in Australia and China, and positive performance in most other markets. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Combined operating margin \n\n##TABLE_END Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 30.1%, 27.4% and 17.0%, respectively. Impairment and other charges negatively impacted the 2007 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points. \n\nINTEREST EXPENSE \n\nInterest expense for 2009 decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates, and to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by higher average debt levels. Interest expense for 2008 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels, and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. \n\nNONOPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET \n\nNonoperating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START In millions &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Interest income \n\n&#160; $ (19 ) &#160; $ (85 ) &#160; $ (124 ) Translation and hedging activity \n\n&#160; &#160; (32 ) &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; Other expense \n\n&#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ (24 ) &#160; $ (78 ) &#160; $ (103 ) ##TABLE_END Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on short- term cash investments. Translation and hedging activity primarily \n\nrelates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt issuance costs and other nonoperating income and expenses. \n\nInterest income decreased for 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates, while 2008 decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances. \n\nGAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT \n\nIn 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $140 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax&#150;$59 million or $0.05 per share). \n\nIn 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million (after tax&#150;$109 million or $0.09 per share). \n\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES \n\nIn 2009, 2008 and 2007, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.8%, 30.0% and 34.6%, respectively. \n\nIn 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. \n\nIn 2007, the effective income tax rate was impacted by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to the Latam impairment charge of $1,641 million. This benefit was minimal due to the Company&#146;s inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction in 2007. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. \n\n##TABLE_END Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in both 2009 and 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nSubstantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. \n\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS \n\nOver the last several years, the Company has continued to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald&#146;s restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result of the disposal, Boston Market&#146;s results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. In connection with the sale, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Market&#146;s net loss for 2007 was $9 million. \n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Sabbatical leave \n\n##TABLE_END In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on accounting for sabbatical leave, codified in the Compensation &#150; General Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Under this guidance, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings is not significant. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Income tax uncertainties \n\n##TABLE_END In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, codified primarily in the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance also covers derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The guidance requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long-term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of the guidance, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long-term and included in other long-term liabilities. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Fair value measurements \n\n##TABLE_END In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements, codified primarily in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, \n\nas issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Subsequent events \n\n##TABLE_END In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events, codified in the Subsequent Events Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance also indicates the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, as well as the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in the second quarter 2009. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, besides the additional disclosure. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Variable interest entities and consolidation \n\n##TABLE_END In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a company&#146;s involvement with a variable interest entity. This guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2010, and we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nCash Flows \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\nCash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in both years. In 2009, cash provided by operations decreased $166 million or 3% compared with 2008 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments, higher noncash income items and the receipt of $143 million in 2008 related to the completion of an IRS examination. In 2008, cash provided by operations increased $1.0 billion or 21% compared with 2007 primarily due to increased operating results and changes in working capital, partly due to lower income tax payments and the receipt of $143 million related to the IRS examination. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash used for investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, an increase of $31 million compared with 2008. This reflects lower proceeds from sales of investments, restaurant businesses and property, offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily in the U.S. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of $475 million compared with 2007. Investing activities in 2008 reflected lower proceeds from sales of investments and higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from the sales of restaurant businesses and property and lower expenditures on purchases of restaurant businesses. \n\nCash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion in 2009, an increase of $307 million compared with 2008, primarily due to lower net debt issuances, an increase in the common stock dividend and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.1 billion in 2008, an increase of $118 million compared with 2007, which reflected lower proceeds from stock option exercises, mostly offset by higher net debt issuances. \n\nAs a result of the above activity, the Company&#146;s cash and equivalents balance decreased $267 million in 2009 to $1.8 billion, compared with an increase of $82 million in 2008. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. \n\nRESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n\nIn 2009, the Company opened 824 traditional restaurants and 44 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 215 traditional restaurants and 142 satellite restaurants. In 2008, the Company opened 918 traditional restaurants and 77 satellite restaurants and closed 209 traditional restaurants and 196 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure. \n\nSystemwide restaurants at year end (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 U.S. \n\n&#160; 13,980 &#160; 13,918 &#160; 13,862 Europe \n\n&#160; 6,785 &#160; 6,628 &#160; 6,480 APMEA \n\n&#160; 8,488 &#160; 8,255 &#160; 7,938 Other Countries &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; 3,225 &#160; 3,166 &#160; 3,097 Total \n\n&#160; 32,478 &#160; 31,967 &#160; 31,377 ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Includes satellite units at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 as follows: U.S.&#150; 1,155, 1,169, 1,233; Europe&#150;241, 226, 214; APMEA (primarily Japan)&#150;1,263, 1,379, 1,454; Other Countries &#38; Corporate&#150;464, 447, 439. ##TABLE_END Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2009. Franchisees operated 81% of the restaurants at year-end 2009. \n\nCapital expenditures decreased $184 million or 9% in 2009 primarily due to fewer restaurant openings, lower reinvestment in existing restaurants in the U.S. and the impact of foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures increased $189 million or 10% in 2008 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants in Europe and APMEA. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Company&#146;s commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, \n\nincluding reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world and, to a lesser extent in 2009, the Combined Beverage Business in the U.S. \n\nCapital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented 70% to 75% of the total in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. \n\nCapital expenditures \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START In millions &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 New restaurants \n\n&#160; $ 809 &#160; $ 897 &#160; $ 687 Existing restaurants \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,070 &#160; &#160; 1,152 &#160; &#160; 1,158 Other (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 73 &#160; &#160; 87 &#160; &#160; 102 Total capital expenditures \n\n&#160; $ 1,952 &#160; $ 2,136 &#160; $ 1,947 Total assets \n\n&#160; $ 30,225 &#160; $ 28,462 &#160; $ 29,392 ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office related expenditures. ##TABLE_END New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald&#146;s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.7 million in 2009. \n\nThe Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2009 and 2008. \n\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS \n\nIn 2009, the Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, bringing the three-year total to $16.6 billion under the Company&#146;s $15 billion to $17 billion cash returned to shareholders target for 2007 through 2009. \n\nShares repurchased and dividends \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 Number of shares repurchased \n\n&#160; &#160; 50.3 &#160; &#160; 69.7 &#160; &#160; 77.1 Shares outstanding at year end \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,077 &#160; &#160; 1,115 &#160; &#160; 1,165 Dividends declared per share \n\n&#160; $ 2.05 &#160; $ 1.625 &#160; $ 1.50 Dollar amount of shares repurchased \n\n&#160; $ 2,854 &#160; $ 3,981 &#160; $ 3,949 Dividends paid \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,235 &#160; &#160; 1,823 &#160; &#160; 1,766 Total returned to shareholders \n\n&#160; $ 5,089 &#160; $ 5,804 &#160; $ 5,715 ##TABLE_END In September 2007, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In September 2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors terminated the then-existing share repurchase program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company&#146;s \n\n&#160; \n\noutstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2009, approximately 50 million shares were repurchased for $2.9 billion, of which 8 million shares or $0.5 billion were purchased under the new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 3% compared with 2008, net of stock option exercises. \n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 34 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2009 full year dividend of $2.05 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.50 per share, with an increase to $0.55 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.20 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Company&#146;s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\nFinancial Position and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS \n\nTotal assets increased $1.8 billion or 6% in 2009. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $677 million in 2009. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2009. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion in 2009 and represented over 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $476 million primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation, the impact of refranchising and asset retirements related to reimaging. \n\nOperating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. \n\nReturns on assets and equity \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Return on average assets \n\n&#160; 23.4 % &#160; 21.8 % &#160; 13.2 % Return on average common equity \n\n&#160; 34.0 &#160; &#160; 30.6 &#160; &#160; 15.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END In 2009, 2008 and 2007, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong global operating results. During 2010, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and invest new capital in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. \n\nIn 2009, impairment and other charges (credits), net benefited return on average assets and return on average common equity by 0.2 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively. \n\nIn 2007, impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points. Impairment and other charges (credits), net partly offset by the 2007 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, reduced return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points in 2007. \n\nOperating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 2.0 percentage points, 1.9 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. \n\nFINANCING AND MARKET RISK \n\nThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2009 totaled $10.6 billion, compared with $10.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The net increase in 2009 was primarily due to net issuances of $219 million and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $128 million. \n\nDebt highlights (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Fixed-rate debt as a percent of total debt (2,3) \n\n&#160; 68 % &#160; 72 % &#160; 58 % Weighted-average annual interest rate of total debt (3) \n\n&#160; 4.5 &#160; &#160; 5.0 &#160; &#160; 4.7 &#160; Foreign currency-denominated debt as a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; 43 &#160; &#160; 45 &#160; &#160; 66 &#160; Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total shareholders&#146; equity) (2) \n\n&#160; 43 &#160; &#160; 43 &#160; &#160; 38 &#160; Cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; 55 &#160; &#160; 59 &#160; &#160; 53 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) Based on debt obligations before the effect of fair value hedging adjustments. This effect is excluded as these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) Includes the effect of interest rate exchange agreements. ##TABLE_END Fitch, Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and Moody&#146;s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company&#146;s commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A3, respectively. The Company&#146;s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Company&#146;s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $6 billion and $12 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 30% of Company-operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Company&#146;s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent \n\n&#160; \n\npayments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. \n\nCertain of the Company&#146;s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company&#146;s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#146;s business. Under existing authorization from the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2009, the Company has $5 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Euro Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and Euromarket (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2010 is approximately $607 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2010, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. The Company also has $599 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end. \n\nHistorically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. Although there are continued constraints in the overall financial markets on available credit, the Company&#146;s ability to raise funding in the long-term and short-term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected. In January 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 5.0%, and $350 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated bonds at a coupon rate of 5.7%. In June 2009, the Company issued 300 million Euro ($423 million) of 7-year notes at a coupon rate of 4.25%. \n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. \n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders&#146; equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, where practical, the Company&#146;s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial \n\ninstruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. \n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2009, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company&#146;s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. \n\nThe Company&#146;s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company&#146;s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: \n\nForeign currency net asset exposures \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 Euro \n\n&#160; $ 5,151 &#160; $ 4,551 Australian Dollars \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,460 &#160; &#160; 1,023 Canadian Dollars \n\n&#160; &#160; 981 &#160; &#160; 795 British Pounds Sterling \n\n&#160; &#160; 679 &#160; &#160; 785 Russian Ruble \n\n&#160; &#160; 501 &#160; &#160; 407 ##TABLE_END The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company&#146;s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company&#146;s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company&#146;s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2009 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2009 levels would materially affect the Company&#146;s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company&#146;s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company&#146;s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2009. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Contractual cash outflows &#160; &#160; &#160; Contractual cash inflows In millions &#160; Operating leases &#160; Debt obligations (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Minimum rent under franchise arrangements 2010 \n\n&#160; $ 1,119 &#160; $ 18 &#160; &#160; $ 2,294 2011 \n\n&#160; 1,047 &#160; 613 &#160; &#160; 2,220 2012 \n\n&#160; 963 &#160; 2,188 &#160; &#160; 2,156 2013 \n\n&#160; 885 &#160; 658 &#160; &#160; 2,078 2014 \n\n&#160; 806 &#160; 460 &#160; &#160; 1,987 Thereafter \n\n&#160; 5,897 &#160; 6,562 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15,278 Total \n\n&#160; $10,717 &#160; $10,499 &#160; &#160; &#160; $26,013 ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $1.2 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in 2012. Debt obligations do not include $80 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $196 million of accrued interest. ##TABLE_END The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Company&#146;s qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $397 million at December 31, 2009 and are reflected on McDonald&#146;s Consolidated balance sheet as follows: other long-term liabilities&#150;$362 million, and accrued payroll and other liabilities&#150;$35 million. Total liabilities for international retirement plans at December 31, 2009 were $184 million and were primarily reflected in other long-term liabilities. The Company has also recorded $492 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, of which $286 million is included in other long-term liabilities and $206 million is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. \n\nOther Matters \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nManagement&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. \n\nThe Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Property and equipment \n\n##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management&#146;s \n\nestimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Share-based compensation \n\n##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. \n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of the Company&#146;s stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Long-lived assets impairment review \n\n##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company&#146;s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company&#146;s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company&#146;s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. \n\nWhen the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are &#147;held for sale&#148; in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and, if required, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors have approved and committed to a \n\n&#160; \n\nplan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets&#146; net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146; equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. \n\nAn alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the 2007 Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components&#150;the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. \n\nThe Company bases its accounting policy on management&#146;s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market-based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Litigation accruals \n\n##TABLE_END From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#149; &#160; Income taxes \n\n##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. \n\nIn addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The \n\nCompany records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Company&#146;s 2005-2006 U.S. tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Company&#146;s 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns. The Company&#146;s 2007-2008 U.S. tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2010. \n\nDeferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $9.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management&#146;s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. \n\nEFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES&#151;INFLATION \n\nThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. \n\nRECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL \n\nReturn on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company&#146;s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. \n\nThe denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle, Latam, Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter&#146;s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2008 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2009 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows (dollars in millions) : \n\nOne-year ROIIC Calculation \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160;
