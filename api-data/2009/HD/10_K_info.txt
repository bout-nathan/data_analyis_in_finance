Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data \n\nFor fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 (&#147;fiscal 2009&#148;), we reported Net Earnings of $2.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.57 compared to Net Earnings of $2.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.34 for fiscal year ended February 1, 2009 (&#147;fiscal 2008&#148;). \n\nThe results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 reflect the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008. These strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline, business rationalization charges related to the exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the &#147;Exited Businesses&#148;) and charges related to the restructuring of support functions (collectively, the &#147;Rationalization Charges&#148;). These actions resulted in pretax Rationalization Charges of $146 million and $951 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\nOur fiscal 2009 and 2008 results included a pretax charge of $163 million in each year to write-down our investment in HD Supply, Inc. Additionally, fiscal 2009 included earnings of $41 million from discontinued operations, net of tax, compared to a loss of $52 million from discontinued operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. \n\nWe reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.6 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.55 for fiscal 2009 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.37 for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-downs of our investment in HD Supply, Earnings from Continuing Operations were $2.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.66 for fiscal 2009 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $3.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.78 for fiscal 2008. \n\nNet Sales decreased 7.2% to $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009 from $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The slowdown in the global economy and weakness in the U.S. residential construction, housing and home improvement markets negatively impacted our Net Sales for fiscal 2009. Our comparable store sales declined 6.6% in fiscal 2009 driven by a 6.3% decline in our comparable store average ticket to $51.65, as well as a 0.3% decline in comparable store customer transactions. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores declined 6.2% in fiscal 2009. \n\nIn fiscal 2009, we continued to focus on our core retail business, investing in our associates and stores and improving our customer service. The roll-out of our Customers FIRST training to all store associates and support staff in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 has brought simplification and focus across the business, and we are seeing the benefit of this in improved customer service ratings for fiscal 2009. \n\nWe also made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the U.S. that helped us to better manage markdown and clearance activity and to better control inventory. At the end of fiscal 2009, our inventory had decreased by $485 million, or 4.5%, from fiscal 2008. Additionally, our average inventory per store decreased by 3.3% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to last year. We continued our supply chain transformation to improve product availability. At the end of fiscal 2009, we had 12 Rapid Deployment Centers (&#147;RDCs&#148;) operating that serve approximately 65% of our U.S. stores. We remain committed to our overall RDC roll-out strategy, supporting our goal of increasing our central distribution penetration. Our supply chain transformation also includes restructuring our stocking distribution centers. \n\nWe opened 13 new stores in fiscal 2009, closed two stores in China and closed 41 stores related to our Exited Businesses, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2009 to 2,244. As of the end of fiscal 2009, a total of 268 stores, or approximately 12%, were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 262 stores, or approximately 12%, as of fiscal 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe generated $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009. We used a portion of this cash flow to repay $1.8 billion of Long-Term Debt, pay $1.5 billion of dividends, fund $966 million in capital expenditures and fund $213 million of share repurchases. \n\nAt the end of fiscal 2009, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 44.7% compared to 54.4% at the end of fiscal 2008. Our return on invested capital for continuing operations (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 10.7% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2008. Excluding Rationalization Charges, our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 11.1% for fiscal 2009 compared to 11.4% for fiscal 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; % of Net Sales &#160; &#160; % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; &#160; 2009 vs. 2008 &#160; &#160; 2008 vs. 2007 &#160; NET SALES \n\n&#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; (7.2 )% &#160; (7.8 )% Gross Profit \n\n&#160; &#160; 33.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33.6 &#160; &#160; (6.6 ) &#160; (7.7 ) Operating Expenses: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Selling, General and Administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 24.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22.1 &#160; &#160; (10.9 ) &#160; 4.7 &#160; Depreciation and Amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.2 &#160; &#160; &#160;(4.4 ) &#160; 4.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Operating Expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 26.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24.3 &#160; &#160; &#160;(10.3 ) &#160; 4.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; OPERATING INCOME \n\n&#160; &#160; 7.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9.4 &#160; &#160; 10.2 &#160; &#160; (39.8 ) Interest and Other (Income) Expense: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest and Investment Income \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (0.1 ) &#160; 0.0 &#160; &#160; (75.7 ) Interest Expense \n\n&#160; &#160; 1.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.9 &#160; &#160; 8.3 &#160; &#160; (10.3 ) Other \n\n&#160; &#160; 0.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest and Other, net \n\n&#160; &#160; 1.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.8 &#160; &#160; 6.8 &#160; &#160; 23.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES \n\n&#160; &#160; 6.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.6 &#160; &#160; 10.9 &#160; &#160; (45.8 ) Provision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.1 &#160; &#160; 6.6 &#160; &#160; &#160;(47.0 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; &#160; 4.0 % &#160; &#160; 3.2 % &#160; &#160; 5.4 % &#160; 13.3 % &#160; &#160;(45.1 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; SELECTED SALES DATA \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,274 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,272 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,336 &#160; &#160; 0.2 % &#160; (4.8 )% Average Ticket (2) \n\n&#160; $ 51.76 &#160; &#160; $ 55.61 &#160; &#160; $ 57.48 &#160; &#160; (6.9 ) &#160; (3.3 ) Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands) (2) \n\n&#160; $ 563 &#160; &#160; $ 601 &#160; &#160; $ 658 &#160; &#160; (6.3 ) &#160; (8.7 ) Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot (2) \n\n&#160; $ 278.97 &#160; &#160; $ 298.19 &#160; &#160; $ 331.86 &#160; &#160; (6.4 ) &#160; (10.1 ) Comparable Store Sales Decrease (%) (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; (6.6 )% &#160; &#160; (8.7 )% &#160; &#160; (6.7 )% &#160; N/A &#160; &#160; N/A &#160; ##TABLE_END Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 refer to the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, February 1, 2009 and February 3, 2008, respectively.

Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365 th day of operation. Comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for Net Sales or Net Earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nResults of Operations \n\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. \n\nFiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet Sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 7.2% to $66.2 billion from $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales as well as the net impact of fewer open stores in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. Total comparable store sales decreased 6.6% for fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 8.7% for fiscal 2008. \n\nThere were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction, housing and home improvement markets continued to be soft, and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment. We saw relative strength in our Building Materials, Flooring, Paint, Plumbing and Garden/Seasonal product categories as comparable store sales in these areas were above the Company average for fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Hardware, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork product categories were below the Company average for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we also saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. Fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total Company sales by approximately $565 million for fiscal 2009 compared to last year. \n\nWe believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. We estimate our share of the U.S. home improvement market is approximately 21%. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross Profit decreased 6.6% to $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009 from $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 33.7% for fiscal 2008, an increase of 22 basis points. Through our focused bay portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin. Additionally, gross margin expansion for fiscal 2009 was driven by lower markdowns as compared to last year. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses (&#147;SG&#38;A&#148;) decreased 10.9% to $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009 from $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#38;A was 24.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 25.0% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 23.7% for fiscal 2008. Our SG&#38;A results for fiscal 2009 reflect the impact of a negative comparable store sales environment, offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control. For fiscal 2009, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 25.1% compared to 28.1% for fiscal 2008. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization decreased 4.4% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009 from $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.6% for fiscal 2009 and 2.5% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating Income increased 10.2% to $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009 from $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.3% for fiscal 2009 compared to 6.1% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the \n\n&#160; \n\nRationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 7.4% for fiscal 2008. \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nIn fiscal 2009, we recognized $821 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $769 million in fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.2% for fiscal 2009 compared to 1.1% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 34.2% for fiscal 2009 from 35.6% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and realignment of our foreign corporate structure. These benefits positively impacted Diluted Earnings per Share by approximately $0.06 for fiscal 2009. \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.55 for fiscal 2009 and $1.37 for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-downs of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2009 were $1.66 compared to $1.78 for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 6.7%. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nOn August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share in fiscal 2008, in each case for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. \n\nNon-GAAP Measures \n\nTo provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance for fiscal 2009 and 2008, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect adjustments for the Rationalization Charges as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Net Sales from Exited Businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing, and the charges to write-down our investment in HD Supply as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions, except per share data): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 &#160; &#160; &#160; As Reported &#160; Adjustments &#160; &#160; Non-GAAP Measures &#160; % of Net Sales &#160; Net Sales \n\n&#160; $ 66,176 &#160; $ 221 &#160; &#160; $ 65,955 &#160; 100.0 % Cost of Sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 43,764 &#160; &#160; 193 &#160; &#160; &#160; 43,571 &#160; 66.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross Profit \n\n&#160; &#160; 22,412 &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22,384 &#160; 33.9 &#160; Operating Expenses: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Selling, General and Administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 15,902 &#160; &#160; 170 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15,732 &#160; 23.9 &#160; Depreciation and Amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,707 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,703 &#160; 2.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Operating Expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 17,609 &#160; &#160; 174 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17,435 &#160; 26.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,803 &#160; &#160; (146 ) &#160; &#160; 4,949 &#160; 7.5 &#160; Interest and Other, net \n\n&#160; &#160; 821 &#160; &#160; 163 &#160; &#160; &#160; 658 &#160; 1.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,982 &#160; &#160; (309 ) &#160; &#160; 4,291 &#160; 6.5 &#160; Provision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,362 &#160; &#160; (118 ) &#160; &#160; 1,480 &#160; 2.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earnings from Continuing Operations \n\n&#160; $ 2,620 &#160; $ (191 ) &#160; $ 2,811 &#160; 4.3 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\n&#160; $ 1.55 &#160; $ (0.11 ) &#160; $ 1.66 &#160; N/A &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2009 &#160; &#160; &#160; As Reported &#160; Adjustments &#160; &#160; Non-GAAP Measures &#160; % of Net Sales &#160; Net Sales \n\n&#160; $ 71,288 &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ 71,288 &#160; 100.0 % Cost of Sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 47,298 &#160; &#160; 30 &#160; &#160; &#160; 47,268 &#160; 66.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross Profit \n\n&#160; &#160; 23,990 &#160; &#160; (30 ) &#160; &#160; 24,020 &#160; 33.7 &#160; Operating Expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Selling, General and Administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 17,846 &#160; &#160; 918 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16,928 &#160; 23.7 &#160; Depreciation and Amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,785 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,782 &#160; 2.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Operating Expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 19,631 &#160; &#160; 921 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,710 &#160; 26.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,359 &#160; &#160; (951 ) &#160; &#160; 5,310 &#160; 7.4 &#160; Interest and Other, net \n\n&#160; &#160; 769 &#160; &#160; 163 &#160; &#160; &#160; 606 &#160; 0.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,590 &#160; &#160; (1,114 ) &#160; &#160; 4,704 &#160; 6.6 &#160; Provision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,278 &#160; &#160; (430 ) &#160; &#160; 1,708 &#160; 2.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earnings from Continuing Operations \n\n&#160; $ 2,312 &#160; $ (684 ) &#160; $ 2,996 &#160; 4.2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\n&#160; $ 1.37 &#160; $ (0.41 ) &#160; $ 1.78 &#160; N/A &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2008 (&#147;fiscal 2007&#148;) \n\nNet Sales \n\nFiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2007. Net Sales for fiscal 2008 decreased 7.8% to $71.3 billion from $77.3 billion for fiscal 2007. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales and $1.1 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007, partially offset by Net Sales of $1.8 billion from new stores in fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales decreased 8.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to a decrease of 6.7% for fiscal 2007. \n\nThere were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to higher unemployment and an across-the-board tightening of consumer credit availability. We saw relative strength in Building Materials, Plumbing, Garden/Seasonal and Hardware as comparable store sales in these areas were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales for Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork were below the Company average for fiscal 2008. Softness in our big ticket categories negatively impacted average ticket, which decreased 3.3% to $55.61 for fiscal 2008. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 5% of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2008, which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1%. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross Profit decreased 7.7% to $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008 from $26.0 billion for fiscal 2007. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to 33.6% for fiscal 2007, an increase of four basis points. This gross margin expansion included $30 million in markdowns taken in connection with our Rationalization Charges. Excluding these markdowns, our Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales increased eight basis points for fiscal 2008, reflecting our focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nSG&#38;A increased 4.7% to $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008 from $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#38;A was 25.0% for fiscal 2008 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2008 was 23.7%, an increase of approximately 170 basis points over the prior year. The increase in SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of expense deleverage in the negative comparable store sales environment, as well as an increase of approximately 70 basis points due to a higher cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program. For fiscal 2008, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 28.1% compared to 29.4% for fiscal 2007. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization increased 4.9% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2007. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.5% for fiscal 2008 and 2.2% for fiscal 2007. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to sales deleverage and the depreciation of our investments in shorter lived assets such as store resets and technology. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating Income decreased 39.8% to $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008 from $7.2 billion for fiscal 2007. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 6.1% for fiscal 2008 compared to 9.4% for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.4% for fiscal 2008. \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nIn fiscal 2008, we recognized $769 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $622 million in fiscal 2007. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.1% for fiscal 2008 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding this charge, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2008. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 35.6% for fiscal 2008 from 36.4% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects lower state and foreign effective tax rates. \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.37 for fiscal 2008 and $2.27 for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2008 were $1.78, a decrease of 21.6% from fiscal 2007. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007. \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were favorably impacted by the repurchase of shares of our common stock. We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $70 million in fiscal 2008 and 293 million shares for $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nOn August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 consist of a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 consist of the results of operations for HD Supply through August 30, 2007 and a $4 million loss on the sale of HD Supply. Net Sales from discontinued operations were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2007 and Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were $185 million for fiscal 2007. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2009, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $5.1 billion compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2008. This change was a result of lower earnings excluding noncash impairment charges and reduced cash flows from working capital items. \n\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2009 was $755 million compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of $881 million less in Capital Expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. \n\nIn fiscal 2009, we spent $966 million on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 26% for merchandising and operations, 19% for maintenance, 19% for core technology, 15% for new stores and 21% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2009, we added 13 new stores. \n\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2009 was $3.5 billion compared with $3.7 billion for fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily due to repayments in fiscal 2008 of $1.7 billion of short-term commercial paper and $282 million of structured financing debt compared to $1.8 billion in Repayments of Long-Term Debt in fiscal 2009. \n\nWe repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock for $213 million in fiscal 2009 and 2.4 million shares for $70 million in fiscal 2008. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 753.6 million shares of our common stock for a total of $27.5 billion. As of January 31, 2010, $12.5 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. \n\nWe have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. As \n\n&#160; \n\nof January 31, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in December 2010 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of January 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. In August 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the potential future issuance of debt securities, replacing a shelf registration statement that had expired. \n\nWe use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2009, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 44.7% compared to 54.4% at the end of fiscal 2008. \n\nAs of January 31, 2010, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan (&#147;guaranteed loan&#148;) in connection with the sale of HD Supply. The fair value of the guarantee, which was determined to be approximately $16 million, is recorded as a liability and included in Other Long-Term Liabilities. We are responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, we amended the expiration date and extended it to April 1, 2014. \n\nAs of January 31, 2010, we had $1.4 billion in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. \n\nAt January 31, 2010, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $12 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements. \n\nIn November 2009, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2010. At January 31, 2010, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $3 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement. \n\nDuring fiscal 2008 and 2007, we entered into interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with notional amounts of $3.0 billion, that swapped fixed rate interest on our $3.0 billion 5.40% Senior Notes for variable rate interest equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 149 basis points. In fiscal 2008, we received $56 million to settle these swaps, which is being amortized to reduce net Interest Expense over the remaining term of the debt. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 31, 2010 (amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations \n\n&#160; Total &#160; 2010 &#160; 2011-2012 &#160; 2013-2014 &#160; Thereafter Total Debt (1) \n\n&#160; $ 15,495 &#160; $ 1,476 &#160; $ 1,824 &#160; $ 2,017 &#160; $ 10,178 Capital Lease Obligations (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,242 &#160; &#160; 90 &#160; &#160; 180 &#160; &#160; 177 &#160; &#160; 795 Operating Leases \n\n&#160; &#160; 8,536 &#160; &#160; 802 &#160; &#160; 1,357 &#160; &#160; 1,119 &#160; &#160; 5,258 Purchase Obligations (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,073 &#160; &#160; 1,494 &#160; &#160; 1,779 &#160; &#160; 1,769 &#160; &#160; 31 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4) \n\n&#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 30,369 &#160; $ 3,885 &#160; $ 5,140 &#160; $ 5,082 &#160; $ 16,262 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $408 million. Includes $6.2 billion of interest payments. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) Includes $834 million of imputed interest. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (4) Excludes $636 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. ##TABLE_END Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating debt portfolio. At January 31, 2010, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 87% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 13% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations. \n\nAs of January 31, 2010 we had, net of discounts, $9.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 31, 2010, was approximately $9.5 billion. \n\nAlthough we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nImpact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices \n\nWe have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. \n\nMerchandise Inventories \n\nOur Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 82% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2009 or 2008. \n\nIndependent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, &#147;swell&#148;) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. \n\nSelf-Insurance \n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers&#146; compensation and medical claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. \n\nVendor Allowances \n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors&#146; products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate \n\n&#160; \n\nof vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. \n\nVolume rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors&#146; products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SG&#38;A. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, management&#146;s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. \n\nThe assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes management&#146;s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&#38;A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SG&#38;A the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. \n\nWe make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. \n\nAs part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no asset impairment and $84 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 compared to $580 million of asset impairments and $252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2008. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the Rationalization Charges. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on results of operations. We also recorded impairments on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. \n\nWe make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point \n\n&#160; \n\nincrease in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. \n\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. We recorded no impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets for fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued &#147;The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles&#148; (&#147;FASB ASC 105-10&#148;), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Codification&#148;) as the sole source for authoritative U.S. GAAP and supersedes all accounting standards in U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. FASB ASC 105-10 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of operations. In accordance with the Codification, references to previously issued accounting standards have been replaced by FASB ASC references. \n\nIn June 2009, the FASB issued &#147;Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)&#148; (&#147;FASB ASC 810-10&#148;), which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity&#146;s purpose and design and a company&#146;s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic performance. FASB ASC 810-10 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept. FASB ASC 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a company&#146;s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn June 2008, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "}
