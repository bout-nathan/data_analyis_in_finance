The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. \n\nThe effective tax rate increased by 0.1 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 due principally to a higher overall state effective tax rate and a decreased impact from the settlement of audits, partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign tax rates. \n\nIn 2010, the effective tax could change based upon the Company&#146;s operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities, several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters, the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved. \n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2009 \n\n&#160; 2008 \n\n&#160; 2007 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nNet income attributable to Honeywell \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,153 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,792 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,444 \n\n&#160; Earnings per share of common stock&#151;assuming dilution \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2.85 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3.76 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3.16 \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END The decrease of $0.91 in earnings per share of common stock&#151;assuming dilution in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily relates to a decrease in segment profit in each of our business segments, decreased Other (Income) Expense, as discussed above, and an increase in the number of shares outstanding partially offset by lower repositioning charges. \n\nThe increase of $0.60 in earnings per share of common stock&#151;assuming dilution in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily relates to (i) the gain on sale of the Consumables Solutions business, (ii) lower pension and other post retirement expense, (iii) an increase in segment profit (most significantly in Automation and Control Solutions and Aerospace, partially offset by a decline in Transportation Systems segment profit) and (iv) a reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to share repurchases, partially offset by increased repositioning costs. \n\nFor further discussion of segment results, see &#147;Review of Business Segments&#148;. \n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW \n\nThis Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2010 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segment&#146;s results for the three years ended December 31, 2009.

Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009. The decrease is driven by lower sales to our OE customers, consistent with production rates and platform mix, and the impact of divesting our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly due to the absence of a strike at a major OEM in the fourth quarter of 2008. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional aftermarket sales decreased by 16 percent in 2009 primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower maintenance activity driven by the impact of higher parked aircraft part utilization, customer inventory reduction initiatives and decreased flying hours of approximately 2 percent, including a 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter. While we expect global flying hours to increase slightly in 2010, we expect aftermarket sales to remain soft in the first half of 2010 due to the continuation of inventory destocking and the rising number of parked aircraft. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 51 percent in 2009 due to the decrease in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation aftermarket sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower revenue associated with maintenance service agreements, consistent with the decrease in business jet utilization. We started to see an increase in business jet utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009 and expect stabilization at these levels. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Defense and space sales were essentially unchanged in 2009, primarily due to higher sales of logistics services and original equipment for military platforms in the first nine months of 2009 offset by program completions. Delays in defense and space programs could impact the timing of sales in this end- market over the course of 2010. \n\n##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, \n\nbenefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices. \n\n2008 compared with 2007 \n\nAerospace sales increased by 3 percent in 2008. Details regarding the net increase in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 6 percent in 2008. The decrease was driven by the sale of our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by increased deliveries to our air transport customers, notwithstanding a decrease in total aircraft production rates at major OEM&#146;s mainly due to a strike at a major OEM, which was settled in the fourth quarter of 2008. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent in 2008 primarily due to increased volume, the price of spare parts and aftermarket growth driven by flight hour growth. The growth rate in global flying hours slowed to 3 percent in 2008, including a 2 percent decline in the fourth quarter. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 5 percent in 2008 due to continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries, improved pricing and continued additions to the fractional ownership and charter fleets. In 2008, sales to this end- market primarily consisted of sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue under maintenance service agreements and higher sales of spare parts. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Defense and space sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to logistics services (including the positive impact of the acquisition of Dimensions International, a defense logistics business), helicopter OE sales, an increase in government funded engineering related to the Orion (CEV) program, higher sales of specialty foam insulation, certain surface systems and classified space programs. \n\n##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit increased by 5 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to increased prices, productivity and sales volume growth. These increases are partially offset by inflation, the Consumables Solutions divestiture and higher spending to support new platform growth. \n\n2010 Areas of Focus \n\nAerospace&#146;s primary areas of focus for 2010 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Focus on cost structure initiatives to maintain profitability in the face of challenging commercial aerospace conditions; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Aligning inventory, production and research and development with customer demand and production schedules; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Expanding sales and operations in international locations; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Pursuit of new defense and space platforms; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Continuing to design equipment that enhances the safety, performance and durability of aerospace and defense equipment, while reducing weight and operating costs; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Delivering world-class customer service and achieving cycle and lead time reduction to improve responsiveness to customer demand; and \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Continued deployment of our common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. \n\n##TABLE_END 29 \n\nAutomation and Control Solutions (ACS) \n\nOverview \n\nACS provides innovative products and solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable.

Softness in residential and industrial end-markets was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly Norcross Safety Products. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Sales in our Solutions businesses decreased by 9 percent primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and volume decreases largely due to softening demand as a result of customer deferral of capital and operating expenditures. Orders decreased while backlog \n\n##TABLE_END 30 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; increased in 2009. Decreased orders are primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, softening demand (as noted above) and order timing and delays. Higher backlog is primarily due to longer duration projects. The impact of these factors was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly the RMG Group. \n\n##TABLE_END ACS segment profit decreased by 2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the negative impact of lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 5 percent increase in segment profit. \n\n2008 compared with 2007 \n\nACS sales increased by 12 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, including 10 percent net growth from acquisitions and divestitures. Although foreign exchange had minimal impact on full year sales, there was a 9 percent negative impact of foreign exchange on fourth quarter sales. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Sales in our Products businesses grew by 15 percent, including (i) the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly Norcross Safety Products, Metrologic Instruments, Hand Held Products Inc and Maxon Corporation, (ii) continued strong demand for life safety products, particularly fire systems and sensors and (iii) increased sales of our environmental and combustion products, driven by new products and demand for energy efficient controls, including growth across all regions.

This decrease is principally due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives and increased prices. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 56 percent increase in segment profit. \n\n2008 compared with 2007 \n\nSpecialty Materials sales increased by 8 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily driven by (i) increased pricing reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions (including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements), most significantly in Resins and \n\nChemicals and Fluorine Products, and (ii) an 8 percent increase in UOP sales as a result of higher volume sales in its products and projects businesses. Full year 2008 sales growth was partially offset by a 12 percent sales decline in revenue during the fourth quarter, primarily in our Resins and Chemicals business due to sharp declines in global demand for commodities such as caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. \n\nSpecialty Materials segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. This increase is due principally to increased UOP, Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals sales as a result of the factors discussed above and higher income from our joint ventures, partially offset by the impacts of hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the fourth quarter sales decline noted below. Overall, the effects of increased pricing reflecting the pass-through of higher raw material costs and other pricing actions (including benefits from formula based pricing arrangements) and productivity gains more than offset raw material (most significantly sulfur) and other inflation. \n\n2010 Areas of Focus \n\nSpecialty Materials primary areas of focus for 2010 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Continue to develop new processes, products and technologies that address energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, global warming, security regulations and position the portfolio for higher value; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Commercialize new products and technologies in the petrochemical, gas processing and refining industries; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Drive sales and marketing excellence and expand local presence in fast growing emerging markets; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Execution of awarded government stimulus projects and pursuit of additional projects; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Manage exposure to raw material commodity fluctuations; and \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Prioritize critical investment to increase plant reliability and attainment, productivity, quality and operational excellence. \n\n##TABLE_END Transportation Systems \n\nOverview \n\nTransportation Systems provides automotive products that improve the performance, efficiency, and appearance of cars, trucks, and other vehicles through state-of-the-art technologies, world class brands and global solutions to customers&#146; needs.

Diesel penetration rates in Western Europe declined in the first nine months of 2009 and there was a shift in consumer preference towards lower displacement engines. Full year 2009 sales decline was partially offset by a 22 percent sales increase during the fourth quarter primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange and higher sales volumes to our light vehicle engine manufacturing customers.

In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors and increased Turbo Technologies volumes resulted in a $66 million increase in Transportation Systems&#146; segment profit. We anticipate that new platform launches will translate into increased segment profit in 2010. \n\n2008 compared with 2007 \n\nTransportation Systems sales decreased by 8 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to lower volumes, most significantly in the second half of 2008, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Turbo Technologies sales decreased by 9 percent primarily due to decreased volume from a broad decline in vehicle production due to challenging automotive industry conditions in the U.S. and Europe, which accelerated in the second half of 2008, impacting sales to both our commercial and light vehicle engine manufacturers, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Consumer Products Group (&#147;CPG&#148;) sales decreased by 10 percent primarily due to lower sales of automotive aftermarket products reflecting lower miles driven and the impact of lower consumer confidence on discretionary spending, partially offset by higher prices (including the pass through of ethylene glycol cost increases). \n\n##TABLE_END 34 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Friction Materials sales were essentially unchanged, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and increased pricing offset by lower original equipment and aftermarket product sales volume. \n\n##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by 30 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to volume declines, as discussed above, material and non-material cost inflation and investments in product development to support future Turbo platforms.

Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $300 million in 2010 compared with 2009 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $200, $157 and $92 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions are expected to approximate $225 million in 2010 and will be funded through operating cash flows. \n\nThe following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2009 \n\n&#160; 2008 \n\n&#160; 2007 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (Dollars in millions) \n\nCash provided by (used for): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,946 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,791 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,911 \n\n&#160; Investing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (1,133 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (2,023 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (1,782 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (2,152 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (1,370 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (1,574 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 75 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (162 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 50 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 2009 compared with 2008 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $155 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a favorable impact from working capital of $577 million (primarily due to lower inventory), lower cash taxes of $449 million, and $155 million from the sale of long term receivables partially offset by decreased earnings, receipts from the sale of insurance receivables of $82 million in 2008 and higher repositioning payments of $43 million. \n\nCash used for investing activities decreased by $890 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a $1,713 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions (most significantly the acquisition of Norcross and Metrolgic in 2008) and a $275 million decrease in expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by a $908 million decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses (most significantly the divestiture of Consumables Solutions in 2008). \n\nCash used for financing activities increased by $782 million during 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a net repayment of debt (including commercial paper) in 2009 of $1,272 million compared to net proceeds (including commercial paper) of $733 million in 2008, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $1,459 million. \n\n2008 compared with 2007 \n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $120 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities of $475 million (decreased advances from customers and deferred income) and higher cash tax payments of $336 million (most significantly due to the sale of the Consumables Solutions business) partially offset by increased earnings, lower cash payments for asbestos of $121 million, and a decrease in working capital (lower accounts and other receivable offset by higher accounts payable). \n\nCash used for investing activities increased by $241 million during 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher spending for acquisitions partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of businesses. In 2008, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $2,181 million primarily for Safety Products Holding, Inc. (Norcross) and Metrologic Instruments, Inc. compared to $1,150 million in 2007, primarily for our acquisitions of Dimensions International, Enraf Holding B.V., Hand Held Products, Inc, and Maxon Corporation. Cash proceeds from divestitures were $909 million in 2008, compared to $51 million in 2007 primarily due to the sale of Consumables Solutions. \n\nCash used for financing activities decreased by $204 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a $2,527 million decrease in repurchases of common stock partially offset by decreases in net proceeds from debt (including commercial paper) of $1,797 million and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock primarily related to stock option exercises of $457 million. \n\nLiquidity \n\nEach of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to improve working capital turnover in 2010 to increase operating cash flows. Considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies, including our focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables. \n\nA source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions. There was $298 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009. \n\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2009, Standard and Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P) Fitch and Moody&#146;s have ratings on our long-term debt of A and A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. S&#38;P and Moody&#146;s have maintained Honeywell&#146;s ratings outlook as &#147;stable&#148;. Fitch&#146;s rating outlook is &#147;negative&#148;. In 2010, we will support our credit rating through debt repayments. To date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We maintain $2.8 billion of committed bank revolving credit facilities in support of our commercial paper program, which is secured through mid-May 2012. \n\nIn May 2007 Honeywell entered into a $2.8 billion Amended and Restated Five-Year Credit Agreement (&#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregated amount not to exceed $3.5 billion. This credit facility contains a $700 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper, At December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility. The Credit Agreement does not restrict Honeywell&#146;s ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. \n\nIn February 2009, the Company issued $600 million 3.875% Senior Notes due 2014 and $900 million 5.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (collectively, the &#147;2009 Senior Notes&#148;). The 2009 Senior Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell&#146;s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywell&#146;s subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1.5 billion, offset by $12 million in discount and issuance costs. Proceeds from the Senior Notes were used to repay outstanding commercial paper. \n\nIn August 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the RMG Group (RMG Regel + Messtechnik GmbH), a natural gas measuring and control products, services and integrated solutions company which will be integrated into our Automation and Control Solutions segment. The purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $416 million and was funded using available cash. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n\nWe sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. In April 2009, we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. This modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the Company balance sheet. As a result, $500 million of program receivables were reflected as Accounts, notes and other receivables with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These short-term borrowings were repaid as of December 31, 2009. \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. \n\nCurrent global economic conditions or the current tightening of credit could adversely affect our customers&#146; or suppliers&#146; ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. \n\nSpecifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2010 to be as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures&#151;we expect to spend approximately $700 million for capital expenditures in 2010 primarily for cost reduction, maintenance, replacement, growth, and production and capacity expansion. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Debt repayments&#151;there are $1,018 million of scheduled long-term debt maturities in 2010. We expect to refinance these maturities during 2010 utilizing short-term debt and reduce overall debt balances. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Share repurchases&#151;Under the Company&#146;s previously announced $3.0 billion share repurchase program, $1.3 billion remained available as of December 31, 2009 for additional share repurchases. The amount and timing of repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating and other investing activities. We do not anticipate any share repurchases during 2010. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Dividends&#151;we expect to pay approximately $940 million in dividends on our common stock in 2010, reflecting a 4 percent increase in the number of shares outstanding. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Asbestos claims&#151;we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $654 and $62 million, respectively, in 2010. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for further discussion. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Pension contributions&#151;In 2010, we are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements. However, we presently anticipate making voluntary contributions of approximately $400 million of Honeywell common stock to the U.S. plan in 2010 to improve the funded status of our plans. We also expect to make contributions to our non-U.S. plans of approximately $150 million in 2010. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension contributions. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Repositioning actions&#151;we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the previously announced repositioning actions will approximate $225 million in 2010. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Environmental remediation costs&#151;we expect to spend approximately $285 million in 2010 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END 39 \n\nWe continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2008 we realized $909 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. \n\nIn July 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace (&#147;B/E&#148;) for $1.05 billion, consisting of approximately $901 million in cash and six million shares of B/E common stock. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, this transaction resulted in a pre- tax gain of $623 million, $417 million net of tax. These proceeds, along with our other sources and uses of liquidity, as discussed above, were utilized to invest in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Based on our current financial position and expected economic performance, we do not believe that our liquidity will be adversely impacted by an inability to access our sources of financing. \n\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2009: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Total(6) \n\n&#160; Payments by Period \n\n&#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; 2010 \n\n&#160; 2011- 2012 \n\n&#160; 2013- 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (Dollars in millions) \n\nLong-term debt, including capitalized leases(1) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n7,264 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,018 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,211 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4,109 \n\n&#160; Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 3,140 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 297 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 489 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 374 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 1,980 \n\n&#160; Minimum operating lease payments \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 1,213 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 313 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 419 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 225 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 256 \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations(2) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 1,595 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 806 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 481 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 211 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 97 \n\n&#160; Estimated environmental liability payments(3) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 779 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 285 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 290 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 160 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 44 \n\n&#160; Asbestos related liability payments(4) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 1,694 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 654 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 563 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 266 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 211 \n\n&#160; Asbestos insurance recoveries(5) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (1,003 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (62 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (113 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (100 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (728 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n14,682 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,311 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,056 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,344 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,971 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n&#160;\n\n(2) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n&#160;\n\n(3) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2009.

See Note 6 to the financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. During 2010, we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. We also expect to make contributions to our non-U.S. plans of approximately $150 million in 2010. Beyond 2010, minimum statutory funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become significant. However, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $200 million in 2010 net of the benefit of approximately $14 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nFollowing is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\nGuarantees &#151;We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2009: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Maximum Potential Future Payments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (Dollars in millions) \n\nOperating lease residual values \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Other third parties&#146; financing \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 4 \n\n&#160; Unconsolidated affiliates&#146; financing \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 30 \n\n&#160; Customer financing \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 16 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\nIn connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. \n\nRetained Interests in Factored Pools of Trade Accounts Receivables &#151;As a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. The sold receivables ($500 million at December 31, 2008) are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The over-collateralization provides credit support to the purchasers of the receivable interest by limiting their losses in the event that a portion of the receivables sold becomes uncollectible. In April 2009, we modified the terms of the trade accounts receivable program to permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion. This modification provides additional flexibility in the management of the receivable portfolio and also requires the receivables in the program to remain on the Company balance sheet. As a result, $500 million of program receivables were reflected as Accounts, notes and other receivables with a \n\ncorresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These short-term borrowings were repaid as of December 31, 2009. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. \n\nWith respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. \n\nRemedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $318, $320 and $267 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $285 million in 2010. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. \n\nRemedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $151, $466 and $230 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $779 and $946 million, respectively. In addition, in 2009 and 2008 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $73 and $69 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nAlthough we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. \n\nSee Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nAs a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do \n\nnot use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements. \n\nWe conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, and Singapore dollar. \n\nOur exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. \n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2009 and 2008. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Face or Notional Amount \n\n&#160; Carrying Value(1) \n\n&#160; Fair Value(1) \n\n&#160; Estimated Increase (Decrease) In Fair Value \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (Dollars in millions) \n\nDecember 31, 2009 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,264 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,262 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,677 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(421 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 600 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (23 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts(2) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 2,959 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 79 \n\n&#160; Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForward commodity contracts(3) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 52 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 4 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 4 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2008 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,888 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,888 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,082 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(354 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts(2) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 3,030 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (27 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (27 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 126 \n\n&#160; Commodity Price Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForward commodity contracts(3) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 43 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Asset or (liability). \n\n&#160;\n\n(2) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. \n\n&#160;\n\n(3) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Changes in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions. \n\n##TABLE_END The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2009 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 to the financial statements. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#151;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities. These contingencies primarily relate to product liabilities (including asbestos), contractual matters, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including management&#146;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements. \n\nAsbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries &#151;We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrued for the probable value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21 to the financial statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of \n\npending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. We also accrue for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system. We value Bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous four years. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21 to the financial statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. At December 31, 2009, we have recorded insurance receivables of $831 million that can be specifically allocated to NARCO related asbestos liabilities. We also have $1.9 billion in coverage remaining for Bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#151;We maintain defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees and retirees. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations (see Note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Further information on all our major actuarial assumption is included in Note 22 to the financial statements. \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our 2009, 2008 and 2007 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2009 \n\n&#160; 2008 \n\n&#160; 2007 \n\nDiscount rate \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 6.95 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 6.50 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 6.00 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected rate of return \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual rate of return \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 20 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; (29 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; 9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 5.75 percent discount rate in 2010, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2008. We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 9 percent for 2010 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. The net losses for our pension plans were $7.6 billion at December \n\n31, 2009 compared with $6.0 billion at December 31, 2008. This increase of $1.6 billion is due primarily to lower discount rates in our plans partially offset by asset gains due to the performance of the equity markets in 2009. The net losses at December 31, 2009 principally result from lower discount rates in 2009 and actual plan asset returns below expected rates of return in 2008. As discussed in detail in Note 22 to the financial statements such losses have been recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. In the future we will continue to systematically recognize such net losses in net periodic pension expense. We use the market-related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period. Further, net losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans&#146; projected benefit obligation (the corridor) are recognized over a six-year period. \n\nChanges in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in Assumption \n\n&#160; Impact on Annual Pension Expense \n\n&#160; Impact on PBO \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate \n\n&#160; Increase $50 million \n\n&#160; Increase $350 million \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate \n\n&#160; Decrease $50 million \n\n&#160; Decrease $350 million \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Increase $27 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Decrease $27 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n##TABLE_END Net periodic pension expense for our pension plans is expected to be approximately $820 million in 2010, a $712 million increase from 2009 due principally to an increase in the amortization of net losses in our U.S. plans. The increase in the amortization of net losses results principally from asset losses due to the poor performance of the equity markets in 2008. \n\nIn 2009, 2008 and 2007 we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made voluntary contributions of $740, $242 and $42 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. During 2010, we plan to make additional voluntary contributions of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. Beyond 2010, minimum statutory funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become significant. However, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. We also expect to contribute approximately $150 to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2010 to satisfy regulatory funding standards. \n\nLong-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets) &#151;To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2009, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled $6.6 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; significant negative industry or economic trends; and \n\n##TABLE_END 46 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 to the financial statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $28 and $78 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized. \n\nGoodwill Impairment Testing &#151;Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. Our Goodwill balance, $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2009, is subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. \n\nWe completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2009 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Given the significant changes in the business climate and decline in mid-range forecasts for certain of our reporting units we re-tested goodwill for impairment in the second half of 2009. No impairment was indicated by this interim test. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. \n\nIncome Taxes &#151;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. \n\nAs of December 31, 2009, we recognized a net deferred tax asset of $3,028 million, less a valuation allowance of $578 million. Net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. \n\nOur net deferred tax asset of $3,028 million is comprised of $2,132 million related to U.S. operations and $896 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $2,132 \n\nmillion is comprised of net deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the U.S. and tax planning strategies. We maintain a valuation allowance of $8 million against such asset related to state net operating losses. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $896 million is comprised principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards, mainly in Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We maintain a valuation allowance of $570 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $133 million in 2009 and decreased by $45 million and $26 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#151;In 2009, we recognized approximately 15 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Specialty Materials segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n"}
