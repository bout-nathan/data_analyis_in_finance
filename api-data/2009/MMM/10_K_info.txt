As discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2009, 3M made certain business segment realignments, including both product moves between business segments and reporting changes related to revised U.S. performance measures. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Display and Graphics; and Electro and Communications. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s quarterly year-on-year business results got stronger as 2009 progressed, with first nine-month 2009 year-on-year comparisons significantly negatively impacted by the economic downturn that began impacting 3M in the fourth quarter of 2008. For total year 2009, while sales declined 8.5 percent and organic volumes declined 9.5 percent, worldwide industrial production is expected to be down by a similar amount and 3M&#146;s sales performance was in line with the overall economy. 3M restructured a number of businesses during the year, resulting in 2009 total year savings of almost $400 million, with estimated additional incremental savings of more than $150 million in 2010. In addition, 3M amended its policy regarding banked vacation, which added more than $100 million to operating income in 2009, with a slightly lower benefit expected in 2010. 3M also enacted temporary furloughs where appropriate, froze merit pay and reduced indirect spending. Finally, in the midst of this economic downturn, 3M invested $1.3 billion in research, development and related expenses during 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has been aggressively restructuring the company since early 2008 and continued this effort through the third quarter of 2009, with these restructuring actions and exit activities in the aggregate resulting in a reduction of approximately 6,400 positions. 3M aggressively reduced structural costs across the company, including in the factories. The focus now is to accelerate growth in the various businesses and to add only those expenses that are absolutely necessary. 3M announced the reduction of approximately 200 positions in the third quarter of 2009, with the majority of those occurring in Western Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States. In the second quarter of 2009, 3M permanently reduced approximately 900 positions spanning many businesses and geographies, and in the United States another 700 people accepted a voluntary retirement option. 3M expects that a small portion of those who accepted the voluntary separation will be replaced; thus, on a net basis, 3M estimates an employment level decline of approximately 1,400 to 1,500 due to these second quarter restructuring actions. In the first quarter of 2009, 3M announced the elimination of approximately 1,200 positions. In addition, 3M announced reductions of approximately 3,500 positions in 2008, with 2,400 of these reductions announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. The related net restructuring charges and other special items reduced net income attributable to 3M for year 2009 by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Special items reduced net income attributable to 3M for year 2008 by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, with $140 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2009 sales totaled $6.1 billion, an increase of 11.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008, with all business segments and major geographic areas showing improvement. Net income attributable to 3M was $935 million, or $1.30 per diluted share. This compares to $536 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, which includes the impact of restructuring and other special items, in the fourth quarter of 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in 2009 totaled $23.1 billion, a decrease of 8.5 percent from 2008. Including the preceding special items, net income attributable to 3M was $3.193 billion, or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2009, versus $3.460 billion, or $4.89 per diluted share, in 2008. In 2009, the global economic slowdown dramatically affected year-on-year comparisons for 3M&#146;s businesses. Substantial end-market declines and inventory takedowns in major industries, including automotive, consumer electronics and general industrial manufacturing, resulted in significantly lower sales and income. Accordingly, 3M reduced its cost structure, lowered manufacturing output and intensified its attention to operational improvement. The combination of these actions drove operating income margins of 20.8 percent in 2009, compared to 20.6 percent in 2008. Restructuring charges and other special items reduced this operating income margin by approximately one percentage point in both 2009 and 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business, resulting in a gain in the first quarter of 2007. In addition, 3M recorded a gain related to the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses in the second quarter of 2007. In 2007, these gains on sale of businesses were partially offset by restructuring and the net impact of other special items. Refer to &#147;Special Items&#148; at the end of this overview section for additional details. Including these special items, in 2007, 3M reported net sales of $24.462 billion and net income attributable to 3M of $4.096 billion, or $5.60 per diluted share. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; later in MD&#38;A for discussion by business segment of restructuring and other items that impacted reported operating income.

Quarterly year-on-year comparisons improved throughout 2009. Sales declined 21.3 percent in the first quarter, 15.1 percent in the second quarter and 5.6 percent in the third quarter, but improved 11.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Refer to the sections entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; and &#147;Performance by Geographic Area&#148; later in MD&#38;A for additional discussion of sales change. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2008, worldwide sales growth was 3.3 percent. Local-currency sales growth was 1.4 percent for 2008, including a 3.3 percentage point benefit from acquisitions. Local-currency sales increased 17.1 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services (including 13.0 percentage points from acquisitions), 6.7 percent in Health Care (including 1.7 percentage points from acquisitions), 4.1 percent in Industrial and Transportation (including 3.7 percentage points from acquisitions), and 1.0 percent in Consumer and Office (including 1.8 percentage points from acquisitions). Local-currency sales declined 1.6 percent in Electro and Communications and 17.9 percent in Display and Graphics. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M generated $4.9 billion of operating cash flows in 2009, an increase of $408 million when compared to 2008. This followed an increase of $287 million when comparing 2008 to 2007. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company utilized approximately $1.4 billion of cash each year to pay dividends. In February 2007, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. In February 2009, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is fully utilized. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $2.6 billion remained available for repurchase. With the Company&#146;s emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength, share repurchase activity was suspended beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008. The extension of this program provides flexibility to resume repurchase activity when business conditions permit. In 2009 no broker repurchases of stock were made, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ncompared to repurchases of 3M common stock of $1.6 billion in 2008 (primarily in the first nine months of 2008) and repurchases of 3M common stock of $3.2 billion in 2007. In February 2010, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 2.9 percent for 2010, marking the 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M&#146;s debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2009 was 30 percent, compared to 39 percent at December 31, 2008. A portion of the increase in debt at year-end 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the U.S. given the difficult market environment at that point in time. 3M has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. In addition to cash on hand, the Company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, the Company experienced cost decreases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. This was driven by lower basic feedstock costs, particularly metals and oil derived materials. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, 3M changed its annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant date to more closely align the award with the timing of the Company&#146;s performance review process. In 2009 and forward, under the annual grant, 3M will grant shares in February instead of May as in previous years. Accounting rules requires recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. 3M employees in the United States are eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years of service. Approximately 25 percent of the stock-based compensation award expense dollars are for this retiree-eligible population. Therefore, in 2007 and 2008, the second quarter of each year (because of the May grant date) reflected higher stock-based compensation expense than the other quarters. In 2009, the retiree-eligible impact shifted to the first quarter of 2009. In addition, both the first and second quarter of 2009 reflected higher stock-based compensation expense related to the earlier February grant date. These and other factors resulted in higher stock-based compensation cost in 2009 when compared to 2008. Refer to Note 16 for additional discussion of the Company&#146;s stock-based compensation programs. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s pension plans were 90 percent funded at year-end 2009. The U.S. qualified plan, which is approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded, and the international plans were 83 percent funded. Asset returns in 2009 for the U.S. qualified plan were 12.6 percent while the year-end 2009 discount rate was 5.77%, down 0.37 percentage points from the 2008 discount rate of 6.14%. 3M expects to contribute $500 million to $700 million of cash to its global pension plans in 2010. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2010. 3M expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2010 to increase by approximately $130 million pre-tax, or 12 cents per diluted share, when compared to 2009. Refer to critical accounting estimates within MD&#38;A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M&#146;s pension and post-retirement plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preceding forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward-looking statements section in Item 7 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecial Items: \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecial items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in the Company&#146;s underlying operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $194 million and net income attributable to 3M by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. 2009 included restructuring actions ($209 million pre-tax, $128 million after tax and noncontrolling interest), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($15 million pre-tax, $9 million after tax). The gain on sale of real estate relates to the June 2009 sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility, which is recorded in cost of sales within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment. Restructuring is discussed in more detail in Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities). \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2008, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $269 million and net income attributable to 3M by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. 2008 included restructuring actions ($229 million pre-tax, $147 million after-tax and noncontrolling interest), exit activities ($58 million pre-tax, $43 million after-tax) and losses related to the sale of businesses ($23 million pre-tax, $32 million after-tax), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($41 million pre-tax, $28 million after-tax). Divestiture impacts, restructuring actions and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nexit activities are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures) and Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities). Concerning the real estate gain, 3M received proceeds and recorded a gain in 2008 for a sale-leaseback transaction relative to an administrative location in Italy. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2007, gains on sale of businesses and real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased operating income by $681 million and net income attributable to 3M by $448 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. 2007 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of businesses ($849 million pre-tax, $550 million after-tax) and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million pre-tax, $37 million after-tax), which were partially offset by increases in other environmental liabilities ($134 million pre-tax, $83 million after-tax), restructuring actions ($41 million pre-tax, $27 million after-tax), and other exit activities ($45 million pre-tax, $29 million after-tax). These items, except the gain on sale of real estate, are discussed in more detail in Note 2 (Acquisitions and Divestitures), Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities) and Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies). Gains on sale of businesses include the second-quarter 2007 sale of 3M&#146;s Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses, and the first-quarter 2007 sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe. Concerning the real estate sale, 3M sold a laboratory facility located in Suwon, Korea. \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,123 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,090 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,269 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n36.8 \n\n% \n\n63.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n36.3 \n\n% \n\n63.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n(11.9 \n\n)% \n\n(8.1 \n\n)% \n\n(9.5 \n\n)% \n\n(5.0 \n\n)% \n\n(1.0 \n\n)% \n\n(2.4 \n\n)% \n\nVolume &#151; acquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5 \n\n) \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales (including acquisitions) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.0 \n\n) \n\n(4.7 \n\n) \n\n(5.6 \n\n) \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.6 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.4 \n\n) \n\n(2.8 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.3 \n\n)% \n\n(9.2 \n\n)% \n\n(8.5 \n\n)% \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n3.3 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn 2009, local-currency sales declined 5.6 percent.

Cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008. As discussed in Note 4 (Restructuring Actions and Exit Activities), in 2009, 3M recorded $209 million in restructuring charges, of which $110 million was recorded in cost of sales. This was partially offset by a $15 million gain on sale of a New Jersey roofing granule facility, which was also recorded in cost of sales. In 2008, $122 million in restructuring and exit activities were recorded in cost of sales. Thus, restructuring and other items were $27 million lower year-on-year, benefiting cost of sales by 0.1 percentage point. Other benefits to cost of sales as a percent of net sales included increases in selling prices and a slight \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ndecrease in material costs. The Company was also able to mitigate organic volume declines through reductions in 3M&#146;s manufacturing cost structure. Finally, in response to deteriorating conditions in Venezuela, 3M Venezuela swapped bolivars into U.S. dollars in 2009. While increasing cost of sales, these actions mitigated 3M&#146;s exposure to future exchange rate risks. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales as a percent of net sales increased 0.8 percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007, with this increase primarily due to the decline in Optical Systems sales and the rapid volume declines of certain other businesses in the fourth quarter. For the majority of the year 3M&#146;s broad-based portfolio performed as expected, with benefits from selling price increases, foreign currency translation, and a continuous focus on driving operational excellence, helping to offset raw material inflation of approximately 4 percent for 2008, compared with 2007. In 2008, restructuring and exit costs increased cost of sales by $122 million, or 0.4 percentage points as a percent of net sales, similar to the 0.3 percentage point impact in 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.4 percentage points in 2009 when compared to 2008, but in dollars decreased $338 million, helped by restructuring and other actions. In the sales and marketing area, advertising and merchandising costs were down year-on-year, but were up in the fourth quarter. As indicated in Note 4, in 2009, $91 million in restructuring expenses was recorded in SG&#38;A, which increased SG&#38;A as a percent of sales by 0.4 percentage points. In 2008, restructuring actions and exit activities, net of a gain on sale of real estate, increased SG&#38;A by $111 million, which increased SG&#38;A as a percent of sales by 0.5 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.3 percentage points in 2008 when compared to 2007, or 4.6 percent in dollars. In 2008, SG&#38;A expenses related to restructuring actions and exit activities were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined increased SG&#38;A by $111 million, or 0.5 percentage points, similar to the 0.4 percentage point impact in 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, as part of its restructuring program, 3M took aggressive actions to reduce general and administrative expenses and also pared back selling and marketing costs in certain businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&#38;D) were 5.6 percent of net sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007. R&#38;D expenses in dollars declined approximately 8 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, following an increase of 2.6 percent when comparing 2008 to 2007. 3M has continued to support its key larger programs, but overall dollar spending has been impacted by company-wide cost-cutting initiatives such as reductions in indirect spending and the banked vacation policy change. \n\n&#160; \n\nGain/Loss from Sale of Businesses: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2008, 3M completed the sale of HighJump Software to Battery Ventures, a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3M received proceeds of $85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million (recorded in the Safety, Security and Protection Services segment) in the second quarter of 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn January 2007, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe to Meda AB. 3M received proceeds of $817 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, a pre-tax gain of $781 million in 2007 (recorded in the Health Care segment). In June 2007, 3M completed the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses to TorQuest Partners Inc., a Toronto-based investment firm. 3M received proceeds of $80 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax gain of $68 million (recorded in the Display and Graphics segment) in 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income was 20.8 percent of sales in 2009 compared to 20.6 percent of sales in 2008. 2009 was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, net of a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by 0.9 percentage points ($194 million). 2008 was negatively impacted by restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses that were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by 1.1 percentage points ($269 million). Operating income margins of 25.3 percent in 2007 were positively impacted by 2.8 percentage points ($681 million) from the gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of environmental liabilities, restructuring and other exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Expense and Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n(37 \n\n) \n\n(105 \n\n) \n\n(132 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInterest Expense : Interest expense increased slightly in 2009, primarily due to higher average U.S. long-term debt balances largely offset by benefits from reduced short-term balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily related to higher average U.S. and international long-term debt balances, which were partially offset by lower short-term debt balances and interest rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Income: Interest income declined in 2009 when compared to 2008, primarily due to lower yields on investments. Interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher average cash and cash equivalent balances. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for Income Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Percent of pre-tax income) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n30.0 \n\n% \n\n31.1 \n\n% \n\n32.1 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.0 percent, compared with 31.1 percent in 2008, and 32.1 percent in 2007. In both 2009 and 2008, the Company&#146;s tax rate primarily benefited from reduced international tax rates.

The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which is 3M&#146;s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As discussed in Note 6, in the third quarter of 2009, 3M&#146;s effective ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited was reduced from 75 percent to 71.5 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $220 million in 2009 and increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $160 million in 2008 and $150 million in 2007. This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an immaterial impact in 2009, and increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $40 million in 2008 and by approximately $10 million in 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDisclosures relating to 3M&#146;s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industrial and Transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, energy control products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation is a large and highly diversified set of businesses that, when taken together, correlate well with the overall economy. Early in 2009, the business saw significant sales declines that required swift and aggressive restructuring and cost reduction plans to offset the impact of lower volumes, including the impact of large inventory declines in the wholesale distribution channel. Inventories began to stabilize around mid-year 2009, and it now appears that inventory and point-of-sale levels in this channel are in reasonably good balance. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Industrial and Transportation rose 10 percent to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter local-currency growth was 4.6 percent, which included organic volume growth of 3 percent. Fourth-quarter growth was led by the renewable energy business and the automotive OEM business. 3M also drove positive local-currency sales growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and in Dyneon LLC, which supplies flouropolymers and elastomers into the oil, gas and transportation industries. Other businesses in this segment posted local-currency sales declines ranging from one to five percent in the fourth quarter. On a regional basis, growth was strongest in Latin America and in Asia Pacific. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe combination of positive sales volumes in the quarter, higher year-on-year factory production levels and improvements in cost structure resulted in operating income growth in the fourth quarter. This segment recorded net charges of $36 million related to restructuring actions and exit activities in the fourth quarter of 2008. Including these net charges, o perating income in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 86 percent to $397 million and operating income margins improved by 8.5 percentage points to 20.8 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nFull-year 2009 sales were $7.1 billion, down 12.9 percent in dollars and down 10.2 percent in local currency. Foreign currency impacts penalized sales for the year by 2.7 percent. Sales increased in the renewable energy and automotive aftermarket businesses, but sales decreased in the other businesses, impacted by end-market declines. This segment announced restructuring actions in 2009, along with plant shut-downs, furloughs and mandatory vacation across the operation. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $88 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits of $83 million and fixed asset impairments of $5 million. Including these special items, 2009 operating income was $1.2 billion and operating income margins were 17.4 percent. This segment recorded $66 million related to restructuring and exit activities in 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation continued to invest aggressively to accelerate its growth capability. For example, the renewable energy business recently opened a new large-scale high-tech manufacturing site in Singapore, and the industrial abrasives business opened a new state-of-the-art manufacturing site in North America. Recently, 3M Purification Inc. launched a high-quality disposable filtration system for the biopharmaceuticals industry. And finally, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nthe automotive aftermarket business introduced the 3M &#153; Dirt Trap Protection System, which increases paint booth productivity and reduces daily maintenance costs in auto body repair shops. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2008 results: \n\n&#160; \n\n2008 can be characterized as a tale of two distinct chapters for Industrial and Transportation. The first was January through October, characterized by outstanding top-and bottom-line growth across most of the portfolio; the second chapter was the combined months of November and December, when many large customers slowed their operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nAmong 3M&#146;s business segments, Industrial and Transportation has been among those most affected by recent economic contractions, particularly in big industries such as automotive and electronics. With worldwide industrial production in decline, 3M&#146;s Industrial and Transportation business had fourth quarter 2008 sales of $1.7 billion, an 11.2 percent decline compared to 2007. Local-currency sales were down 6.4 percent, including a positive 3.1 percent impact from acquisitions. Not all divisions within Industrial were impacted equally in the fourth quarter. Those that are heavily linked to automotive manufacturing, namely automotive OEM and Dyneon LLC, saw declines of more than 20 percent, as did businesses selling to the electronics industry, such as high-tech tapes and adhesives. Most other divisions experienced local-currency sales contractions of less than 10 percent in the fourth quarter, with the exception of the automotive aftermarket business, which posted positive local-currency sales growth. Geographically, fourth quarter 2008 local-currency sales were down in all regions, with the largest declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, followed by Europe. Local-currency sales were flat in Latin America. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 42 percent to $214 million, which included net charges of $36 million for restructuring actions and exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nFull-year 2008 sales were up 7 percent to $8.2 billion. Local-currency growth rates were strongest in the automotive aftermarket business. 3M also drove strong sales growth in two of its largest divisions, namely abrasives and industrial tapes and adhesives. Closure systems for personal hygiene products also showed good growth. Geographically, all major regions drove positive local-currency sales growth. Strong market penetration continued in emerging economies, especially the high growth countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Poland, where the business drove strong organic local-currency growth. Operating income declined, but increased after adjusting for $66 million in restructuring actions and exit activities (discussed further below). Strong operational discipline was the key to protecting the bottom line as full-year operating margins totaled 18.9 percent, with operating income margins at 19.7 percent after adjusting for restructuring and exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation restructuring and exit activities totaled $66 million for total year 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008, restructuring actions totaling $40 million (partially offset by a $4 million reduction in previously accrued exit activity charges) were comprised of severance and related benefits totaling $33 million and asset impairments of $7 million. Net exit activity charges of $26 million in 2008 largely related to employee reductions at an Industrial and Transportation manufacturing facility located in the United Kingdom, which totaled $19 million. This compared to restructuring actions and exit activities of $9 million in 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation continued to invest in innovative new products along with complementary gap-fill acquisitions, evidenced by the closing of eight acquisitions in 2008, with some of the larger acquisitions summarized as follows. In July 2008, 3M acquired K&#38;H Surface Technologies Pty. Ltd., an Australian-based manufacturing company specializing in a range of repair products for the professional do-it-yourself automotive refinish markets. In August 2008, 3M acquired Polyfoam Products Inc., a structural adhesives company specializing in foam adhesives for tile roofing and other adhesive products for the building industry. In October 2008, 3M completed its acquisition of EMFI S.A. and SAPO S.A.S., manufacturers of polyurethane-based structural adhesives and sealants headquartered in Haguenau, France. In October 2008, 3M also completed its acquisition of Meguiar&#146;s Inc., a 100-year-old business that manufactures the leading Meguiar&#146;s brand of car care products for cleaning and protecting automotive surfaces, which is headquartered in Irvine, California. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2005, 3M&#146;s automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of TI&#38;M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&#38;M) for approximately $55 million. TI&#38;M is the parent company of I&#38;T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&#38;T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed the firm&#146;s flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&#38;T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&#38;M, the Company was granted a put option, which gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&#38;M to the other investors from whom 3M acquired its 19 percent interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&#38;M investors have filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria. The Company is pursuing recovery of the balance of \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nits investment both through the Austrian bankruptcy proceedings and pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company received approximately $6 million of its investment back in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded. \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care Business (18.6% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,294 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,303 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,980 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n13.6 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n% \n\n6.7 \n\n% \n\n18.2 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(23.5 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.8 \n\n) \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\n8.1 \n\n% \n\n(1.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,350 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,175 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,884 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n14.9 \n\n% \n\n(37.6 \n\n)% \n\n2.0 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n31.4 \n\n% \n\n27.3 \n\n% \n\n47.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Health Care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information systems. Products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems and anti-microbial solutions. As discussed in Note 2, 3M completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in Europe in January 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter sales in Health Care were $1.1 billion, up nearly 11 percent in dollars and up 6 percent in local currency. Foreign exchange impacts added nearly 5 percent to fourth quarter sales. Sales increased in every business within health care, most notably infection prevention, skin and wound care and health information systems. The orthodontics business also showed a nice rebound in the fourth quarter. Geographically, sales grew in all major areas led by Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2009 operating income increased to $375 million, or 32.7 percent of sales, with operating income growth driven by favorable product mix, good cost control and continued productivity efforts across the portfolio. Fourth quarter 2008 includes charges of $50 million for restructuring and exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the full year, sales were $4.3 billion, up 3.6 percent in local currencies. This growth was broad-based, with positive contributions from nearly all businesses. Sales growth was led by the infection prevention and skin and wound care businesses, which provide a multitude of products that improve patient treatment outcomes and increase efficiency for health care providers. 3M also drove positive local-currency sales growth in the oral care business. On a geographic basis, sales growth rates were highest in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada. \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care recorded charges of $20 million related to restructuring actions in 2009, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. In 2008, this business segment recorded charges of $60 million related to restructuring and exit activities. Including these charges, full-year operating income in Health Care grew 15 percent to $1.35 billion, with operating income margins of 31.4 percent in 2009. 3M&#146;s longer-term plan is to keep reinvesting in this business to drive higher growth, even if operating income margins at some point compress to the high-20&#146;s. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, the Health Care business invested in a number of areas to drive new products, accelerate growth and improve competitiveness. For example, 3M&#146;s drug delivery systems business entered the large and growing dry-powder inhaler segment. In wound care, 3M strengthened its market leadership in clear wound dressings with new 3M &#153; Tegaderm &#153; dressings for IV sites and chronic wound care. The dental business launched a number of new products, including new decay-preventative sealants, curing lights and impression material systems. In health information systems, 3M continued to launch solutions for the new International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) coding, inpatient/outpatient medical record coding, reimbursement and data connectivity. And finally, 3M opened or expanded major new R&#38;D and manufacturing facilities around the world, including China, Singapore, India, Brazil and Dubai. These investments are critical to 3M&#146;s growth acceleration plans around the globe. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2008 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, Health Care sales topped $1 billion, despite a nearly 7 percentage point penalty from currency translation. In local-currency terms, sales rose 4.3 percent, including 2.2 percent from acquisitions. 3M saw solid local-currency growth in the medical products area, specifically in core infection prevention and skin and wound care products. Geographically, the U.S. and Asia Pacific led sales growth. Operating income margins of 24.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 were the highest in the Company, which includes the impact of $50 million in restructuring and exit activity charges that reduced operating income margins by 4.9 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor full-year 2008, Health Care&#146;s results were strong, with sales increasing 8.1 percent to $4.3 billion and operating income margins of 27.3 percent. 2008 includes the impact of $60 million in restructuring and exit activities that reduced operating income margins by 1.4 percentage points. As discussed further below, 2007 operating income results include significant gains from the sale of 3M&#146;s pharmaceuticals business in January 2007, negatively impacting the 2008 versus 2007 year-on-year operating income comparison. Local-currency sales were up 6.7 percent, largely organic, but also included 1.7 percent from acquisitions. In 2008, 3M completed a number of important bolt-on acquisitions in Health Care, including TOP-Service, a German orthodontic technology and services company offering a digital lingual solution; Imtec, an Oklahoma-based manufacturer of dental implants and cone beam computed tomography; and Solumed, a Quebec-based developer and marketer of leading-edge medical products designed to prevent infections in operating rooms and hospitals. Full-year 2008 sales were led by strong increases in 3M&#146;s medical, dental and orthodontics businesses. Sales grew in all geographies, led by strong gains in Asia Pacific and Latin America. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2007 Health Care operating income by $791 million. As discussed in Note 2, in January 2007 the Company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the Europe region. The operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in Health Care, totaled $781 million. In addition, as discussed in Note 4, a net operating income gain of $10 million was recorded in 2007, which primarily related to adjustments to restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M believes the following disaggregated information for 3M Health Care&#146;s remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals) and for pharmaceuticals on a stand-alone basis provides useful information. \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care Business without Pharmaceuticals: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,294 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,303 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,980 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n13.6 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n% \n\n6.7 \n\n% \n\n18.2 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.8 \n\n) \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\n8.1 \n\n% \n\n22.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,350 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,175 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,088 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n14.9 \n\n% \n\n8.0 \n\n% \n\n34.4 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n31.4 \n\n% \n\n27.3 \n\n% \n\n27.3 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe following discussion provides information on 3M Health Care&#146;s remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals).

In 2008 compared to 2007, operating income increased 8.0 percent to $1.175 billion, while operating income margins were maintained in excess of 27 percent. Operating income in 2008 included $60 million in restructuring actions and exit activity charges, primarily comprised of severance and related benefits, but also including $14 million in asset impairments. 2007 included $5 million in restructuring expenses, primarily severance and related benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPharmaceuticals Business: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2007 pharmaceuticals operating income by $796 million.

In addition, as discussed in Note 4, a net operating income gain of $15 million was recorded in 2007, which primarily related to adjustments to restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products (do-it-yourself), home care products, protective material products, certain consumer retail personal safety products, and consumer health care products. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2009 sales were $887 million, up 11.4 percent in dollar terms and up 7.1 percent in local currencies. A number of businesses posted positive local-currency sales growth, including home care products, retail health care, and do-it-yourself and mass retail. Local-currency sales declined just slightly in the office products business as unemployment levels remain high and employers continue to act cautiously with respect to office supply purchases. Fourth-quarter operating income in Consumer and Office increased to $159 million, and operating income margins were 17.9 percent. Fourth-quarter 2008 includes $18 million in restructuring charges. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer and Office has executed a bolt-on acquisition strategy over the past couple of years. Acquisitions contributed 3.7 percent to fourth quarter local-currency sales growth, largely related to two purchases. In December 2008, 3M purchased Futuro, a leading supplier of braces, supports and compression hosiery. In July 2009, 3M purchased ACE Products, one of the strong consumer health care brands, from Becton, Dickinson. These investments, combined with 3M&#146;s own successful brands, provide critical mass in the retail drug store channel. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer and Office has a long and successful history of growth in the United States via strong, category-defining brands and an emphasis on customer relationships. 3M is leveraging this success outside the United States as well. Fourth-quarter sales rose more than 20 percent in Latin America, 14 percent in Asia Pacific and 8 percent in Europe. Operating income rose in all geographic regions as well. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the full year 2009, sales declined 3 percent to $3.5 billion, which was largely due to currency. Operating income margins were at 21.5 percent for the year, up over 2 percentage points versus 2008. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $13 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. 2008 includes $18 million in restructuring charges. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2008 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, Consumer and Office sales declined 9.6 percent to $796 million. Local currency sales were down 5 percent and currency impacts reduced sales by just under 5 percentage points. U.S. sales declined by 10 percent, heavily impacted by the slump in U.S. consumer retail spending levels. More than 50 percent of sales in Consumer and Office are generated within the United States. By far the biggest contributor to this decline was the \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nretail and wholesale office channel. The combination of massive office worker layoffs, coupled with across-the-board declines in office retail foot traffic, had a dramatic and negative impact on sales. 3M businesses serving other U.S. retail channels performed well in the fourth quarter despite the tough economic environment. This business posted positive local-currency sales for its home care products, such as Scotch-Brite&#174; Scrub Sponges, and for its do-it-yourself retail channel. Elsewhere around the globe, 3M&#146;s Consumer and Office business drove positive local-currency sales growth in both Latin America and Asia Pacific, but overall growth was muted by declines in Europe. Worldwide operating income declined in the fourth quarter, including the impact of $18 million in restructuring charges, which contributed 11.1 percentage points of this 35.7 percent decline. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2008, Consumer and Office sales grew 2.4 percent. This business has successfully created new products and designed new programs and planograms with their large U.S. customers in order to mitigate what is a very tough end-market situation. Sales growth was led by home care and do-it-yourself products. Acquisitions, primarily the do-it-yourself retail market portion of 3M&#146;s Aearo business, contributed 1.8 percentage points to sales growth. Operating income declined 3.8 percent and margins were in excess of 19 percent, a strong return considering the slow U.S. market environment and a synchronized slowdown in growth across most other areas of the world. Geographically, sales growth was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. Operating income was negatively impacted by the $18 million in restructuring charges discussed in the preceding paragraph. \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety, Security and Protection Services Business (13.8% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,180 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,450 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,944 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.4 \n\n) \n\n4.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n13.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n7.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.7 \n\n)% \n\n17.1 \n\n% \n\n10.7 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.9 \n\n) \n\n(1.8 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.2 \n\n) \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.8 \n\n)% \n\n17.2 \n\n% \n\n15.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n21.7 \n\n% \n\n8.4 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n23.4 \n\n% \n\n20.6 \n\n% \n\n19.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, safety and security products (including border and civil security solutions), cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, track and trace solutions, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles. In the second quarter of 2008, 3M completed the sale of its HighJump Software business which provided supply chain execution software solutions. 3M&#146;s Track and Trace Solutions utilize radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to provide a growing array of solutions &#151; from library patron self-checkout systems to tracking packages. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn Safety, Security and Protection Services, sales grew 13.5 percent in the fourth quarter, or 7.9 percent in local currency. Foreign exchange impacts added 5.6 percent to fourth quarter sales. Sales growth in the quarter was largely driven by the personal protection business. In May of 2009, 3M began to see a surge in orders for respirators approved for use in defending against the H1N1 virus. Since that time, demand has continued to exceed available supply. 3M recently approved respirator capacity investments in both Singapore and in the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\nElsewhere within this segment, local-currency sales growth was slightly positive in the building and commercial services business, driven by a number of new product introductions, but all other businesses posted lower year-on-year sales. In particular, 3M saw more than 10 percent local-currency sales declines in its industrial-oriented corrosion protection products business, and in businesses linked closely to residential construction, such as roofing granules. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter operating income increased to $201 million, with operating income margins at 24.3 percent. Fourth quarter 2008 included $12 million in restructuring expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nFull-year 2009 sales in Safety, Security and Protection Services totaled $3.2 billion, down 7.8 percent in dollar-terms and 2.7 percent in local currencies. 3M drove positive local-currency growth in personal protection products, but all other businesses posted declines for the full year. The global economic downturn negatively impacted the industrial and construction-related businesses within this segment. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDespite the near 8 percent sales decline for the year, operating income margins rose to 23.4 percent. In 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $17 million related to restructuring actions, comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. This charge was partially offset by a gain of $15 million related to the sale of 3M&#146;s New Jersey roofing granule facility. In the second quarter of 2008, 3M completed the sale of its HighJump Software business and recognized a pre-tax loss of $23 million. In addition, 3M recorded restructuring charges and exit activities that totaled $15 million in 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2009, 3M&#146;s Security Systems Division was notified that the UK government decided to award its passport production to a competitor upon the expiration of 3M&#146;s existing UK passport contract in October 2010. 3M remains confident in the future of this business, and the growth prospects remain strong. 3M continues to aggressively work to win additional contracts in other countries. Refer to &#147;Critical Accounting Estimates&#148; within &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; for additional discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2008 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, sales in this business rose 1.0 percent to $729 million. Local-currency sales increased 11.5 percent, driven by 3M&#146;s 2008 acquisition of Aearo Technologies. Acquisitions contributed 14.4 percentage points of growth in the fourth quarter. On a geographic basis, sales for the quarter were strongest in the United States, followed by the Asia Pacific region. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 10.5 percent, which included $12 million in restructuring expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nFull-year 2008 sales increased 17.2 percent. In local-currency terms, sales rose approximately 17 percent, comprised of 13 points from acquisitions and 2 points each from organic volumes and selling price increases. Sales growth was led by acquisitions, primarily Aearo, along with organic growth in personal protection solutions, cleaning and protection solutions for commercial buildings, and RFID solutions (Track and Trace). Aearo, acquired in April 2008, manufactures and sells personal protection and energy absorbing products. Aearo expanded 3M&#146;s platform by adding hearing protection as well as eyewear and fall protection product lines to 3M&#146;s existing line of respiratory products. In July 2008, 3M acquired Quest Technologies Inc., a manufacturer of environmental monitoring equipment, including noise, heat stress and vibration monitors. The sale of HighJump Software (discussed below) resulted in a 1.8 percentage point penalty to full-year sales. Worldwide operating income was up 21.7 percent to $710 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2008, 3M announced and completed the sale of its HighJump Software business and recognized a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the second quarter of 2008. In addition, 3M recorded restructuring charges and exit activities that totaled $15 million in 2008. Including the preceding 2008 items, operating income margins were in excess of 20 percent for 2008. In the second quarter of 2007, 3M recorded a restructuring charge of $29 million related to the phaseout of operations at its New Jersey roofing granule facility. This included fixed asset impairments and employee-related restructuring liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nDisplay and Graphics Business (13.5% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,132 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,268 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,916 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.6 \n\n) \n\n(18.0 \n\n)% \n\n2.6 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n) % \n\n(17.9 \n\n) % \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\n(0.4 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.2 \n\n) % \n\n(16.6 \n\n) % \n\n4.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,166 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n% \n\n(50.0 \n\n) % \n\n11.3 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n18.8 \n\n% \n\n17.8 \n\n% \n\n29.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Display and Graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, traffic safety and commercial graphics. This segment includes optical film solutions for electronic displays; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; commercial graphics systems; and projection systems, including mobile display technology and visual systems products. The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvarious patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3M&#146;s optical film patents begin to expire in the next few years, 3M will likely see more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3M&#146;s proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nDisplay and Graphics fourth quarter sales increased nearly 19 percent to $817 million. Sales grew 15.7 percent in local currencies, and foreign exchange impacts added just over 3 percentage points to the fourth quarter growth rate. Operating income increased to $141 million. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008 included net charges of $22 million for restructuring actions and exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nOptical systems continued to grow in the fourth quarter, with sales up over 50 percent year-on-year. Innovation was the key driver, as 3M film technology effectively improves the energy efficiency of an LCD panel by over 30 percent and can greatly simplify its design. Sales of optical films began to accelerate in the second and third quarter of 2009, and even though fourth-quarter sales declined sequentially due to normal seasonal reductions, year-on-year growth rates were strong. Optical will remain intensely competitive going forward. 3M&#146;s OEM customers continue to drive price reductions, and 3M will need to continue to respond with aggressive cost reduction and productivity in order to fund new products. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter local-currency sales were up slightly in traffic safety systems, driven by the December 2008 acquisition of a finished license plate provider in France. Sales in the commercial graphics business were flat sequentially versus third-quarter and declined year-on-year as advertising spending remains soft. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the full year, sales in Display and Graphics declined 4 percent to $3.1 billion, and operating income increased 1.3 percent to $590 million. Sales grew in traffic safety systems and optical systems, but declined in commercial graphics as the global recession significantly slowed spending on corporate advertising. In 2009, operating income margins were 18.8 percent, negatively impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to net restructuring charges of $22 million. This net aggregate charge included fixed asset impairments of $13 million and employee-related severance/benefits/other of $9 million, which is recorded net of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges. In 2008, restructuring charges and exit activities reduced operating income by $42 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nDisplay and Graphics is working aggressively to accelerate longer-term growth possibilities for the business. For example, this segment formed a new architectural markets business to further 3M&#146;s footprint in film solutions for interior surfaces and for energy efficient lighting solutions. Display and Graphics also formed a new mobile interactive solutions business to develop products that improve projection, personalization and privacy for mobile device users. In addition, this segment announced a unique optical film that enables 3D viewing on handheld devices without the need for 3D glasses. Finally, Display and Graphics is preparing to launch the third in a family of pocket projectors, the 3M&#153; MPro 150, which projects high-quality images up to 50 inches. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2008 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nResults in this business were affected by end-market challenges in 3M&#146;s optical films business. Demand for optical films slowed considerably in November and December of 2008 as TV, desktop monitor and notebook PC makers cancelled orders for large-size LCD panels due to weak holiday season sales, reflecting the global downturn in both consumer and corporate demand. For the fourth quarter, 3M posted sales of $687 million in Display and Graphics. Sales declined 28 percent, or about 8 percent excluding optical. Traffic safety systems posted local-currency sales growth of nearly 3 percent, as highway infrastructure projects around the world grew at a modest rate. Local-currency sales declined by 6.2 percent in 3M&#146;s commercial graphics business and by 48 percent in optical systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 80 percent, which included net charges of $22 million for restructuring and exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the full year of 2008, sales declined 16.6 percent, driving operating income down 50 percent to $583 million. Operating margins were at 17.8 percent for 2008. 3M took aggressive action during 2008 to reduce its cost structure across all businesses within Display and Graphics with particular focus on the optical film business. Second-half 2008 restructuring charges and exit activities of $42 million reduced operating income for total year 2008. These expenses were comprised of severance/related benefits and asset impairments. In 2007, 3M recorded a gain on the sale of its Opticom Priority Control Systems and Canoga Traffic Detection businesses, which was partially offset by expenses related to restructuring and exit activities. These items on a combined basis benefited operating income by $51 million in 2007. In aggregate, these items contributed approximately 6 percentage points of this 50 percent operating income decline when comparing 2008 to 2007. In addition, the 2008 restructuring and exit activity charges reduced 2008 operating income margins by 1.3 percentage points, while the 2007 net benefit contributed 1.3 percentage points of the 29.8 percent operating income margin for 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nElectro and Communications Business (9.8% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,276 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,835 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,805 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales (volume and price) \n\n&#160; \n\n(18.4 \n\n) \n\n(2.0 \n\n)% \n\n(0.5 \n\n)% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(17.8 \n\n)% \n\n(1.6 \n\n)% \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n) \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(19.7 \n\n)% \n\n1.1 \n\n% \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n(40.4 \n\n)% \n\n7.9 \n\n% \n\n19.3 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n14.2 \n\n% \n\n19.1 \n\n% \n\n17.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Electro and Communications segment serves the electrical, electronics and communications industries, including electrical utilities; electrical construction, maintenance and repair; original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electrical and electronics; computers and peripherals; consumer electronics; telecommunications central office, outside plant and enterprise; as well as aerospace, military, automotive and medical markets; with products that enable the efficient transmission of electrical power and speed the delivery of information. Products include electronic and interconnect solutions, micro interconnect systems, high-performance fluids, high-temperature and display tapes, telecommunications products, electrical products, and touch screens and touch monitors. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2009 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nElectro and Communications continued to gather momentum in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth-quarter sales increased 1.7 percent sequentially, and were also up 4.6 percent year on-year. Local-currency sales were up 1.4 percent year-on-year, led by businesses that supply the consumer electronics and semiconductor industries. 3M&#146;s infrastructure-related businesses in telecommunications and commercial construction remained challenging in the fourth quarter. \n\n&#160; \n\nElectro and Communications posted year-on-year operating income improvement in the fourth quarter, with operating income margins approaching 19 percent for the second consecutive quarter. The fourth quarter of 2008 included $7 million in restructuring expenses. Electro and Communications is driving operational efficiencies in the business to offset what has been an extremely challenging global business environment. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales for the full-year 2009 were $2.3 billion, down 19.7 percent, with local-currency sales declining 17.8 percent, foreign currency translation reducing sales by 1.7 percent, and divestitures reducing sales by 0.2 percent. The global economic downturn weighed heavily on all businesses, particularly telecom infrastructure, commercial construction and utilities. Operating income for the year was $322 million, with operating income margins of 14.2 percent. Operating income in 2009 included charges of $11 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. Operating income in 2008 was impacted by $7 million in restructuring expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nIn Electro and Communications, 3M was encouraged by the fourth quarter sales improvement and the progress in streamlining the cost structure of the business in 2009. In addition, this business has recently developed and introduced a number of new products, including solutions for touch-enabled mobile handheld devices and smart phones. Other recent product launches include electrically conductive optically clear adhesives, wafer handling systems for semiconductor manufacturing, a new line of voltage terminations and splices and new closures and cross-connect blocks for telecom appliances. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth quarter and year 2008 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nThis business serves a number of end-markets, the most important being consumer electronics and telecommunications, along with the global power utility industry. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the weak holiday season experienced by the consumer electronics retailers had a large and negative impact on sales in this business. Likewise the global telecommunications sector continued to cut capital spending on new capacity and on upgrades of existing equipment. 3M had a large number of equipment orders cancelled during the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of this end-market contraction, sales in Electro and Communications declined by 15 percent in the fourth quarter. Sales in local currency decreased about 12 percent, and currency impacts hurt sales by about 3 percentage points. Operating income declined 38 percent, which included $7 million in restructuring expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the full-year 2008, sales in Electro and Communications increased 1 percent to $2.8 billion, while operating income increased 8 percent to $540 million. Operating margins were at 19 percent. The Electrical Markets and Electronic Markets Materials businesses drove growth. The Communications Markets and Electronics Solutions businesses remained soft. 3M also continued to experience declines in the flexible circuits business where a number of product solutions were going end-of-life. Operating income in 2008 was impacted by $7 million in restructuring expenses, while 2007 included $18 million in restructuring expenses, primarily for asset impairment charges related to the Company&#146;s decision to close a facility in Wisconsin, and $23 million for employee reductions and fixed asset impairments related to the consolidation of certain flexible circuit manufacturing operations. In aggregate, these items contributed 6.7 percentage points of the reported 7.9 percent operating income growth when comparing 2008 to the 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M&#146;s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M&#146;s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18. Operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items. In 2009, restructuring actions, partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $194 million, with the largest impact in Europe, Asia Pacific and the United States. In 2008, restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses, which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $269 million, with the largest impact in the United States and Europe. In 2007, the gain on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased worldwide operating income by $681 million, with the largest impact in Europe. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of key information and discussion related to 3M&#146;s geographic areas follow: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited \n\nStates \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, \n\nMiddle East \n\nand Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America/ Canada \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\nUnallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,509 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,120 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,972 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,516 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,123 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n36.8 \n\n% \n\n26.5 \n\n% \n\n25.8 \n\n% \n\n10.9 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n(11.9 \n\n) \n\n(3.4 \n\n)% \n\n(11.9 \n\n)% \n\n(10.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(9.5 \n\n)% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n) \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(9.4 \n\n) \n\n(5.3 \n\n) \n\n(10.0 \n\n) \n\n(1.4 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.7 \n\n) \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.0 \n\n) \n\n(4.8 \n\n) \n\n(6.5 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.6 \n\n) \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.4 \n\n) \n\n(7.6 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n) \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.3 \n\n) \n\n(4.7 \n\n)% \n\n(14.0 \n\n)% \n\n(7.6 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(8.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,640 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,814 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n3.9 \n\n% \n\n(8.1 \n\n)% \n\n(22.5 \n\n)% \n\n(9.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.7 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor total year 2009, as shown in the preceding table, all major geographic areas showed sales declines; however, year-on-year sales growth improved each quarter throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2009, sales growth of 11.1 percent was broad-based. Every major geographic region expanded sales, with strong performances in Asia Pacific at 22 percent and Latin America and Canada each at 19 percent. With respect to organic volume, Asia Pacific led the way at nearly 19 percent for the fourth quarter. Korea, China and Taiwan posted the most significant increases, driven by a combination of improved local demand along with the pickup in global electronics. Organic volumes were flat to slightly down in other geographic regions, which is an improvement versus the levels of decline seen in the first three quarters of 2009. For 2009, international operations represented approximately 63 percent of 3M&#146;s sales. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America/ Canada \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Unallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,423 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,723 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,269 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n36.3 \n\n% \n\n25.4 \n\n% \n\n27.5 \n\n% \n\n10.8 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.0 \n\n)% \n\n(3.6 \n\n)% \n\n(1.5 \n\n)% \n\n7.4 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4 \n\n)% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.1 \n\n) \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.6 \n\n) \n\n(6.7 \n\n) \n\n(0.4 \n\n) \n\n9.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n) \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nLocal-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.9 \n\n) \n\n2.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.6 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n(2.7 \n\n)% \n\n6.7 \n\n% \n\n15.1 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,578 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,662 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,294 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n5,218 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n(16.7 \n\n)% \n\n(19.4 \n\n)% \n\n(20.4 \n\n)% \n\n12.6 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n% \n\n(15.7 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn 2008, U.S. local-currency sales increased 2.7 percent, with acquisitions contributing 5.3 percentage points. U.S. organic local-currency sales growth was led by Health Care. Safety, Security and Protection Services and Industrial and Transportation also drove positive sales growth, helped by acquisitions. This was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the U.S. housing, road construction and mass retail markets and office supply businesses. Asia Pacific local-currency sales declined 5.9 percent. The significant decrease in Optical Systems within Display and Graphics more than offset the sales growth in the other five business segments. Sales in Japan totaled approximately $2.2 billion, with local-currency sales down 5.2 percent from 2007. Europe local-currency sales increased 2.8 percent, helped by acquisitions, with growth in Safety, Security and Protection Services, Health Care, and Industrial and Transportation. In the combined Latin America and Canada area, local-currency sales increased 12.8 percent, with growth in all business segments. Foreign currency translation positively impacted Europe sales by 4.0 percent, the combined Latin America and Canada area sales by 2.4 percent, and the Asia Pacific area by 3.2 percent, as the U.S. dollar \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nweakened in aggregate against currencies in these geographic areas. For 2008, international operations represented approximately 64 percent of 3M&#146;s sales. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeographic Area Supplemental Information \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployees as of December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - net \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions, except Employees) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\n31,513 \n\n&#160; \n\n33,662 \n\n&#160; \n\n34,138 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,809 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,901 \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\n13,834 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,960 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,970 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,366 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,304 \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East &#160; and Africa \n\n&#160; \n\n17,743 \n\n&#160; \n\n19,185 \n\n&#160; \n\n17,675 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,318 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,263 \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America and Canada \n\n&#160; \n\n11,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,376 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,456 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Company \n\n&#160; \n\n74,835 \n\n&#160; \n\n79,183 \n\n&#160; \n\n76,239 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,471 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,422 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,886 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nEmployment: \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2009, employment declined by 4,348 positions since year-end 2008, largely driven by restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, employment increased by approximately 2,900 positions since year-end 2007, with acquisitions during 2008 adding approximately 3,700 positions as of December 31, 2008. In 2008, 3M added employees in Brazil, India, Russia, China and Poland, where total sales increased more than 15 percent. These increases were offset by reductions in employment in 2008 for a portion of the job eliminations that were announced in connection with restructuring and exit activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe bulk of 3M capital spending historically has been in the United States, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the United States. The Company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 63 percent of sales are outside the United States, this would increase production outside the United States, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital requirements. The dollar amounts in the preceding table support this trend, as international capital spending as a percent of worldwide capital spending increased from 41 percent in 2007 to 49 percent in 2009. Capital expenditures were $903 million in 2009, compared to $1.471 billion in 2008 and $1.422 billion in 2007. In response to global economic conditions, the Company reduced its capital spending significantly in 2009. A substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations. The Company expects 2010 capital spending to be approximately $1 billion as 3M continues to fund growth opportunities around the world. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES &#160; Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company&#146;s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\nLegal Proceedings: &#160; The categories of claims for which the Company has estimated its probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled &#147;Accrued Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings&#148; (contained in &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; in Note 14) for additional information about such estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation &#151; Retirement Benefits , in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders&#146; equity. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant&#146;s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. The assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.77% for U.S. pension and 5.62% for U.S. postretirement to be appropriate as of December 31, 2009, which is a decrease from the 6.14% rate used as of December 31, 2008. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of December 31, 2009 was 5.30%, a decrease from the 5.53% rate used as of December 31, 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nA significant element in determining the Company&#146;s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715, is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2010 is 8.50%, the same as 2009. Refer to Note 11 for information on how the 2010 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 6.89% for 2010, comparable to the weighted average expected return of 6.86% for 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized total consolidated pre-tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $176 million, up from $89 million in 2008. Pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $300 million in 2010. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase 2010 pension expense by approximately $27 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $10 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase 2010 pension expense by approximately $33 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $17 million for international pension plans. See Note 11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation. \n\n&#160; \n\nAsset Impairments: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2009, net property, plant and equipment totaled $7.0 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.3 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. Impairments recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in Note 4. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn June 2009, 3M&#146;s Security Systems Division (within the Safety, Security and Protection Services business segment) was notified that the UK government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3M&#146;s existing UK passport contracts in October 2010. 3M remains confident in the future of its overall passport business, and the growth prospects remain strong. 3M continues to aggressively work to win additional contracts in other countries. However, as a result of this event, in June 2009, 3M tested the long lived assets associated with the UK passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives. In addition, 3M tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit (Security Systems Division) level. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe result of the June 2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the UK passport activity indicated that the asset grouping&#146;s carrying amount of approximately $54 million (before impairment) exceeded the remaining expected cash flows. Accordingly, 3M recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value. In addition, accelerated depreciation/amortization is being taken over the period June 2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2009, which, based on impairment testing, is not impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3M has six business segments at December 31, 2009), but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. As of December 31, 2009, 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. \n\n&#160; \n\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. 3M completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2009, 3M had 37 primary reporting units, with eight reporting units accounting for approximately 75 percent of the goodwill. These eight reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M Purification Inc., Occupational Health and Environmental Safety, Optical Systems, 3M ESPE, Communication Markets, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Security Systems, and Health Information Systems. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair values for the majority of reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent. The fair values for 3M Purification Inc., Optical Systems and Security Systems, based on fourth quarter 2009 testing, were in excess of carrying value by approximately 15 percent to 30 percent, with no impairment indicated. As part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for its 3M Purification Inc., Optical Systems and Security Systems divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management&#146;s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, for those reporting units whose fair value was in excess of carrying value by more than 30 percent, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units. In 2008, 3M adjusted the stated applicable industry price-earnings ratio downward for its annual test in the fourth quarter, unlike prior years when no adjustment was required. Without this adjustment, the addition of each reporting unit&#146;s estimated market values would have been significantly in excess of 3M&#146;s total Company market value, which would have resulted in an unusually high implied control premium. The control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3M&#146;s total Company market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total Company. For example, at year-end 2008, 3M&#146;s market value was approximately $40 billion, but if each reporting unit was sold individually, 3M&#146;s value would be approximately $52 billion using a 30 percent control premium. 3M factored down its price/earnings ratio significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the price/earnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of approximately 30 percent for the total Company. Even after including this adjustment to the price-earnings ratio, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units in 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009, 3M&#146;s estimated control premium ranged from 15 to 30 percent, with no adjustment required to the price/earnings ratios. Based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2009, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. In addition, 3M&#146;s market value at December 31, 2009 of approximately $59 billion is significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $13 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges, among others, include changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148;, of this document. As of December 31, 2009, 3M had approximately $1 billion of goodwill related to 3M Purification Inc., $800 million related to Optical Systems, and $200 million of goodwill associated with the Security Systems Division. If future non-cash impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2010 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe extent of 3M&#146;s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, the Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company&#146;s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company&#146;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \n\n&#160; \n\nThe strength of 3M&#146;s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3M reliable access to capital markets. As indicated in the following table, at December 31, 2009, 3M had $4.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $5.710 billion of debt. Debt included $5.097 billion of long-term debt, $522 million related to the current portion of long-term debt and other borrowings of $91 million. The current portion of long-term debt includes $350 million in Dealer Remarketable Securities, which ultimately mature in December 2010. While economic conditions remain uncertain, 3M is committed to managing its capital structure very carefully. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company generates significant ongoing cash flow. A portion of the increase in debt at year-end 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the U.S. given the difficult market environment at that point in time. Increases in long-term debt have been used to partially fund share repurchase activities and acquisitions. On April 1, 2008, 3M (Safety, Security and Protection Services Business) completed its acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Aearo &#151; a global leader in the personal protection industry that manufactures and markets personal protection and energy absorbing products &#151; for approximately $1.2 billion, inclusive of debt assumed, which was immediately paid off. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,710 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,718 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,920 \n\n&#160; \n\nLess: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; \n\n4,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,574 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,955 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,101 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,965 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2009 totaled approximately $4.6 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of $4.9 billion. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company&#146;s stock. However, the Company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3M common stock (refer to Note 10 in this document). \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $5.898 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $3.759 billion at December 31, 2008. Working capital increases were attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and accounts receivable, while decreases in short-term debt, accrued income taxes and other current liabilities also increased working capital. This was partially offset by working capital increases attributable to increases in accounts payable and accrued payroll, combined with decreases in inventory and other current assets. \n\n&#160; \n\nPrimary short-term liquidity needs are met through U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. The Company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3M to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. As of December 31, 2009, 3M had no outstanding commercial paper, compared to $575 million in total commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008. The Company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. Effective April 30, 2007, the Company has a $1.5-billion five-year credit facility, which has provisions for the Company to request an increase of the facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders&#146; discretion), and providing for up to $150 million in letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, available short-term committed lines of credit, including the preceding $1.5 billion five-year credit facility, totaled approximately $1.593 billion, of which approximately $145 million was utilized for letters of credit and other short-term borrowings in connection with normal business activities. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has a &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; shelf registration statement, effective February 17, 2009, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. No securities have been issued under this shelf. The Company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. In connection with a prior &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; shelf registration, in June 2007 the Company established a $3 billion medium-term notes program. Three debt securities have been issued under this medium-term \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nnotes program. First, in December 2007, 3M issued a five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65%. Second, in August 2008, 3M issued a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375%. Third, in October 2008, the Company issued a three-year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.50%. The Company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this $800 million note to a floating rate. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. At December 31, 2009, $350 million of Dealer Remarketable Securities had ratings triggers (BBB-/Baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. In addition, under the $1.5-billion five-year credit facility agreement, 3M is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2009, this ratio was approximately 27 to 1. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2009 totaled $3.040 billion, with an additional $1.569 billion in current and long-term marketable securities. 3M&#146;s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.431 billion in 2009, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2010, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 2.9 percent to 52.5 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.10 per share. In February 2007, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. In February 2009, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is fully utilized. At December 31, 2009, the Company has $2.6 billion remaining under this authorization. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, the Company expects to contribute in cash an amount in the range of $500 million to $700 million to its U.S. and international pension plans. The Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2010. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. qualified plans&#146; funded status as of the 2010 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales &#151; fourth quarter at year-end &#151; multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.5 at December 31, 2009, a significant improvement from 4.5 at December 31, 2008. Receivables increased $55 million, or 1.7 percent, compared with December 31, 2008. Currency translation increased accounts receivable by $82 million year-on-year, as the U.S. dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of currencies. Inventories decreased $374 million, or 12.4 percent, compared with December 31, 2008. Currency translation increased inventories by $71 million year-on-year. Accounts payable increased $152 million compared with December 31, 2008. Currency translation increased accounts payable by $17 million year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income including noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,244 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,520 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,151 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n1,157 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,153 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,072 \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany pension contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(659 \n\n) \n\n(421 \n\n) \n\n(376 \n\n) \n\nCompany postretirement contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(133 \n\n) \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\nCompany pension expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany postretirement expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLoss/(gain) from sale of businesses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(849 \n\n) \n\nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(44 \n\n) \n\n(34 \n\n) \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n(14 \n\n) \n\n(21 \n\n) \n\n(74 \n\n) \n\nAccounts receivable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(35 \n\n) \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(127 \n\n) \n\n(54 \n\n) \n\nAccounts payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(224 \n\n) \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\nProduct and other insurance receivables and claims \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n(329 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(189 \n\n) \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,941 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,533 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,246 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, which is considered a non-cash financing activity. This non-cash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2009, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $408 million compared to 2008. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year working capital improvements of $771 million (which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable). In addition, lower cash tax payments in 2009 benefited cash flows. These positive contributions were partially offset by a decrease of $276 million in net income including noncontrolling interest. The category, &#147;Other-net,&#148; in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts. This includes the impact of cash outlays for restructuring payments, net of restructuring expenses, which on a combined basis reduced liabilities (Note 4). In addition, decreases in banked vacation accruals reduced liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2008, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $287 million. Net income including noncontrolling interest decreased $631 million, primarily due to gains from the sale of businesses in 2007 which did not repeat in 2008. Accounts receivable decreases benefited cash flows in 2008, but increases in inventories and decreases in accounts payable negatively impacted cash flows. The category &#147;Other-net&#148; in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including outstanding liabilities at December 31, 2008 related to 3M&#146;s restructuring actions (Note 4). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(903 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,471 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,422 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from sale of PP&#38;E and other assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired \n\n&#160; \n\n(69 \n\n) \n\n(1,394 \n\n) \n\n(539 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from sale of businesses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n(839 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(406 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,732 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,399 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,367 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In response to global economic conditions, the Company reduced its capital spending significantly in 2009. A substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations. The Company expects 2010 capital spending to be approximately $1 billion as 3M continues to fund growth opportunities around the world. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2008, major facility efforts included completion of production lines in the United States for both Consumer and Office and Health Care, an R&#38;D laboratory in Korea, a tape building in Poland, and numerous tape lines and building expansions in China. In 2008, 3M also made progress towards completion of investments in a Singapore multi-purpose manufacturing facility and film production facilities and made progress towards completion of manufacturing cost reduction investments in two of its U.S. film manufacturing plants. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2007, numerous plants were opened or expanded internationally. This included two facilities in Korea (respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant), industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both Brazil and the Philippines, a plant in Russia (corrosion protection, industrial adhesive and tapes, and respirators), a plant in China (optical systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, and personal care), an expansion in Canada (construction and home improvement business), in addition to investments in India, Mexico and other countries. In addition, 3M expanded manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions. Note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. The coupon interest rates for asset-backed securities are either fixed rate or floating. Floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly LIBOR rate. Each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective LIBOR rate +/- an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. Terms of the reset are unique to individual securities. Fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond. The spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3M&#146;s diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $1.569 billion as of December 31, 2009. In 2005, 3M purchased 19 percent of TI&#38;M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH for approximately $55 million. In 2008 and 2007, the recovery of approximately $6 million and $25 million, respectively, reduced &#147;Investments&#148; and is shown in cash flows within &#147;Proceeds from sale of marketable securities and investments.&#148; This investment is discussed in more detail under the preceding section entitled Industrial and Transportation Business.

As discussed earlier, a portion of the increase in debt at year-end 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the U.S. given the difficult market environment at that point in time. Total debt was 30 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity), compared with 39 percent at year-end 2008 and 29 percent at year-end 2007. The net change in short-term debt is primarily due to commercial paper activity. In 2009, repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days includes a $400 million medium-term note that matured in November 2009 and also includes repayments of commercial paper. In 2008, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days primarily represents debt acquired upon the acquisition of Aearo that was immediately repaid and repayment of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days. In 2007, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days is primarily comprised of commercial paper repayments of approximately $1.15 billion and the November 2007 redemption of approximately $322 million in Convertible Notes. In 2008, proceeds from debt primarily include a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note issued in August 2008 with a coupon rate of 4.375%, and a three-year, $800 million, fixed rate note issued in October 2008 with a coupon rate of 4.5% (refer to Note 10 for more information). In 2007, proceeds from debt included long-term debt and commercial paper issuances totaling approximately $4 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company&#146;s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2007, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from February 12, 2007 to February 28, 2009. In 2009, the Company had no broker purchases of treasury stock. In 2008, the Company purchased $1.6 billion in shares. In 2007, the Company accelerated purchases of treasury stock when compared to prior years, buying back $3.2 billion in shares. In February 2009, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is fully utilized. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $2.6 billion remained available for repurchase. For more information, refer to the table titled &#147;Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148; in Part II, Item 5. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $1.431 billion ($2.04 per share), $1.398 billion ($2.00 per share) in 2008 and $1.380 billion ($1.92 per share) in 2007. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2010, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 2.9 percent to 52.5 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.10 per share. This marked the 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Other cash flows from financing activities primarily include distributions to noncontrolling interests, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2009, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Warranties/Guarantees&#148; in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M&#146;s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of the Company&#146;s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments due by year \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt, including current portion (Note 10) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,619 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,521 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,080 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest on long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n2,071 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,230 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital leases (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations and other \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual cash obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,461 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,385 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,062 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,104 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,716 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,451 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nT he Company&#146;s $350 million of Dealer Remarketable Securities (classified as current portion of long-term debt) were remarketed for one year in December 2009. Long-term debt payments due in 2010 include these $350 million of Dealer Remarketable Securities, which mature in December 2010, and $146 million of floating rate notes. The floating rate notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Long-term debt payments due in 2011 include floating rate notes totaling $100 million as a result of put provisions. Additionally, payments due in 2012 include the $225 million carrying amount of Convertible Notes, as a result of put provisions that may or may not be exercised by note holders. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company&#146;s expected capital spending in 2010 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M&#146;s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled &#147;Unconditional purchase obligations and other,&#148; include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $330 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 8 for further details. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2010 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in 2010 and future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. A financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. This committee determines the Company&#146;s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. This committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nA Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the Company&#146;s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after-tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2009. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The model used analyzed 17 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. Foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreases in volatility during 2009, which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAdverse impact on \n\n&#160; \n\nPositive impact on \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nafter-tax earnings \n\n&#160; \n\nafter-tax earnings \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign exchange rates \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(81 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(108 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rates \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommodity rates \n\n&#160; \n\n(20 \n\n) \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $50 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $37 million per year. Derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure. \n\n&#160; \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company&#146;s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company&#146;s expected future business and financial performance. Words such as &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;aim,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;could&#148; and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include statements about the Company&#146;s strategy for growth, product development, market position, future performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n"}
