Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors around the world. \n\nOur strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses &#150; Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space &#38; Security (BDS) &#150; supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. \n\nConsolidated Results of Operations \n\nRevenues \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Commercial Airplanes \n\n&#160; $ 34,051 &#160; &#160; $ 28,263 &#160; &#160; $ 33,386 &#160; Boeing Defense, Space &#38; Security \n\n&#160; &#160; 33,661 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32,047 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32,052 &#160; Boeing Capital Corporation \n\n&#160; &#160; 660 &#160; &#160; &#160; 703 &#160; &#160; &#160; 815 &#160; Other segment \n\n&#160; &#160; 165 &#160; &#160; &#160; 567 &#160; &#160; &#160; 308 &#160; Unallocated items and eliminations \n\n&#160; &#160; (256 ) &#160; &#160; (671 ) &#160; &#160; (174 ) Total \n\n&#160; $ 68,281 &#160; &#160; $ 60,909 &#160; &#160; $ 66,387 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues in 2009 increased by $7,372 million due to higher revenues in Commercial Airplanes and BDS. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $5,788, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009. Deliveries in 2008 were lower as a result of a labor strike in the prior year. Increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million, primarily due to higher revenues in Global Services &#38; Support (GS&#38;S) and Boeing Military Airplanes (BMA), partially offset by decreases in Network &#38; Space Systems (N&#38;SS). BCC revenues decreased by $43 million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues decreased by $402 million partly due to higher revenues in the prior year from the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease. Lower Unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by $415 million primarily due to lower P-8A Poseidon program (P-8A) intercompany revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes in 2009 compared with 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe decrease in 2008 revenues of $5,478 million compared with 2007, is primarily due to lower revenues at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $5,123 million, primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre-strike deliveries and model mix. We delivered 104 fewer airplanes than expected during 2008 due to the strike. This reduced revenue by approximately $6.4 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. BDS revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in GS&#38;S was offset by decreases in BMA and N&#38;SS. BCC revenues decreased by $112 million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues increased by $259 million primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft during 2008, that were held under an operating lease. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $497 million, primarily due to the intercompany elimination of P-8A revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes. \n\nEarnings From Operations \n\nThe following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Commercial Airplanes \n\n&#160; &#160; (583 ) &#160; &#160; 1,186 &#160; &#160; $ 3,584 &#160; Boeing Defense, Space &#38; Security \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,299 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,232 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,440 &#160; Boeing Capital Corporation \n\n&#160; &#160; 126 &#160; &#160; &#160; 162 &#160; &#160; &#160; 234 &#160; Other segment \n\n&#160; &#160; (152 ) &#160; &#160; (307 ) &#160; &#160; (331 ) Unallocated items and eliminations \n\n&#160; &#160; (594 ) &#160; &#160; (323 ) &#160; &#160; (1,097 ) Total \n\n&#160; $ 2,096 &#160; &#160; $ 3,950 &#160; &#160; $ 5,830 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Operating earnings in 2009 decreased by $1,854 million compared with 2008. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $1,769 million primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in August 2009 that these aircraft could not be sold. The earnings decrease is also attributable to reach-forward losses on the 747 program which grew by $1,352 million in 2009 which is an increase of $667 million over 2008. Lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower 2009 earnings. These decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009 compared with 2008. BDS earnings increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment partially offset by lower earnings in the N&#38;SS segment. BCC operating earnings decreased $36 million reflecting lower revenues, higher impairment expense and a provision for losses, partially offset by lower interest expense. Other segment losses decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2009 reduced earnings by $271 million compared with 2008, which is further explained in the table below. \n\nOperating earnings in 2008 decreased by $1,880 million compared with 2007. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $2,398 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to fewer new airplane deliveries resulting from the strike, increased program infrastructure costs related to the strike and revised schedules on 787 and 747-8, and a charge taken on the 747-8 program. Commercial Airplanes&#146; research and development expense decreased by $124 million to $2,838 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower spending on 787 partially offset by higher spending on 747-8 and lower supplier development cost sharing payments. BDS earnings decreased by $208 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from charges taken on the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&#38;C). BCC operating \n\n&#160; \n\nearnings decreased $72 million reflecting lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2008 improved by $774 million compared with 2007, which is further explained in the table below. \n\nThe most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Share-based plans expense \n\n&#160; $ (189 ) &#160; $ (149 ) &#160; $ (233 ) Deferred compensation expense/(income) \n\n&#160; &#160; (158 ) &#160; &#160; 223 &#160; &#160; &#160; (51 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations \n\n&#160; &#160; (264 ) &#160; &#160; (110 ) &#160; &#160; (127 ) Pension \n\n&#160; &#160; 110 &#160; &#160; &#160; (208 ) &#160; &#160; (561 ) Postretirement \n\n&#160; &#160; (93 ) &#160; &#160; (79 ) &#160; &#160; (125 ) Total \n\n&#160; $ (594 ) &#160; $ (323 ) &#160; $ (1,097 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The reduction in Share-based plans expense in 2008 is primarily due to the expiration of certain Performance Shares during 2008 and higher expense acceleration during 2007, resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in 2008. \n\nDeferred compensation expense increased by $381 million in 2009 and decreased by $274 million in 2008. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. \n\nOther unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by $154 million in 2009 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations, elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment in the same periods of the prior year. Other unallocated items and expense in 2008 includes a charge related to satellite litigation of $100 million, offset by lower performance-based compensation in 2008. \n\nUnallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,816 million, $1,132 million and $1,773 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Pension &#160; &#160; Other Postretirement Benefits &#160; Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Allocated to business segments \n\n&#160; $ (989 ) &#160; $ (488 ) &#160; $ (521 ) &#160; $ (522 ) &#160; (428 ) &#160; (523 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations \n\n&#160; &#160; 110 &#160; &#160; &#160; (208 ) &#160; &#160; (561 ) &#160; &#160; (93 ) &#160; (79 ) &#160; (125 ) Total \n\n&#160; $ (879 ) &#160; $ (696 ) &#160; $ (1,082 ) &#160; $ (615 ) &#160; (507 ) &#160; (648 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOther Earnings Items \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Earnings from operations \n\n&#160; $ 2,096 &#160; &#160; $ 3,950 &#160; &#160; $ 5,830 &#160; Other (expense)/income, net \n\n&#160; &#160; (26 ) &#160; &#160; 247 &#160; &#160; &#160; 484 &#160; Interest and debt expense \n\n&#160; &#160; (339 ) &#160; &#160; (202 ) &#160; &#160; (196 ) Earnings before income taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,731 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,995 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,118 &#160; Income tax expense \n\n&#160; &#160; (396 ) &#160; &#160; (1,341 ) &#160; &#160; (2,060 ) Net earnings from continuing operations \n\n&#160; $ 1,335 &#160; &#160; $ 2,654 &#160; &#160; $ 4,058 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Other income decreased by $273 million and $237 million in 2009 and 2008. The decreases are primarily driven by a reduction in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances. Interest and debt expense increased by $137 million compared with 2008 due to additional debt issued in 2009. \n\nFor a discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5. \n\nBacklog \n\nOur backlog at December 31 was as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 Contractual backlog: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Commercial Airplanes \n\n&#160; $ 250,476 &#160; $ 278,575 &#160; $ 255,176 Boeing Defense, Space &#38; Security: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Boeing Military Aircraft \n\n&#160; &#160; 26,311 &#160; &#160; 25,710 &#160; &#160; 22,974 Network &#38; Space Systems \n\n&#160; &#160; 7,746 &#160; &#160; 8,868 &#160; &#160; 9,207 Global Services &#38; Support \n\n&#160; &#160; 11,967 &#160; &#160; 10,707 &#160; &#160; 9,607 Total Boeing Defense, Space &#38; Security \n\n&#160; &#160; 46,024 &#160; &#160; 45,285 &#160; &#160; 41,788 Total contractual backlog \n\n&#160; $ 296,500 &#160; $ 323,860 &#160; $ 296,964 Unobligated backlog \n\n&#160; $ 19,058 &#160; $ 28,066 &#160; $ 30,173 &#160; ##TABLE_END Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. The increase in backlog during 2008 was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737, 767, 777 and 787 programs. \n\nUnobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding have not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2009 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $8,904 million compared with 2008 partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) (formerly the Future Combat Systems (FCS)) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Approved funding of existing multi-year contracts including the BCTM, V-22, Chinook, Proprietary and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) programs also reduced unobligated backlog. The decrease in Unobligated backlog during 2008 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $2,174 million compared with 2007 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the F/A-18, BCTM and F-22 programs. These decreases were partially offset by multi-year procurement contracts awarded on the V-22 and Chinook programs. \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Results of Operations and Financial Condition \n\nCommercial Airplanes \n\nBusiness Environment and Trends \n\nAirline Industry Environment 2008 and 2009 were extremely challenging for the world&#146;s airlines as key external business factors (oil prices, economic growth, exchange rates, financing terms) experienced high levels of volatility. In the first half of 2008, airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to $150/barrel. In autumn 2008, the airlines&#146; focus shifted to the fallout of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below $40/barrel for the first time since 2004, and in 2009 passenger and cargo traffic experienced their worst ever declines. This business environment curtailed the airline industry profit recovery that started in 2006. As a result, the global airline industry has now reported losses in seven out of the last ten years, and over 30 airlines have entered bankruptcy since the beginning of 2008. \n\nIn this challenging environment, airlines are adapting their operations to meet the realities of the markets in which they operate. Airlines reduced global passenger capacity by 2% in 2009 through a combination of frequency and route cuts in unprofitable markets, lower daily airplane utilization (flight hours per day) and parking/scrapping of older generation airplanes. Airlines are also replacing older less fuel efficient airplanes, reducing non-fuel costs and finding new ways to partner through alliances or via mergers and acquisitions. \n\nThese conditions have caused customers to request cancellations, modifications, or rescheduling of their existing orders and advance payment schedules to meet revised fleet plans or address financing and cash flow issues. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled, modified, or rescheduled. \n\nNear-term global airline industry indicators are improving although many uncertainties persist. Global economic recovery has begun. Although it is expected to vary significantly by region both in terms of speed and magnitude, world economic growth is forecast to grow moderately in 2010 following contraction in 2009. As a result, airline industry forecasts generally indicate global passenger traffic returning close to 2008 levels in 2010 with many emerging markets posting growth over 2009. Air cargo traffic is forecast to grow above the long-term trend rates in 2010 following two years of contraction which have taken traffic back to 2002 and 2003 levels. Due to these improving demand conditions, airlines are expected to see significantly smaller financial losses globally in 2010. \n\nBeyond the near-term market uncertainties, the long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.2 trillion market for 29,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. \n\nThe industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian or H1N1 flus), terrorism and increased global environmental regulations. \n\nIndustry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. \n\nContinued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes&#146; contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. \n\nWe face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. \n\nWorldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in the second half of 2009 puts pressure on competitors&#146; revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens again, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. \n\nWe are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. \n\nOperating Results \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 34,051 &#160; &#160; $ 28,263 &#160; &#160; $ 33,386 &#160; % of Total company revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 50 % &#160; &#160; 46 % &#160; &#160; 50 % (Loss)/earnings from operations \n\n&#160; $ (583 ) &#160; $ 1,186 &#160; &#160; $ 3,584 &#160; Operating margins \n\n&#160; &#160; -1.7 % &#160; &#160; 4.2 % &#160; &#160; 10.7 % Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 5,383 &#160; &#160; $ 2,838 &#160; &#160; $ 2,962 &#160; Contractual backlog \n\n&#160; $ 250,476 &#160; &#160; $ 278,575 &#160; &#160; $ 255,176 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nYear-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; 2009 vs. 2008 &#160; &#160; 2008 vs. 2007 &#160; New airplane sales \n\n&#160; $ 6,129 &#160; &#160; $ (4,876 ) Aircraft trading \n\n&#160; &#160; (33 ) &#160; &#160; (264 ) Commercial aviation services business \n\n&#160; &#160; (308 ) &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 5,788 &#160; &#160; $ (5,123 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The increase in revenue of $5,788 million in 2009 from 2008 is primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues. Prior year revenues were negatively impacted by the 2008 IAM strike. The decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions. \n\nThe decrease in revenue of $5,123 million in 2008 from 2007 is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries. The IAM strike resulted in 104 airplane deliveries moving out of 2008 which reduced 2008 revenues by $6,406 million. The strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of $804 million, and higher pre-strike deliveries, net of model mix changes, of $726 million. Aircraft trading activity decreased by $264 million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft. Revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by $17 million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions. \n\nCommercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; 737 &#160; &#160; 747 &#160; 767 &#160; &#160; 777 &#160; Total 2009 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cumulative Deliveries \n\n&#160; 3,128 &#160; &#160; 1,418 &#160; 982 &#160; &#160; 836 &#160; Deliveries \n\n&#160; 372 * &#160; 8 &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 88 &#160; 481 2008 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cumulative Deliveries \n\n&#160; 2,756 &#160; &#160; 1,410 &#160; 969 &#160; &#160; 748 &#160; Deliveries \n\n&#160; 290 * &#160; 14 &#160; 10 * &#160; 61 &#160; 375 2007 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cumulative Deliveries \n\n&#160; 2,466 &#160; &#160; 1,396 &#160; 959 &#160; &#160; 687 &#160; Deliveries \n\n&#160; 330 * &#160; 16 &#160; 12 * &#160; 83 &#160; 441 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START * Intercompany deliveries included five 737 aircraft in 2009, two 767 aircraft and two 737 aircraft in 2008 and one 767 aircraft and one 737 aircraft in 2007. ##TABLE_END Earnings From Operations \n\nEarnings from operations for 2009 decreased by $1,769 million when compared to 2008, primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $2,481 million related to the three 787 flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory as of July 31, 2009. Additional production costs incurred between August and December 2009 of $212 million related to those flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. Those amounts were partially offset by a $148 million decrease in other research and development expense. The decrease in earnings is also attributable to reach-forward losses on the 747 program which grew by $1,352 million in 2009 compared with losses of $685 million in 2008. The 2009 reach-forward losses were primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. Lower commercial aviation services \n\n&#160; \n\nrevenues and margins reduced earnings by $245 million. Higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays announced in 2008 and 2009 and infrastructure costs incurred during the 2008 IAM strike reduced earnings by $199 million. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $47 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of $1,934 million related to new airplane deliveries. \n\nEarnings from operations decreased by $2,398 million in 2008 when compared to 2007, with operating margins decreasing 6.5 percentage points to 4.2%. Lower new airplane deliveries, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues, reduced earnings by $1,400 million. A charge for a reach-forward loss on the 747 program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of 747-8 derivatives reduced 2008 earnings by $685 million. Infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike reduced earnings by $287 million. The 787 and 747-8 schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on 2008 deliveries, while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $108 million. A reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix-related earnings of $42 million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs. Lower research and development costs improved earnings by $124 million. \n\nBacklog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. \n\nThe decrease in contractual backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. The increase in backlog during 2008 was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737, 767, 777 and 787 programs. \n\nAccounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program&#146;s life. Estimation of each program&#146;s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. \n\nCommercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which does not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates. This has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Program &#160; &#160; &#160; 737 &#160; 747 &#160; 767 &#160; 777 &#160; 787 2009 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Program accounting quantities \n\n&#160; 4,600 &#160; 1,499 &#160; 1,035 &#160; 1,100 &#160; * Undelivered units under firm orders \n\n&#160; 2,076 &#160; 108 &#160; 59 &#160; 281 &#160; 851 Cumulative firm orders 2 \n\n&#160; 5,204 &#160; 1,526 &#160; 1,041 &#160; 1,117 &#160; &#160; 2008 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Program accounting quantities \n\n&#160; 4,200 &#160; 1,499 &#160; 1,023 &#160; 1,050 &#160; * Undelivered units under firm orders 1 \n\n&#160; 2,270 &#160; 114 &#160; 70 &#160; 350 &#160; 910 Cumulative firm orders 2 \n\n&#160; 5,026 &#160; 1,524 &#160; 1,039 &#160; 1,098 &#160; &#160; 2007 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Program accounting quantities \n\n&#160; 3,800 &#160; 1,474 &#160; 998 &#160; 950 &#160; * Undelivered units under firm orders \n\n&#160; 2,076 &#160; 125 &#160; 52 &#160; 357 &#160; 817 Cumulative firm orders 2 \n\n&#160; 4,542 &#160; 1,521 &#160; 1,011 &#160; 1,044 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START * &#160; The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1 &#160; Undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to December 31, 2008. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2 &#160; Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. \n\n##TABLE_END 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2009 due to the program&#146;s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. Production rates remained unchanged in 2009. \n\n747 Program There was no change in the accounting quantity for the 747 program during 2009. \n\nIn 2008, we recorded a charge of $685 million to recognize a reach-forward loss. The charge was primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers. \n\nDuring 2009, additional charges of $1,352 million were recorded to recognize reach-forward losses. During the first quarter of 2009, we recorded $347 million of a reach-forward loss due to a reduction in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and an increase in estimated costs due to our decisions to reduce twin-aisle production rates which impact production rates beginning in 2010. During the third quarter of 2009 we increased the reach-forward loss on the 747 program by $1,005 million. Of this amount, $643 million was caused by higher estimated production costs, including both additional internal production costs and higher supplier expenses, attributable to greater than expected re-work and disruption in manufacturing due to late maturity of engineering designs as well as the limited availability of engineering resources. The remaining $362 million was primarily due to challenging cargo market conditions and our related decision to defer a planned increase in the 747-8 production rate, which drove higher allocations of fixed costs and caused us to incur volume-based penalties to suppliers. \n\nFirst flight of the 747-8 Freighter is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2010, with the flight test program expected to take place in 2010. First delivery of the 747-8 Freighter is expected in the fourth \n\n&#160; \n\nquarter of 2010. First delivery of the Intercontinental passenger variant remains scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2011. The gap between the delivery of the last 747-400, which occurred in 2009, and first deliveries of the 747-8 will result in lower 747 program revenues. \n\n767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2009. In April 2009, we announced a delay in previous plans to increase the production rate. \n\n777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2009. Delivery of the first 777 Freighter occurred in February 2009. In April 2009, we announced that we will lower the production rate on our 777 airplane program, affecting deliveries beginning in June 2010. This lower production rate will decrease revenues and earnings in 2010 and 2011. \n\n787 Program We announced on June 23, 2009 the necessity to reinforce an area of structure at the side-of-body section of the airplane. During the fourth quarter, we completed the modifications on the first two flight-test airplanes and the full-scale static test airplane. First flight of the 787 occurred on December 15, 2009. A second 787 completed its first test flight on December 22, 2009. Six aircraft in total will be involved in the flight test program, which is expected to result in certification of the 787-8 in the fourth quarter of 2010. First delivery is also expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to work toward our planned increases in 787 production rates as well as the timely introduction of the 787-9 derivative. \n\nDuring 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs of $2,481 million previously recorded as program inventory as of July 31, 2009 were reclassified to research and development expense. Additional production costs incurred between August and December 2009 of $212 million related to these flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. We will continue to incur research and development costs on these flight test aircraft in 2010. We believe that the other three additional 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at December 31, 2009. If we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold we may incur additional charges. \n\nOn July 30, 2009, we acquired the business, assets and operations of Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.&#146;s (Vought) 787 business conducted at North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility produces aft fuselage sections, including the fabrication, assembly and systems installation. See Note 2. On December 22, 2009, we acquired Alenia North America&#146;s 50% ownership interest in Global Aeronautica. As a result of the transaction, we are the sole owner of this entity. Located adjacent to Boeing Charleston, Global Aeronautica is an integrator of the 787 mid-fuselage sections. \n\nOn October 28, 2009 we announced the North Charleston facility as the location for a second final assembly site for the 787 Dreamliner program. A groundbreaking ceremony was held November 20, 2009 to mark the start of construction. Until the additional 787 assembly line is fully operational, we will establish transitional surge capability at our Everett, Washington, location to facilitate the planned introduction of the 787-9, the first derivative model of the 787 family. When the additional line in North Charleston is fully operational, the surge capability in Everett will be phased out. \n\nLooking beyond first flight, we continue to monitor and address other areas of challenge associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. Efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes including delivery delays and supplier assertions. A number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and/or performance. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth. \n\nThe cumulative impacts of the flight test delays, production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts create significant pressure on program revenue and cost estimates. We continue to assess our mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to address these pressures. \n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. \n\nResearch and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. \n\nOur Research and development expense increased by $2,545 million in 2009. This was due to reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft and $50 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments, partially offset by a $198 million decrease of other research and development expense. \n\nOur Research and development expense decreased $124 million in 2008. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The decrease in research and development spending for 2008 was primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities partially offset by $278 million of increased spending on the 747-8 program and $80 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. \n\nAdditional Considerations \n\nThe 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, particularly as both the 747-8 and the 787 begin the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase \n\n&#160; \n\nagreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs and schedule for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. \n\nBoeing Defense, Space &#38; Security \n\nBusiness Environment and Trends \n\nOn January 7, 2010, we announced that Integrated Defense Systems will begin operating under the name Boeing Defense, Space &#38; Security (BDS). \n\nBDS consists of three capabilities-driven businesses: Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), Network &#38; Space Systems (N&#38;SS) and Global Services &#38; Support (GS&#38;S). Additionally, BDS Phantom Works supports all three businesses via product development, rapid prototyping and customer engagement through experimentation and enterprise technology investment strategies. \n\nDefense Environment Overview The U.S. continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important capabilities and transform the force to meet the changing national security as articulated in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis and healthcare reform. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment. \n\nGovernment policies are impacting the defense environment including defense acquisition reform, more insourcing, concerns over industrial base, a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances. \n\nAlthough the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we expect the total budget growth rate to level off over the next several years due to shifting priorities and budget pressures. The fiscal year 2010 discretionary budget request of $660 billion includes an Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget of $130 billion, with an additional $33 billion requested. \n\nThe fiscal year 2011 discretionary budget of $708 billion includes OCO budget of $159 billion. Procurement is expected to increase, while Research and Development accounts decrease, facing increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from Operations and Maintenance (O&#38;M) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by \n\n&#160; \n\nequipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. The near-term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2011 to 2015 period for investment efforts. Though opportunities may exist following U.S. troop draw-downs in Iraq, they are offset by recent increases in Afghanistan. We continue to see pressure to reduce OCO requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars. \n\nIt is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition reform and emphasizing utilization of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cyber security, and precision-guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, electronic warfare, as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. \n\nOther nations continue to experience growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements, aging inventories, and changing threat environments. Greater U.S. reliance on allies and coalition partners places additional pressure on nations to emphasize acquisition of material that is deployable, survivable, and interoperable with the international community. European nations are struggling to meet defense investment needs as budget deficits create greater pressure on resources. Though regional financial concerns exist, Middle Eastern military markets remain robust with stable oil prices and persistent regional security concerns sustaining continued defense investment. In Asia, growth is slowing with nations pursuing select acquisitions to address growing regional threats. The international market will continue to be affected by global economic challenges. However, the continuing threat environment should keep demand stable in 2010. \n\nMissile Defense Environment The proliferation of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles is considered the greatest current threat to security and is driving missile defense spending. As a result, the near-term focus for growth is in regional and tactical BMD systems. \n\nCivil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budget is focused on technology development and demonstration programs, the International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with space exploration. NASA is developing new approaches to space exploration with added emphasis on commercial spaceflight systems, space technology development and robotic missions. NASA is also enhancing its focus on climate change and aeronautics research. \n\nHomeland Security Environment The continuing threat from terrorism is the key driver for the homeland security market. Key growth areas include aviation security, border security, maritime security and cyber security. Additionally, the U.S. government is focused on increasing cooperation with state and local institutions. \n\nCommercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market is experiencing improvement in market demand, partly driven by strong U.S. government demand for commercial satellite systems and services, but the overall sector continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing. \n\nAdjacent Market Environment We see growth opportunities across a number of adjacent markets with both U.S. DoD and other U.S. government customers. These markets, including services, unmanned systems, intelligence, cyber, and energy, represent key development areas which support the current engagements overseas as well as emerging national security issues. \n\n&#160; \n\nServices Growth in services is anticipated both domestically and internationally, as customers have a wide variety of needs, including information services, platform-related services, facility management, infrastructure services and logistics command and control. \n\nUnmanned Systems The unmanned market continues to see growth in all classes of platforms due to the high demand from the U.S. military in Southwest Asia. We anticipate this growth increasing as unmanned systems continue to provide critical mission functions to the war fighter with affordability, persistence, and accuracy. \n\nIntelligence We see the intelligence market growing based on the demands of data collection, dissemination, and analysis driven by the conflicts in Southwest Asia. Growth in data fusion, data management, and information sharing is expected as the use of ISR assets increase. \n\nCyber The demand for defensive, offensive, and exploit operations in the emerging cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers. Cyber threats from both state and non-state actors represent a critical national security issue. The U.S. government is taking significant steps to mitigate the cyber threat to the U.S. DoD and to U.S. critical infrastructure. \n\nEnergy We anticipate the energy market will emerge with growth potential. As energy volatility becomes more substantial, the need for energy management, infrastructure security, and scenario modeling will increase accordingly. The U.S. DoD, including individual service branches, is also actively engaged in developing energy policy guidance and comprehensive plans from which to execute programs. \n\nBDS Realignment \n\nEffective January 1, 2009, 2008 and 2007 certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. In addition, effective January 1, 2008, certain environmental remediation contracts (formerly included in N&#38;SS) were transferred to the Other Segment. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21. \n\nOperating Results \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 33,661 &#160; &#160; $ 32,047 &#160; &#160; $ 32,052 &#160; % of Total company revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 49 % &#160; &#160; 53 % &#160; &#160; 48 % Earnings from operations \n\n&#160; $ 3,299 &#160; &#160; $ 3,232 &#160; &#160; $ 3,440 &#160; Operating margins \n\n&#160; &#160; 9.8 % &#160; &#160; 10.1 % &#160; &#160; 10.7 % Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 1,101 &#160; &#160; $ 933 &#160; &#160; $ 848 &#160; Contractual backlog \n\n&#160; $ 46,024 &#160; &#160; $ 45,285 &#160; &#160; $ 41,788 &#160; Unobligated backlog \n\n&#160; $ 18,815 &#160; &#160; $ 27,719 &#160; &#160; $ 29,893 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to higher revenues in GS&#38;S and BMA, partially offset by decreases in N&#38;SS. BDS revenues were unchanged in 2008 compared to 2007 as revenue growth in GS&#38;S was offset by decreases in BMA and N&#38;SS. \n\nOperating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2009 increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment, partially offset by lower earnings in the N&#38;SS segment. BDS earnings decreased by $208 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the AEW&#38;C program in the second quarter partially offset by higher earnings in the N&#38;SS segment. \n\nBacklog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog decreased 11% in 2009, from $73,004 million to $64,839 million, partly due to a partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years also contributed to the backlog reduction. \n\nFor further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. \n\nAdditional Considerations \n\nOur business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, EA-18G, Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T), BCTM (formerly FCS), GMD, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), P-8A and Proprietary programs. \n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&#38;C, International KC-767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. \n\n&#160; \n\nBoeing Military Aircraft \n\nOperating Results \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 14,057 &#160; &#160; $ 13,311 &#160; &#160; $ 13,499 &#160; % of Total company revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 20 % &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; &#160; 20 % Earnings from operations \n\n&#160; $ 1,513 &#160; &#160; $ 1,277 &#160; &#160; $ 1,607 &#160; Operating margins \n\n&#160; &#160; 10.8 % &#160; &#160; 9.6 % &#160; &#160; 11.9 % Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 541 &#160; &#160; $ 479 &#160; &#160; $ 445 &#160; Contractual backlog \n\n&#160; $ 26,311 &#160; &#160; $ 25,710 &#160; &#160; $ 22,974 &#160; Unobligated backlog \n\n&#160; $ 9,322 &#160; &#160; $ 10,048 &#160; &#160; $ 8,587 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues BMA revenues increased 6% in 2009 and decreased 1% in 2008. The increase of $746 million in 2009 was primarily due to higher deliveries and volume on the Apache, V-22 and Chinook rotorcraft programs and the F-18 and Proprietary programs, partly offset by lower volume on the F-22 and several weapons programs. The decrease of $188 million in 2008 is primarily driven by lower F-22, Apache, F-18 and Chinook revenue partially offset by increased deliveries on F-15 and International KC-767 Tanker and C-17 contract mix. \n\nDeliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 F/A-18 Models \n\n&#160; 49 &#160; 45 &#160; 44 F-15E Eagle \n\n&#160; 13 &#160; 14 &#160; 12 C-17 Globemaster \n\n&#160; 16 &#160; 16 &#160; 16 International KC-767 Tanker \n\n&#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; CH-47 Chinook \n\n&#160; 11 &#160; 12 &#160; 10 T-45TS Goshawk \n\n&#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; 9 AH-64 Apache \n\n&#160; 23 &#160; 3 &#160; 17 C-40A Clipper \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 Total new-build production aircraft \n\n&#160; 121 &#160; 99 &#160; 111 &#160; ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings increased by $236 million in 2009 partly due to higher deliveries on several programs and volume, partially offset by a change in delivery mix. Operating earnings in both years were negatively impacted by charges on the AEW&#38;C and International KC-767 Tanker programs. BMA earnings decreased by $330 million in 2008 primarily due to charges taken on the AEW&#38;C program. Delivery mix and lower volume also contributed to the decrease in 2008. \n\nResearch and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter&#146;s enduring needs. Research and development expense in 2009 increased by 13% over 2008 primarily due to proprietary programs which was partially offset by lower international tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers&#146; capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. Investments in prototyping allow us to offer low-risk programs to our customers. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in \n\n&#160; \n\nareas like autonomous operation of unmanned vehicles, advanced sensors and Electronic Warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. \n\nBacklog BMA total backlog in 2009 was virtually unchanged from 2008. Backlog increases due to 2009 current year orders for C-17, P-8 India and Chinook aircraft were offset by revenues recognized on multi-year contracts received in prior years with the largest decrease in the F/A-18 program. Total backlog increased by 13% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in the V-22, Chinook and F-15 program backlog. These increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the C-17 and F/A-18 programs. \n\nAdditional Considerations \n\nItems which could have a future impact on BMA operations include the following: \n\nAEW&#38;C During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEW&#38;C programs in Australia and Turkey by $133 million, $308 million and $81 million, respectively. The 2009 charge primarily related to delivery schedule delays. The 2008 charge, primarily related to our program in Australia, was due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing. The AEW&#38;C development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. During the fourth quarter of 2009, two Wedgetail aircraft were provided to Australia for familiarization and training. Wedgetail final delivery and customer acceptance is scheduled to begin in late 2010 and extend through the second quarter of 2011. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. \n\nInternational KC-767 Tanker Program During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses in the International KC-767 Tanker programs by $78 million, $85 million and $152 million, respectively. The 2007 charge was partially offset at the consolidated level. The International KC-767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. The final delivery to Japan was made in December 2009. The Italian International KC-767 program is ongoing, and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. \n\nC-17 See the discussion of C-17 in Note 11 Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies. \n\n&#160; \n\nNetwork &#38; Space Systems \n\nOperating Results \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 10,877 &#160; &#160; $ 11,346 &#160; &#160; $ 11,481 &#160; % of Total company revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; &#160; 17 % Earnings from operations \n\n&#160; $ 839 &#160; &#160; $ 1,034 &#160; &#160; $ 863 &#160; Operating margins \n\n&#160; &#160; 7.7 % &#160; &#160; 9.1 % &#160; &#160; 7.5 % Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 397 &#160; &#160; $ 298 &#160; &#160; $ 289 &#160; Contractual backlog \n\n&#160; $ 7,746 &#160; &#160; $ 8,868 &#160; &#160; $ 9,207 &#160; Unobligated backlog \n\n&#160; $ 9,187 &#160; &#160; $ 16,981 &#160; &#160; $ 20,134 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues N&#38;SS revenues decreased 4% in 2009 and 1% in 2008. N&#38;SS revenues are expected to decrease in 2010, primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM and GMD programs. The decrease of $469 million in 2009 is primarily due to lower volume on the GMD, Intelligence and Security Systems, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by higher volume on several satellite programs. The decrease of $135 million in 2008 is primarily due to decreased revenues in BCTM (formerly FCS), Proprietary and satellite programs partially offset by increased revenues in the SBInet program. \n\nDelta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 Delta II Commercial \n\n&#160; 1 &#160; 2 &#160; 3 Delta IV Commercial \n\n&#160; 1 &#160; &#160; Satellites \n\n&#160; 6 &#160; 1 &#160; 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END Operating Earnings N&#38;SS operating earnings decreased by $195 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues and charges related to the Sea Launch bankruptcy. Earnings in 2009 were also reduced by charges related to the settlement of a satellite contract dispute and indemnification of Delta II inventory. Earnings in 2008 included a favorable settlement on a civil satellite program. N&#38;SS earnings increased by $171 million in 2008 primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA). N&#38;SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $164 million, $178 million and $74 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. \n\nResearch and Development The N&#38;SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications, command and control, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems (C4ISR); that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Key programs in this area include BCTM, JTRS, Wideband Global Satellite System Ares, FAB-T and SBInet. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. \n\nBacklog N&#38;SS total backlog decreased by 34% in 2009 compared with 2008 partly due to the partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract related to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years including BCTM, \n\n&#160; \n\nGMD, and Proprietary programs also contributed to the backlog reduction. Total backlog decreased by 12% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year orders received in prior years on BCTM, GMD and C3 programs, partially offset by an increase in the International Space Station program. \n\nAdditional Considerations \n\nItems which could have a future impact on N&#38;SS operations include the following: \n\nUnited Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) created a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. We initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeded our proportionate share of ULA&#146;s net assets. This difference is expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 15 years. \n\nIn connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements during the 5 year period following December 1, 2006. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $122 million of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. \n\nWe agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,111 million of inventories that were contributed by us and has made payments of $120 million to us under the inventory supply agreement. As part of its integration, ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, earnings could be reduced by up to $62 million. \n\nWe agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two of the four satellite missions covered by the indemnification. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. ULA intends to submit a claim to the USAF in 2010 to re-price the contract value of the third mission. If ULA is unsuccessful obtaining additional pricing we may be responsible for some of the shortfall and may record up to $382 million in pre-tax losses associated with the four missions. \n\nBusiness Environment and Trends During 2009, we received a partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. We believe the final restructured BCTM contract will negatively impact revenue and earnings in the N&#38;SS segment going forward. In addition, we completed the TSAT risk reduction and system definition contract in July 2009 and do not anticipate a future TSAT space segment program competition. As a result of lower than anticipated revenue and earnings, we tested N&#38;SS goodwill for impairment during 2009. No \n\n&#160; \n\nimpairment was indicated by our tests. Future recommended budgetary changes, if approved by Congress, or additional partial terminations, could further impact N&#38;SS programs, including the recoverability of goodwill. \n\nSea Launch See the discussion of Sea Launch Chapter 11 Filing and outstanding accounts receivable in Note 6 Accounts Receivable. \n\nSatellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc.

The 2009 increase was due to increased volume in the Integrated Logistics (IL), and the Training Systems and Services (TS&#38;S) divisions. The 2008 increase was due to higher revenues in the TS&#38;S and IL divisions partially offset by decreases in International Support program volume. \n\nOperating Earnings GS&#38;S Operating earnings increased 3% in 2009 as additional earnings from increased volume were partially offset by lower margins due to contract adjustments and changes in contract mix. Operating earnings decreased by 5% in 2008 due to changes in the contract mix and disposition of contract matters. \n\nResearch and Development GS&#38;S continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, Maintenance Modifications and Upgrades (MM&#38;U) and TS&#38;S, as well as on moving into new market areas of Logistics Command and Control (Log C2) and Energy Management in Advanced Global Services and Support. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, the F-15 Singapore Performance-Based Logistics contract, and Smart Grid Projects. Successful development of adaptable systems has allowed GS&#38;S to transition from Boeing platforms and into the broader aviation market. Beyond aerospace, GS&#38;S capabilities have created opportunities in adjacencies and new markets exemplified in 2009 through entrance into the Land Vehicle support, Energy Solutions, and Logistics Information Systems markets. \n\nBacklog GS&#38;S total backlog increased by 8% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to significant growth in International Support and Defense and Government Services programs and partially offset by decreases in the IL and MM&#38;U divisions. Total backlog increased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to increases in IL and International Support programs. \n\n&#160; \n\nBoeing Capital Corporation \n\nBusiness Environment and Trends \n\nBCC&#146;s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 totaled $5,666 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of BCC&#146;s portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. \n\nThe weak global economic environment and capital market disruptions affected the availability of credit for the airline industry. While sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries improved during 2009, BCC provided limited financing to certain Boeing customers. To the extent capital market conditions continue to improve, we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for BCC to provide financing. \n\nAircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,400 western-built commercial jet aircraft (11.6% of current world fleet) were parked as of December 2009, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Over 36% of the parked aircraft are not expected to return to service. In December 2008 and 2007, 11.0% and 8.2% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. \n\nSummary Financial Information \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 660 &#160; &#160; $ 703 &#160; &#160; $ 815 &#160; Earnings from operations \n\n&#160; $ 126 &#160; &#160; $ 162 &#160; &#160; $ 234 &#160; Operating margins \n\n&#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 23 % &#160; &#160; 29 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nBCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC&#146;s revenues decreased $43 million in 2009, resulting from lower operating lease income resulting from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and asset dispositions. BCC&#146;s revenues decreased $112 million in 2008, primarily due to lower interest income on notes receivable and lower investment income. \n\nEarnings From Operations \n\nBCC&#146;s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $36 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues, higher impairment expense and a provision for losses primarily due to declines in aircraft collateral values and reduced projected cash flows for certain aircraft. The decrease in operating earnings in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to lower revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Position \n\nThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31,: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio \n\n&#160; $ 5,666 &#160; &#160; $ 6,023 &#160; Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.5 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.1 % Debt \n\n&#160; $ 4,075 &#160; &#160; $ 3,652 &#160; Debt-to-Equity Ratio \n\n&#160; &#160; 5.8-to-1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.0-to-1 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END BCC&#146;s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 decreased from December 31, 2008 due to normal portfolio run-off partially offset by new business volume. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, BCC had $385 million and $685 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $345 million and $305 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. In March 2009, Mexicana Group committed to lease 25 717 aircraft, including 13 that were placed on lease and 12 that were held for sale or re-lease at December 31, 2009. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $171 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2010. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $15 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts at December 31, 2009. \n\nBCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. \n\nRestructurings and Restructuring Requests \n\nFrom time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2009, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. \n\nOther Segment \n\n(Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; $ 165 &#160; &#160; $ 567 &#160; &#160; $ 308 &#160; Loss from operations \n\n&#160; $ (152 ) &#160; $ (307 ) &#160; $ (331 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Effective January 1, 2008, certain intercompany items were realigned between the Other segment and Unallocated expense. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $402 million compared with 2008 primarily due to the sale of three C-17 aircraft in 2008 held under operating lease. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. During 2009, Other segment recognized $76 million in lower charges relating to environmental remediation than in 2008. \n\nOther segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $259 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease, three of which were sold in 2008. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $24 million compared with 2007 primarily due to $50 million in lower environmental and certain other charges offset by the recognition of a provision for losses of $82 million related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. The provision for losses amount has been recorded in the Other segment as a result of intercompany guarantees we provide to BCC. \n\n&#160; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Years ended December 31, &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2007 &#160; Net earnings \n\n&#160; $ 1,312 &#160; &#160; $ 2,672 &#160; &#160; $ 4,074 &#160; Non-cash items \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,381 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,829 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,753 &#160; Changes in working capital \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,910 &#160; &#160; &#160; (4,902 ) &#160; &#160; 3,757 &#160; Net cash provided/(used) by operating activities \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,603 &#160; &#160; &#160; (401 ) &#160; &#160; 9,584 &#160; Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; (3,794 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,888 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3,822 ) Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,094 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5,202 ) &#160; &#160; (4,884 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; &#160; 44 &#160; &#160; &#160; (59 ) &#160; &#160; 46 &#160; Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,947 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3,774 ) &#160; &#160; 924 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,268 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,042 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,118 &#160; Cash and cash equivalents at end of year \n\n&#160; $ 9,215 &#160; &#160; $ 3,268 &#160; &#160; $ 7,042 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6,004 million to $5,603 million during 2009 compared with 2008. The improvement reflects a reduction in working capital due to the inventory that was built up during the 2008 IAM strike which was delivered in 2009, offset by the continued ramp up of the 787 program during 2009. We expect operating cash flows to be lower in 2010 as we continue to build inventories prior to deliveries of the 787 and 747-8 airplanes. We contributed 29,211,295 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $1.5 billion to our pension plans in November 2009. Cash contributions to our pension plans totaled $82 million and $531 million in 2009 and 2008. \n\nInvesting Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $3,794 million during 2009 compared with $1,888 million provided during 2008. The $5,682 million year-over-year change is primarily due to changes in investments in time deposits and debt securities. In 2008 we received net proceeds of $4,670 million from liquidating investments. In 2009, we made net contributions of $1,588 million to investments. In 2009, other investing outlays included $639 million for acquisitions and $448 million to satisfy guarantees of Sea Launch indebtedness, which was partially offset by a $40 million reimbursement. These cash outlays were partly offset by $488 million of lower capital spending on property, plant and equipment additions in 2009 compared with 2008. We expect capital spending in 2010 to be higher than 2009 due to the construction of a second 787 final assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina. \n\nFinancing Activities Cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,094 million during 2009 compared with $5,202 million used during 2008, primarily due to proceeds from borrowings of $5,961 million in 2009 and reductions in share repurchases in 2009. \n\nOn March 13, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,850 million, on July 28, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,950 million, and on November 20, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,200 million. On October 27, 2009, BCC issued notes totaling $1,000 million. \n\nIn 2009, we repaid $551 million of debt, including $528 million of debt held at BCC. In 2008, we repaid $738 million of debt, including $709 million of debt held at BCC. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. There were no material debt issuances during 2008 or 2007. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded balance of debt was $12,924 million and $7,512 million, of which $707 million and $560 million were classified as short-term. This includes $4,075 million and $3,652 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $659 million and $528 million was classified as short-term. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring 2009, we repurchased 1,173,152 shares at an average price of $42.94 in our open market share repurchase program and 477,176 shares transferred to us from employees in satisfaction of minimum tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock during the period. During 2008, we repurchased 42,073,885 shares at an average price of $69.79 in our open market share repurchase program, 1,462,776 shares at an average price of $64.95 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 74,824 shares in stock swaps. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. Share repurchase activity is expected to remain at a minimal level in 2010. \n\nCredit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Fitch &#160; Moody&#146;s &#160; Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s Long-term: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Boeing/BCC \n\n&#160; A+ &#160; A2 &#160; A Outlook \n\n&#160; Negative &#160; Negative &#160; Stable Short-term: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Boeing/BCC \n\n&#160; F1 &#160; P-1 &#160; A-1 &#160; ##TABLE_END On April 30, 2009, Fitch Ratings affirmed Boeing&#146;s and BCC&#146;s A+ credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative. On July 29, 2009, Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s lowered Boeing&#146;s and BCC&#146;s long-term ratings from A+ to A. On October 14, 2009, Moody&#146;s affirmed Boeing&#146;s and BCC&#146;s A2 and P-1 ratings, but changed its outlook from neutral to negative. \n\nCapital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2009 and at December 31, 2009, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $3,525 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements, of which $2,000 million is a 5-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $1,525 million is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2010. Both the 5-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. In 2009, we renewed the 364-day revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is allocated to BCC. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in 2010. On March 9, 2009, we filed a public shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and common stock. \n\nIn the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. At this point in time, our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by capital market conditions. \n\nOn November 9, 2009, we made pension contributions in the form of 29,211,295 shares of our common stock. The contributed shares had an aggregate value of $1.5 billion, as of the contribution \n\n&#160; \n\ndate. The share contribution did not affect cash balances. In addition, we made cash contributions of $82 million during 2009. In 2010, we will begin matching employee contributions to the company-sponsored 401(k) plan with common stock instead of cash for nonunion employees. \n\nAt December 31, 2009 and 2008 our pension plans were $6,356 million and $8,420 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. In 2010, required contributions to our pension plans are not expected to exceed $100 million. \n\nAs of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2009, and the estimated timing thereof. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 year &#160; 1-3 years &#160; 3-5 years &#160; After 5 years Long-term debt (including current portion) \n\n&#160; $ 12,846 &#160; $ 680 &#160; $ 2,815 &#160; $ 2,547 &#160; $ 6,804 Interest on debt* \n\n&#160; &#160; 7,981 &#160; &#160; 664 &#160; &#160; 1,204 &#160; &#160; 934 &#160; &#160; 5,179 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements \n\n&#160; &#160; 22,038 &#160; &#160; 634 &#160; &#160; 1,484 &#160; &#160; 5,304 &#160; &#160; 14,616 Capital lease obligations \n\n&#160; &#160; 76 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; 12 Operating lease obligations \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,158 &#160; &#160; 213 &#160; &#160; 300 &#160; &#160; 188 &#160; &#160; 457 Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position \n\n&#160; &#160; 100,496 &#160; &#160; 35,387 &#160; &#160; 29,070 &#160; &#160; 20,821 &#160; &#160; 15,218 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position \n\n&#160; &#160; 11,793 &#160; &#160; 10,893 &#160; &#160; 765 &#160; &#160; 131 &#160; &#160; 4 Total contractual obligations \n\n&#160; $ 156,388 &#160; $ 48,485 &#160; $ 35,666 &#160; $ 29,947 &#160; $ 42,290 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2009. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2009. ##TABLE_END Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. \n\nPurchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 9% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. \n\nPurchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, \n\n&#160; \n\nproperty, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. \n\nPurchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. \n\nIndustrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2009, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2009, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $11 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. \n\nIncome Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2009, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,009 million, of which $182 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $827 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 5. \n\nCommercial Commitments \n\nThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2009. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) &#160; Total Amounts Committed/Maximum Amount of Loss &#160; Less than 1 year &#160; 1-3 \n\nyears \n\n&#160; 4-5 \n\nyears \n\n&#160; After 5 years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds \n\n&#160; $ 7,052 &#160; $ 5,944 &#160; $ 770 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 335 Commercial aircraft financing commitments \n\n&#160; &#160; 10,409 &#160; &#160; 1,873 &#160; &#160; 1,313 &#160; &#160; 2,753 &#160; &#160; 4,470 Total commercial commitments \n\n&#160; $ 17,461 &#160; $ 7,817 &#160; $ 2,083 &#160; $ 2,756 &#160; $ 4,805 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCommercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers; however there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11. \n\nContingent Obligations \n\nWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: \n\nLegal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs and employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees. \n\nEnvironmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $706 million at December 31, 2009. For additional information, see Note 11. \n\nIncome Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,787 million at December 31, 2009 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nContract Accounting \n\nContract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. \n\nDue to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. \n\nThe development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract&#146;s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. \n\n&#160; \n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2009 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $337 million. A number of our contracts are in a reach&#150;forward loss position. Changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings. \n\nProgram Accounting \n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. \n\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. \n\nTo ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. \n\nThe program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. \n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 program, for all of 2009 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $275 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are \n\n&#160; \n\nrecorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. \n\nAircraft Valuation \n\nAllowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. \n\nThree primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customer&#146;s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2009, the allowance would have decreased by $142 million or increased by $308 million. If the collateral values were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2009, the allowance would have decreased by $56 million or increased by $54 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased by $6 million or decreased by $6 million. \n\nImpairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. \n\nWhen we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. \n\nHad future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. \n\nLease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 10% at December 31, 2009, this would result in a future cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of approximately $180 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $45 million would be recognized in 2010. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments \n\nGoodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the \n\n&#160; \n\namount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. \n\nWe estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. \n\nThe cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. \n\nChanges in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. \n\nAs of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $499 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. \n\nPostretirement Plans \n\nSubstantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders&#146; equity. \n\nIn the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2009. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) &#160; Change in discount rate Increase 25 bps &#160; &#160; Change in discount rate Decrease 25 bps Pension plans \n\n&#160; &#160; Projected benefit obligation \n\n&#160; $ (1,478 ) &#160; $ 1,817 Net periodic pension cost \n\n&#160; &#160; (166 ) &#160; &#160; 189 Other postretirement benefit plans \n\n&#160; &#160; Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation \n\n&#160; &#160; (163 ) &#160; &#160; 192 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost \n\n&#160; &#160; (12 ) &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2009 net periodic pension expense by $117 million. \n\nDifferences between actual and expected returns can affect future year&#146;s pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Despite investment gains during 2009, the significant losses incurred during 2008 will cause net periodic pension cost for 2010 to increase by approximately $100 million due to amortization of actuarial losses. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions, net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years. \n\nThe assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year&#146;s expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders&#146; Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2009. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) &#160; Change in medical trend rate Increase 100 bps &#160; Change in medical trend rate Decrease 100 bps &#160; Other postretirement benefit plans \n\n&#160; &#160; Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation \n\n&#160; $ 617 &#160; $ (541 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost \n\n&#160; &#160; 119 &#160; &#160; (104 ) &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n"}
