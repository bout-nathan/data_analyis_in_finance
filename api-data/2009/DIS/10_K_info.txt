Related after-tax interest expense of $12 million for fiscal 2008 has been added back for the calculation of diluted earnings per share. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOrganization of Information \n\nManagement&#146;s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Company&#146;s financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Consolidated Results \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Business Segment Results &#151; 2010 vs. 2009 \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Non-Segment Items &#151; 2010 vs. 2009 \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Pension and Benefit Costs \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Business Segment Results &#151; 2009 vs. 2008 \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Non-Segment Items &#151; 2009 vs. 2008 \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Accounting Changes \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Forward-Looking Statements \n\n##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS \n\n2010 vs. 2009 \n\nRevenues for the year increased 5%, or $1.9 billion, to $38.1 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 20%, or $656 million, to $4.0 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to Disney (EPS) increased 15% to $2.03. \n\nNet income attributable to Disney for the current year included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.09 per diluted share), gains on the sales of investments in two television services in Europe ($0.02 per diluted share), a gain on the sale of the Power Rangers property ($0.01 per diluted share), and an accounting gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan ($0.01 per diluted share), which collectively had a net adverse impact of $0.04. Fiscal 2009 included restructuring and impairment charges ($0.17 per diluted share), a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime and AETN ($0.08 per diluted share) and a gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America ($0.04 per diluted share). Including the impact of rounding, these items collectively resulted in a net adverse impact of $0.06 per diluted share. The current year results also include one fewer week of operations compared to fiscal 2009 due to our fiscal period end. \n\nThe increase in EPS for the current year reflected higher operating results due to higher revenues from MVSPs (Affiliate Fees), increased advertising revenues at our cable and broadcast businesses, the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 , and lower distribution and marketing costs at our home entertainment business, partially offset by higher programming, general and administrative and production costs at our cable business and higher costs at our domestic parks and resorts operations. \n\n2009 vs. 2008 \n\nRevenues for fiscal 2009 decreased 4%, or $1.7 billion, to $36.1 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased 25%, or $1.1 billion, to $3.3 billion; and EPS decreased 23% to $1.76. \n\nAs discussed above, net income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2009 included certain items which affected comparability. Fiscal 2008 included an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America and a gain on the sale of movies.com (together $0.01 per diluted share), the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters ($0.03 per diluted share), a bad debt charge for a receivable from Lehman Brothers ($0.03 per diluted share) and an impairment charge ($0.01 per diluted share). These items collectively had no net impact on EPS. Fiscal 2009 results also include the benefit from one additional week of operations compared to fiscal 2008 due to the timing of our fiscal period end. \n\nThe decrease in EPS for fiscal 2009 reflected lower operating results and the items discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding. The decrease in operating results was primarily due to lower broadcast and cable advertising revenues, a decline in worldwide sales of DVD units, decreased guest spending at our parks and resorts, higher programming costs and production cost amortization at our cable and broadcast businesses, lower performance of our movies in worldwide theatrical and television distribution and lower earned revenue at our licensing business. These decreases were partially offset by contractual rate increases on Affiliate Fees, cost mitigation activities at parks and resorts and higher international and domestic sales of programs at broadcasting. \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $270 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the current year related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily for severance and other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of writeoffs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $492 million in fiscal 2009 which included impairment charges of $279 million and restructuring costs of $213 million. The most significant of the impairment charges were $142 million related to FCC radio licenses and $65 million related to our investment in UTV Software Communications Limited (UTV). The restructuring charges included severance and other related costs as a result of organizational and cost structure initiatives across our businesses. Restructuring and impairment charges for fiscal 2008 consisted of an impairment charge of $39 million related to FCC radio licenses. \n\nOther Income (Expense) \n\nOther income (expense) is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; Gain on sales of investments in television services in Europe \n\n&#160; $ 75 &#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; Gain on sale of Power Rangers property \n\n&#160; &#160; 43 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan \n\n&#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; &#160; Gain on AETN/Lifetime transaction (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 228 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain on sale of investment in two pay television services in Latin America \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 114 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store North America \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; Gain on sale of movies.com \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; Bad debt charge for Lehman Brothers receivable \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (91 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other income (expense) \n\n&#160; $ 140 &#160; &#160; $ 342 &#160; &#160; $ (59 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) On September 15, 2009, the Company and the Hearst Corporation both contributed their 50% interest in Lifetime to AETN in exchange for an increased interest in AETN. The transaction resulted in a $228 million non-cash gain. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of this transaction. \n\n##TABLE_END BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS &#151; 2010 vs. 2009 \n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments.

The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 9% due to higher sold inventory. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 4% due to higher network advertising rates and sold inventory and 3% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by decreases due to lower network ratings of 4% and one fewer week of operations. \n\nOther revenues decreased $94 million at Cable Networks and $90 million at Broadcasting. The decrease at Cable Networks was driven by the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected lower domestic television syndication revenues due to the prior-year sales of According to Jim and Grey&#146;s Anatomy . \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include an increase in programming and production costs of $383 million from $8,223 million to $8,606 million. At Cable Networks an increase in programming and production costs of $452 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to new international sports programming rights and increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming. At Broadcasting a decrease in programming and production costs of $69 million was driven by costs savings at news and daytime and a lower cost mix of programming in primetime. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher pension and postretirement medical and other employee costs, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $60 million due to the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with a bankruptcy of a syndication customer in the prior year and also a decrease due to the closure of five ESPN Zone restaurants in June 2010. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 8%, or $367 million, to $5.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher affiliate fees, increased advertising sales and the absence of a bad debt charge from a syndication customer, partially offset by higher programming costs, higher general and administrative expenses and lower domestic television syndication revenues. Segment operating income includes income from equity investees of $438 million for the year, compared to $567 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by a $58 million charge for our share of programming writeoffs at AETN/Lifetime in the current year. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; $ 11,475 &#160; &#160; $ 10,555 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,687 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,654 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 17,162 &#160; &#160; $ 16,209 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Segment operating income \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; $ 4,473 &#160; &#160; $ 4,260 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 659 &#160; &#160; &#160; 505 &#160; &#160; &#160; 30 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 5,132 &#160; &#160; $ 4,765 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Restructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $95 million, $315 million and $39 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. The charges in fiscal 2009 were primarily due to $142 million of radio FCC license impairments, a $65 million impairment charge related to our investment in UTV Group and severance and related costs. The charge in fiscal 2008 was due to impairments of radio FCC licenses. These charges were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nParks and Resorts \n\nOperating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic \n\n&#160; $ 8,404 &#160; &#160; $ 8,442 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; % International \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,357 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,225 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 10,761 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,667 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (6,787 ) &#160; &#160; (6,634 ) &#160; &#160; (2 )% Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,517 ) &#160; &#160; (1,467 ) &#160; &#160; (3 )% Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,139 ) &#160; &#160; (1,148 ) &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 1,318 &#160; &#160; $ 1,418 &#160; &#160; &#160; (7 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nParks and Resorts revenues increased 1%, or $94 million, to $10.8 billion due to an increase of $132 million at our international operations, partially offset by a decrease of $38 million at our domestic operations. \n\nThe decline in revenue at our domestic operations reflected the impact of one fewer week of operations and a 1% volume decrease reflecting lower vacation club ownership sales, lower hotel occupancy and lower passenger cruise ship days. These decreases were partially offset by higher guest spending primarily due to higher average ticket prices and higher average daily hotel room rates. \n\nThe 6% revenue increase at our international operations reflected increases of 3% due to higher guest spending and 3% due to the sale of a real estate property as well as higher attendance and hotel occupancy.

In addition, operating expense reflected increased costs for new guest offerings including World of Color at Disneyland Resort. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by increased marketing costs in support of the Disney Cruise Line fleet expansion and also World of Color at Disneyland Resort as well as labor cost inflation. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 7%, or $100 million, to $1.3 billion, due to a decrease at our domestic operations, partially offset by an improvement at our international operations. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $54 million in fiscal 2009 for severance and related costs which were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Theatrical distribution \n\n&#160; $ 2,050 &#160; &#160; $ 1,325 &#160; &#160; &#160; 55 % Home entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,666 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,762 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3 )% Television distribution and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,985 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,049 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,701 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,136 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (3,469 ) &#160; &#160; (3,210 ) &#160; &#160; (8 )% Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,450 ) &#160; &#160; (2,687 ) &#160; &#160; 9 % Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (89 ) &#160; &#160; (60 ) &#160; &#160; (48 )% Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (4 ) &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 693 &#160; &#160; $ 175 &#160; &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the strong performance of Toy Story 3 , Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in the current year. Other key releases included A Christmas Carol and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in the current year and Up and The Proposal in the prior year. \n\nThe decrease in home entertainment revenues was primarily due to a 2% decrease reflecting lower net effective pricing and a 2% decrease driven by lower sales volume of new releases in domestic markets. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. \n\nThe decrease in television distribution and other reflected the strong prior-year performance of High School Musical 3 and Rascal Flatts CD titles as well as the Cheetah Girls concert tour in the prior year. \n\nCost and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included an increase in film cost amortization of $385 million from $1,757 million to $2,142 million driven by the strong performance of our key theatrical releases and higher film cost write-downs, partially offset by a decrease in costs of goods sold of $35 million from $384 million to $349 million driven by cost reduction initiatives at our home entertainment business. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses reflected a decrease in marketing costs at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased from $175 million to $693 million primarily due to the improvements in our theatrical and home entertainment businesses, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $151 million and $47 million for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs and writeoffs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects and the closure of a studio production facility. The charges in fiscal 2009 were primarily severance and related costs. These charges were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nConsumer Products \n\nOperating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Licensing and publishing \n\n&#160; $ 1,725 &#160; &#160; $ 1,584 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % Retail and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 953 &#160; &#160; &#160; 841 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,678 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,425 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,236 ) &#160; &#160; (1,182 ) &#160; &#160; (5 )% Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (687 ) &#160; &#160; (597 ) &#160; &#160; (15 )% Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (78 ) &#160; &#160; (39 ) &#160; &#160; nm &#160; Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 677 &#160; &#160; $ 609 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe increase in licensing and publishing revenue was primarily due to an increase of $221 million resulting from the acquisition of Marvel and the strong performance of Toy Story merchandise, partially offset by a higher revenue share with the Studio Entertainment segment of $90 million. \n\nHigher retail and other revenues were driven by a $69 million increase due to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and an increase of $33 million at The Disney Store North America and Europe reflecting higher comparable store sales. \n\n&#160; \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included cost of goods sold of $521 million which was comparable to the prior year as increases due to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and sales of Marvel merchandise were offset by lower third-party royalties and decreased costs of sales at The Disney Store North America due to an improved global purchasing strategy. Other operating costs increased due to the addition of Marvel and The Disney Store Japan. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other was driven by the acquisitions of Marvel and The Disney Store Japan. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 11%, or $68 million, to $677 million due to improved results at our retail business and an increase in our publishing business driven by Marvel titles. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $16 million and $19 million for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were for severance and related costs which were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nInteractive Media \n\nOperating results for the Interactive Media segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Game sales and subscriptions \n\n&#160; $ 563 &#160; &#160; $ 565 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; % Advertising and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 198 &#160; &#160; &#160; 147 &#160; &#160; &#160; 35 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 761 &#160; &#160; &#160; 712 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (581 ) &#160; &#160; (623 ) &#160; &#160; 7 % Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (371 ) &#160; &#160; (336 ) &#160; &#160; (10 )% Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (43 ) &#160; &#160; (50 ) &#160; &#160; 14 % Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Loss \n\n&#160; $ (234 ) &#160; $ (295 ) &#160; &#160; 21 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nGame sales and subscription revenue was essentially flat as lower unit sales of self published console games were offset by higher subscription revenues at Club Penguin. Significant titles in the current year included Toy Story 3, Split Second and Sing It 2 while the prior year included High School Musical 3, Sing It and Bolt. \n\nHigher advertising and other revenue was driven by increases at our mobile phone service business in Japan and in online advertising. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a decrease in costs of goods sold of $70 million from $266 million to $196 million due to lower video game costs reflecting a sales mix shift from higher cost new releases, which included bundled accessories, in the prior year to lower cost catalog titles in the current year. This decrease was partially offset by increased product development expense of $24 million. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected higher marketing costs driven by Toy Story 3 and Split Second . \n\nSegment Operating Loss \n\nSegment operating loss decreased 21%, or $61 million, to $234 million driven by improved results at our games and Japan mobile phone service businesses, partially offset by the impact of purchase accounting for Playdom. \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $2 million and $42 million for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2009 were for goodwill impairment and severance and related costs. These charges were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nNON-SEGMENT ITEMS &#150; 2010 vs. 2009 \n\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 6%, from $398 million to $420 million, primarily due to higher information technology and compensation costs. \n\nNet Interest Expense \n\nNet interest expense is detailed below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; % Change Better/ (Worse) &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (456 ) &#160; $ (588 ) &#160; &#160; 22 % Interest and investment income \n\n&#160; &#160; 47 &#160; &#160; &#160; 122 &#160; &#160; &#160; (61 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (409 ) &#160; $ (466 ) &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense for the year was primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average debt balances, partially offset by expense related to the early redemption of a film financing borrowing. \n\nThe decrease in interest and investment income for the year was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior year, lower effective interest rates and lower average cash balances. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\nThe effective income tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points from 36.2% in 2009 to 34.9% in 2010. The lower effective income tax rate for the year was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to prior-year income tax matters, partially offset by a $72 million charge related to the health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $48 million to $350 million driven by improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland and ESPN. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined based on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. \n\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS \n\nPension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $482 million, $214 million, and $255 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations and asset returns that were below the assumed return. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company&#146;s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. \n\nWe expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $94 million to $576 million in fiscal 2011 driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. The decrease in the discount rate also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense which is $3.0 billion ($1.9 billion after tax) as of October 2, 2010. If our investment performance does not improve relative to our long-term assumption and/or discount rates do not increase, we expect that \n\n&#160; \n\npension and postretirement medical costs will continue at levels comparable to fiscal 2011 for the next few years as a result of amortizing these unrecognized expenses. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements. During fiscal 2010, the Company made contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans totaling $433 million, which included discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2011 of approximately $450 million, which is expected to include discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2011 will be determined based on our January 1, 2011 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2011. See &#147;Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors&#148; for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs. \n\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS &#150; 2009 vs. 2008 \n\nMedia Networks \n\nOperating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; September 27, 2008 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Affiliate Fees \n\n&#160; $ 7,407 &#160; &#160; $ 6,793 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % Advertising \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,566 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,136 &#160; &#160; &#160; (8 )% Other \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,236 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,928 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 16,209 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15,857 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (9,556 ) &#160; &#160; (9,011 ) &#160; &#160; (6 )% Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,249 ) &#160; &#160; (2,273 ) &#160; &#160; 1 % Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (206 ) &#160; &#160; (188 ) &#160; &#160; (10 )% Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; 567 &#160; &#160; &#160; 596 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 4,765 &#160; &#160; $ 4,981 &#160; &#160; &#160; (4 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe 9% increase in Affiliate Fees was due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth at Cable Networks which resulted in revenue increases of 6% and 3%, respectively, and the impact of the additional week of operations. \n\nLower advertising revenues were due to decreases at Broadcasting of $421 million from $4,298 million to $3,877 million and Cable Networks of $149 million from $2,838 million to $2,689 million. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected a decrease of 6% due to lower network ratings and a decrease of 5% in local television advertising, partially offset by the benefit of one additional week of operations. The decrease at Cable Networks reflected a decrease of 8% due to fewer units sold, partially offset by an increase of 4% due to higher rates. \n\nOther revenues increased $259 million at Broadcasting and $49 million at Cable Networks. The increase at Broadcasting reflected higher international and domestic sales of programs driven by Grey&#146;s Anatomy, Private Practice, and Criminal Minds . \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include an increase in programming and production costs of $455 million from $7,768 million to $8,223 million. At Cable Networks an increase in programming and production spending of $200 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to contractual rate increases for key contracts and costs of new and renewed contracts for college and international sports programming. At Broadcasting the increase in programming and production spending of $255 million was driven by more hours of original scripted primetime programming and higher production cost amortization related to program sales. \n\nThe decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses included lower marketing and sales expense, partially offset by a bad debt charge in connection with a bankruptcy of a syndication customer of approximately $60 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 4%, or $216 million, to $4.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising sales, higher programming costs and the syndication customer bad debt charge, partially offset by higher affiliate fees, increased program sales and lower marketing and sales expense. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; September 27, 2008 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; $ 10,555 &#160; &#160; $ 10,041 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,654 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,816 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 16,209 &#160; &#160; $ 15,857 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Segment operating income \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,260 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,139 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 505 &#160; &#160; &#160; 842 &#160; &#160; &#160; (40 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 4,765 &#160; &#160; $ 4,981 &#160; &#160; &#160; (4 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Parks and Resorts \n\nOperating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; September 27, 2008 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic \n\n&#160; $ 8,442 &#160; &#160; $ 8,973 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6 )% International \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,225 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,531 &#160; &#160; &#160; (12 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 10,667 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,504 &#160; &#160; &#160; (7 )% Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (6,634 ) &#160; &#160; (6,921 ) &#160; &#160; 4 % Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,467 ) &#160; &#160; (1,541 ) &#160; &#160; 5 % Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,148 ) &#160; &#160; (1,145 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 1,418 &#160; &#160; $ 1,897 &#160; &#160; &#160; (25 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nParks and Resorts revenues decreased 7%, or $837 million, to $10.7 billion due to decreases of $531 million at our domestic operations and $306 million at our international operations. \n\nThe decline in our domestic operations reflected a 6% decrease due to lower guest spending driven by lower average ticket prices, lower average daily hotel room rates, and decreased merchandise spending. In addition, lower gains on securitized sales of vacation ownership interests (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were partially offset by an increase in revenue recognition in connection with the completion of a vacation club property. \n\nThe decrease in our international operations reflected the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 7% as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro at Disneyland Paris. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Domestic &#160; &#160; International (2) &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2009 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2008 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2009 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2008 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2009 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2008 &#160; Parks \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Increase/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Attendance \n\n&#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 3 % Per Capita Guest Spending \n\n&#160; &#160; (6 ) % &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; (12 ) % &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; (7 ) % &#160; &#160; 5 % Hotels (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Occupancy \n\n&#160; &#160; 87 % &#160; &#160; 89 % &#160; &#160; 85 % &#160; &#160; 89 % &#160; &#160; 86 % &#160; &#160; 89 % Available Room Nights (in thousands) \n\n&#160; &#160; 9,549 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,367 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,473 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,472 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,022 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,839 &#160; Per Room Guest Spending \n\n&#160; $ 214 &#160; &#160; $ 233 &#160; &#160; $ 261 &#160; &#160; $ 294 &#160; &#160; $ 223 &#160; &#160; $ 246 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels.

Guest spending statistics for Disneyland Paris were converted from Euros into US Dollars at weighted average exchange rates of 1.35 and 1.50 for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a decrease in operating labor of $119 million from $3,224 million to $3,105 million driven by savings from cost mitigation activities, partially offset by labor cost inflation and a decrease in cost of sales of $54 million from $1,221 million to $1,167 million due to decreased sales volume, partially offset by expense recognition in connection with the completion of a vacation club property. In addition to these decreases, operating expense reflected a 2% reduction from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. \n\nThe decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and savings from cost mitigation activities. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 25%, or $479 million, to $1.4 billion, due to decreases at our domestic operations and at Disneyland Paris. \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; September 27, 2008 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Theatrical distribution \n\n&#160; $ 1,325 &#160; &#160; $ 1,230 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % Home Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,762 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,740 &#160; &#160; &#160; (26 )% Television distribution and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,049 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,378 &#160; &#160; &#160; (14 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,136 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,348 &#160; &#160; &#160; (16 )% Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (3,210 ) &#160; &#160; (3,452 ) &#160; &#160; 7 % Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,687 ) &#160; &#160; (2,760 ) &#160; &#160; 3 % Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (60 ) &#160; &#160; (50 ) &#160; &#160; (20 )% Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; (4 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 175 &#160; &#160; $ 1,086 &#160; &#160; &#160; (84 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe increase in theatrical distribution was due to the success of key films released in fiscal 2009. Key titles in fiscal 2009 included Up and The Proposal while fiscal 2008 included National Treasure 2 and WALL-E . \n\n&#160; \n\nThe decrease in home entertainment revenues was primarily due to a 25% decrease reflecting lower unit sales and a 5% decrease driven by lower net effective pricing reflecting the overall decline in the DVD market and the strength of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#146;s End in fiscal 2008. Other significant titles included WALL-E and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian in fiscal 2009 while fiscal 2008 included Ratatouille , National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets and Enchanted . \n\nThe decrease in television distribution and other reflected fewer significant titles in fiscal 2009 at television distribution and the strong performance of the Hannah Montana concert tour and Miley Cyrus and Jonas Brothers CD titles in fiscal 2008. \n\nCost and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a decrease in film cost amortization of $134 million from $1,891 million to $1,757 million and a decrease in costs of goods sold of $44 million from $428 million to $384 million, both of which were driven by a decline in DVD unit sales at home entertainment. Additionally, distribution costs decreased due to the absence of costs associated with the Hannah Montana concert tour which occurred in fiscal 2008. The decrease in film cost amortization due to lower DVD volume was partially offset by higher film cost write-downs. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses reflected a decrease in marketing costs driven by a decline in DVD unit sales at home entertainment, partially offset by higher marketing costs for fiscal 2009 theatrical releases. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 84%, or $911 million, to $175 million primarily due to decreases at worldwide home entertainment and worldwide television distribution and higher film cost write-downs. \n\nConsumer Products \n\nOperating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; September 27, 2008 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Licensing and publishing \n\n&#160; $ 1,584 &#160; &#160; $ 1,681 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6 )% Retail stores and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 841 &#160; &#160; &#160; 734 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,425 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,415 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; % Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,182 ) &#160; &#160; (962 ) &#160; &#160; (23 )% Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (597 ) &#160; &#160; (646 ) &#160; &#160; 8 % Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (39 ) &#160; &#160; (29 ) &#160; &#160; (34 )% Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; $ 609 &#160; &#160; $ 778 &#160; &#160; &#160; (22 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe decrease in licensing and publishing revenue was due to lower royalty revenue of $129 million across multiple product categories, due to the difficult retail environment as well as the strength of Hannah Montana and High School Musical properties in fiscal 2008, and lower magazine sales driven by the closure of Wondertime magazine. \n\nHigher retail and other revenue was primarily due to an increase of $231 million from the inclusion of seven additional months of operations at The Disney Store North America which was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, partially offset by a decrease of $55 million from the impact of foreign currency translation at The Disney Store Europe as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Euro. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included an increase in costs of goods sold of $123 million, from $397 million to $520 million, as well as other cost increases due to the acquisition of The Disney Store North America in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. This increase was partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency translation at The Disney Store Europe as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Euro and lower costs of sales and other operating costs at Publishing driven by the closure of Wondertime magazine. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe decrease in selling, general, administrative and other was driven by cost savings initiatives. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 22%, or $169 million, to $609 million due to lower results at our licensing and retail businesses, which reflected the adverse impact of a full year of company-owned operations at The Disney Store North America in fiscal 2009 whereas fiscal 2008 included five months of company-owned operations and seven months of licensed operations. \n\nInteractive Media \n\nOperating results for the Interactive Media segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; September 27, 2008 &#160; &#160; Better / (Worse) &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Game sales and subscriptions \n\n&#160; $ 565 &#160; &#160; $ 603 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6 )% Advertising and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 147 &#160; &#160; &#160; 116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 712 &#160; &#160; &#160; 719 &#160; &#160; &#160; (1 )% Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (623 ) &#160; &#160; (578 ) &#160; &#160; (8 )% Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (336 ) &#160; &#160; (349 ) &#160; &#160; 4 % Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (50 ) &#160; &#160; (47 ) &#160; &#160; (6 )% Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; (3 ) &#160; &#160; nm &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating Loss \n\n&#160; $ (295 ) &#160; $ (258 ) &#160; &#160; (14 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe decrease in game sales and subscription revenue of $38 million was driven by decreased net effective pricing and unit sales of self-published console games and lower revenues from licensed titles primarily due to the performance of WALL-E, Cars and Ratatouille in fiscal 2008, partially offset by increased subscription revenues at Club Penguin. Significant titles in fiscal 2009 included High School Musical 3, Sing It and Bolt as compared to fiscal 2008, which included High School Musical, Turok , Hannah Montana 2 and Pure. \n\nThe increase in advertising and other revenue was driven by an increase at our mobile phone service business in Japan, which was launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include an increase in costs of goods sold of $46 million from $220 million to $266 million driven by higher unit costs for fiscal 2009 titles that included bundled accessories and higher music royalties for certain game titles. \n\nThe decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by lower marketing costs at Disney Online. \n\nSegment Operating Loss \n\nSegment operating loss increased 14%, or $37 million, to $295 million driven by lower games results partially offset by higher online advertising. \n\nNON-SEGMENT ITEMS &#150; 2009 vs. 2008 \n\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses decreased 13%, from $460 million to $398 million, driven by savings from cost mitigation activities and an increase in allocation of costs to the business segments. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Interest Expense \n\nNet interest expense is detailed below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; % Change Better/(Worse) &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (588 ) &#160; $ (712 ) &#160; &#160; 17 % Interest and investment income \n\n&#160; &#160; 122 &#160; &#160; &#160; 188 &#160; &#160; &#160; (35 )% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (466 ) &#160; $ (524 ) &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense and interest and investment income for the year was driven by lower effective interest rates. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\nThe effective tax rate was comparable to the prior year at 36.2% as the favorable impact of legislative changes in fiscal 2009 was offset by the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters in fiscal 2008. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was flat at $302 million as the impact of lower financing costs at Hong Kong Disneyland and improved operating results at ESPN were offset by lower performance at Disneyland Paris. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; Cash provided by operations \n\n&#160; $ 6,578 &#160; &#160; $ 5,319 &#160; &#160; $ 5,701 &#160; Cash used by investing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; (4,523 ) &#160; &#160; (1,755 ) &#160; &#160; (2,162 ) Cash used by financing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,750 ) &#160; &#160; (3,148 ) &#160; &#160; (4,208 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (Decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; $ (695 ) &#160; $ 416 &#160; &#160; $ (669 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Operating Activities \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 increased 24% or $1.3 billion to $6.6 billion as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was driven by higher operating cash receipts at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment businesses and lower cash payments at our Studio Entertainment segment driven by a decrease in distribution and marketing expense, partially offset by higher income tax payments. The increase in cash receipts at our Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments was driven by higher revenues, while the increase in cash receipts at Parks and Resorts was driven by the timing of advance travel deposits. \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 decreased 7% or $382 million to $5.3 billion as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was driven by lower operating cash receipts at our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment businesses and higher contributions to our pension plans, partially offset by lower income tax payments and higher operating cash receipts at Media Networks. The decrease in cash receipts at our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments was driven by lower revenues, while the increase in cash receipts at Media Networks was driven by higher revenues and the timing of collections of accounts receivable. \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation expense is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; Media Networks \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; $ 118 &#160; &#160; $ 108 &#160; &#160; $ 89 &#160; Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 95 &#160; &#160; &#160; 89 &#160; &#160; &#160; 90 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Media Networks \n\n&#160; &#160; 213 &#160; &#160; &#160; 197 &#160; &#160; &#160; 179 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Parks and Resorts \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic \n\n&#160; &#160; 807 &#160; &#160; &#160; 822 &#160; &#160; &#160; 803 &#160; International \n\n&#160; &#160; 332 &#160; &#160; &#160; 326 &#160; &#160; &#160; 342 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Parks and Resorts \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,139 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,148 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,145 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Studio Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 56 &#160; &#160; &#160; 50 &#160; &#160; &#160; 41 &#160; Consumer Products \n\n&#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; Interactive Media \n\n&#160; &#160; 19 &#160; &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 142 &#160; &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; &#160; 123 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total depreciation expense \n\n&#160; $ 1,602 &#160; &#160; $ 1,580 &#160; &#160; $ 1,527 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company&#146;s broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability. \n\nThe Company&#146;s film and television production and programming activity for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; Beginning balances: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Production and programming assets \n\n&#160; $ 5,756 &#160; &#160; $ 5,935 &#160; &#160; $ 5,682 &#160; Programming liabilities \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,193 ) &#160; &#160; (1,108 ) &#160; &#160; (1,210 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,563 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,827 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,472 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Spending: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Film and television production \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,370 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,421 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,237 &#160; Broadcast programming \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,316 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,896 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,812 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,686 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,317 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,049 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Amortization: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Film and television production \n\n&#160; &#160; (3,593 ) &#160; &#160; (3,486 ) &#160; &#160; (3,076 ) Broadcast programming \n\n&#160; &#160; (4,331 ) &#160; &#160; (3,788 ) &#160; &#160; (3,672 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (7,924 ) &#160; &#160; (7,274 ) &#160; &#160; (6,748 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change in film and television production and programming costs \n\n&#160; &#160; (238 ) &#160; &#160; 43 &#160; &#160; &#160; 301 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other non-cash activity \n\n&#160; &#160; 136 &#160; &#160; &#160; (154 ) &#160; &#160; 54 &#160; Ending balances: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Production and programming assets \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,451 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,756 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,935 &#160; Programming liabilities \n\n&#160; &#160; (990 ) &#160; &#160; (1,040 ) &#160; &#160; (1,108 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 4,461 &#160; &#160; $ 4,716 &#160; &#160; $ 4,827 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nInvesting activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts, and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity.

The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2010 reflected higher construction progress payments on two new cruise ships, the expansion at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disney California Adventure and the construction of a Disney Vacation Club Resort in Hawaii. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2009 reflected spending on the Disney California Adventure expansion and construction progress payments on two new cruise ships. \n\nCapital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities. \n\nCapital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in information technology and other equipment and corporate facilities. The increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by investments in equipment and corporate facilities. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nDuring fiscal 2010, acquisitions totaled $2.5 billion and included the acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Playdom, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by net proceeds totaling $170 million from the sale of our investments in two television services in Europe and the sale of the rights and assets related to the Power Rangers property. \n\nDuring fiscal 2009, acquisitions totaled $176 million and included the purchase of additional interests in UTV (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), offset by proceeds totaling $185 million from the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America. \n\nDuring fiscal 2008, acquisitions totaled $660 million which included an additional interest in UTV. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 decreased by $398 million to $2.8 billion compared to fiscal 2009 and consisted of repurchases of common stock, repayments of borrowings, the payment of dividends partially offset by exercises of stock options. The decrease from fiscal 2009 was due to lower repayments of borrowings and increased proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by higher share repurchases. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2009 decreased by $1.1 billion to $3.1 billion compared to fiscal 2008 and consisted of repayments of borrowings, the payment of dividends, the liquidation of a noncontrolling interest and repurchases of common stock. The decrease from fiscal 2008 was due to lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher repayments of borrowings, the liquidation of the noncontrolling interest and decreased proceeds from stock option exercises. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the year ended October 2, 2010, the Company&#146;s borrowing activity was as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; October 3, 2009 &#160; &#160; Additions &#160; &#160; Payments &#160; &#160; Other Activity &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; Commercial paper borrowings \n\n&#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ 1,190 &#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; $ 1,190 &#160; U.S. medium-term notes \n\n&#160; &#160; 7,618 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (807 ) &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,815 &#160; European medium-term notes \n\n&#160; &#160; 347 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (88 ) &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; 273 &#160; Other foreign currency denominated debt (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 904 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 61 &#160; &#160; &#160; 965 &#160; Capital Cities / ABC debt \n\n&#160; &#160; 116 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#160; 115 &#160; Film financing \n\n&#160; &#160; 350 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (350 ) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Other (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 498 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; &#160; 43 &#160; &#160; &#160; 536 &#160; Euro Disney borrowings (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,344 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (121 ) &#160; &#160; (110 ) &#160; &#160; 2,113 &#160; Hong Kong Disneyland borrowings ( 4 ) \n\n&#160; &#160; 524 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (51 ) &#160; &#160; 473 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 12,701 &#160; &#160; $ 1,190 &#160; &#160; $ (1,371 ) &#160; $ (40 ) &#160; $ 12,480 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 2 ) The other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ( 4 ) The other activity is due to the conversion of the HKSAR&#146;s loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\n##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s bank facilities are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Committed Capacity &#160; &#160; Capacity Used &#160; &#160; Unused Capacity &#160; Bank facilities expiring February 2011 \n\n&#160; $ 2,225 &#160; &#160; $ 225 &#160; &#160; $ 2,000 &#160; Bank facilities expiring February 2013 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,250 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,250 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 4,475 &#160; &#160; $ 225 &#160; &#160; $ 4,250 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Company&#146;s public debt rating and can range from 0.18% to 4.5%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in February 2011, which if utilized, reduces available borrowing under this facility. As of October 2, 2010, $225 million of letters of credit had been issued under this facility. \n\nThe Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. \n\nThe Company paid a $653 million dividend ($0.35 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009. The Company paid a $648 million dividend ($0.35 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to fiscal 2008; and paid a $664 million dividend ($0.35 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 related to fiscal 2007. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2010. \n\nDuring fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 80 million shares of Disney common stock for $2.7 billion. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of Disney common stock for $138 million. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased 139 million shares of Disney common stock for $4.5 billion. As of October 2, 2010, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 99 million additional shares. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. \n\nWe believe that the Company&#146;s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company&#146;s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be \n\n&#160; \n\nimpacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See &#147;Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors&#148;. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company&#146;s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company&#146;s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of October 2, 2010, Moody&#146;s Investors Service&#146;s long and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s long and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitch&#146;s long and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Company&#146;s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 2, 2010, by a significant margin. The Company&#146;s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, from any representations, covenants or events of default. \n\nEuro Disney has annual covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investment and financing activities and require it to meet certain financial performance covenants. Subject to final third-party review as provided in its debt agreements, Euro Disney was in compliance with these covenants for fiscal year 2010. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nThe Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at October 2, 2010 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nContingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees \n\nThe Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#146;s contingent commitments and contractual guarantees. \n\nLegal and Tax Matters \n\nAs disclosed in Notes 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters. \n\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFilm and Television Revenues and Costs \n\nWe expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period&#146;s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. \n\nWith respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film&#146;s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Company&#146;s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. \n\nWith respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the program&#146;s rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company&#146;s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. \n\nThe cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs are expensed based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program&#146;s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. Rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season&#146;s relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during \n\n&#160; \n\nthe applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of the our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. \n\nCosts of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company&#146;s dayparts are daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies. \n\nWe reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated. \n\nRevenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a three-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition. \n\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions \n\nThe Company&#146;s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. \n\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 5.25% at the end of fiscal 2010 from 5.75% at the end of fiscal 2009 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our October 2, 2010 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2011. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company&#146;s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2011 by $199 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 2, 2010 by $1.6 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $167 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. \n\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% for the 2010 and 2009 actuarial valuations. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2011 annual benefit expense by approximately $60 million. \n\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments \n\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill. \n\nTo determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. \n\nIn times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company&#146;s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. \n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group&#146;s long-lived assets and its carrying value. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amount, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset&#146;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine the asset&#146;s fair value. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing the potential impairment for these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. \n\nDuring the current year, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were immaterial. During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $279 million, which included $142 million for FCC radio licenses and $65 million for our investment in UTV. During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $39 million related to FCC radio licenses. The FCC radio license impairment charges reflected overall market declines in certain radio markets in which we operate. These impairment charges, which were estimated using a discounted cash flow model, were recorded in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nWe evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectibility of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with \n\n&#160; \n\nwhich we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectibility of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods. \n\nContingencies and Litigation \n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. \n\nIncome Tax Audits \n\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company&#146;s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company&#146;s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. \n\nStock Option Compensation Expense \n\nEach year during the second quarter, the Company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management and creative personnel (the Annual Grant). To value these awards, the Company uses a binomial valuation model which takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. The binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being cancelled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option. Accordingly, the Company believes that the binomial valuation model should produce a fair value that is representative of the value of an employee option. \n\nIn fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, the weighted average assumptions used in the options-pricing models were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; Risk-free interest rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 3.5 % &#160; &#160; 2.0 % &#160; &#160; 3.6 % Expected volatility \n\n&#160; &#160; 32 % &#160; &#160; 47 % &#160; &#160; 29 % Dividend yield \n\n&#160; &#160; 1.41 % &#160; &#160; 1.19 % &#160; &#160; 1.02 % Termination rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.5 % &#160; &#160; 7.5 % &#160; &#160; 7.5 % Exercise multiple \n\n&#160; &#160; 1.40 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.39 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.39 &#160; ##TABLE_END Although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the Company&#146;s assumptions may change the value of, and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants. The assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the expected volatility and expected exercise multiple. Increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively. \n\nThe volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the Company&#146;s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. If the expected volatility of 32% used by the Company during 2010 was increased or decreased by five percentage points (i.e. to 37% or to 27%), the weighted average grant date fair value of our 2010 stock option grants would have increased by 9% or decreased by 9%, respectively. \n\nThe expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the Company&#146;s future stock performance, stock price volatility, and employee turnover rates. If the exercise multiple assumption of 1.4 used by the Company during 2010 were increased to 1.6 or decreased to 1.2, the weighted average binomial value of our 2010 stock option grants would have increased by 10% or decreased by 12%, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES \n\nRevenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables \n\nIn October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for the Company&#146;s 2011 fiscal year. The guidance revises the criteria for separating, measuring, and allocating arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable, which must be estimated if the Company does not have a history of selling the deliverable on a stand-alone basis or third-party evidence of selling price. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial statements. \n\nTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets \n\nIn June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, change the requirements for off balance sheet accounting for financial assets including limiting the circumstances where off balance sheet treatment for a portion of a financial asset is allowable, and require additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Company&#146;s 2011 fiscal year. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements. \n\nVariable Interest Entities \n\nIn June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated. The new consolidation model for VIEs considers whether an entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#146;s economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the VIE. The guidance on VIE&#146;s requires companies to continually reassess VIEs to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Company&#146;s 2011 fiscal year. The Company is assessing the potential effect this guidance will have on its financial statements. \n\nCollaborative Arrangements \n\nIn December 2007, the FASB issued guidance that defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting and reporting requirements for such arrangements. A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity, for example an agreement to co-produce and distribute a motion picture with another studio. The Company adopted the provisions of this collaborative arrangement guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements. \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nIn December 2007, the FASB issued guidance that establishes principles and requirements for determining how a company recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, including noncontrolling interests, contingent consideration, and certain acquired contingencies. The guidance on business combinations also requires acquisition-related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized. The Company adopted the provisions of this business combination guidance prospectively at the beginning of fiscal year 2010. \n\nNoncontrolling Interest (Minority Interest) \n\nIn December 2007, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting and reporting for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary which requires that noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity and that net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company be presented separately in the consolidated statement of income. The Company adopted the provisions of this noncontrolling interest guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2010. \n\nEmployee Compensation &#150; Retirement Benefits \n\nIn September 2006, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The guidance on retirement benefits also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the end of the fiscal year. The Company adopted the recognition provision in fiscal year 2007 which resulted in a $261 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the measurement date provision by remeasuring plan assets and benefit obligations at the beginning of fiscal 2009. Adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a reduction of $35 million to retained earnings and a $100 million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Tax \n\nIn July 2006, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company adopted the guidance on income taxes at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. Applying the guidance on income taxes to all tax positions upon adoption resulted in reductions of $148 million and $15 million to retained earnings and noncontrolling interests, respectively. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are &#147;forward-looking,&#148; including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management&#146;s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "}
