Discussions of the components of net income and segment operating income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis. \n\nOverview \n\nNet income per diluted share of $6.33 in 2009 grew by 32% over net income per diluted share of $4.81 on 2008. Net income of $3.62 billion in 2009 was 24% higher than 2008 net income of $2.92 billion. The higher rate of growth in per share income compared with growth in income reflected the impact of the Company's significant common share repurchases. The increase in net income in 2009 was driven by declines in the cost of catastrophes. In addition, the increase reflected net realized investment gains (versus net realized investment losses in 2008), lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and fewer large property losses, partially offset by reductions in underwriting margins related to pricing and loss cost trends, a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and lower fee income. The cost of catastrophes in 2009 totaled $457 million, compared with $1.41 billion in 2008. The 2008 total was principally comprised of $1.26 billion of claims and claim adjustment expenses and $141 million of property windpool assessments that were included in general and administrative \n\nexpenses. Net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $1.33 billion in 2009, compared with $1.54 billion in 2008. Net income in 2009 included a net benefit of $89 million due to the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. Net income in 2009 also benefited from $87 million of reductions in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike that had been recorded as a component of the cost of catastrophes in general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2008 (discussed below). Net income in 2008 reflected an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of a subsidiary. \n\nNet income of $4.81 per diluted share in 2008 was 30% lower than the $6.85 per diluted share in 2007. Net income in 2008 totaled $2.92 billion, 36% lower than $4.60 billion in 2007. The lower rate of decline in per share income compared with the rate of decline in actual income reflected the impact of the Company's significant common share repurchases. The decrease in net income in 2008 was primarily due to a significant increase in the cost of catastrophes and a significant decline in net investment income. Also contributing to the decline were net realized investment losses, a small increase in the number of large losses that exceeded expectations, an increase in non-catastrophe related weather losses, the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing, the impact of loss cost trends and a decline in fee income. Net income in 2008 reflected an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of a subsidiary. In 2007, net income included a net pretax benefit of $163 million due to the implementation of a new fixed, value-based compensation program for the majority of the Company's agents which resulted in a reduction in commission expense compared to what would have otherwise been reported, due to a change in the timing of expense recognition. These factors were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development, which totaled $1.54 billion in 2008, compared with $546 million in 2007. The cost of catastrophes in 2008, net of reinsurance and including hurricane-related assessments of $141 million (discussed below), totaled $1.41 billion, compared with $167 million in 2007. Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, as well as several other storms throughout the United States, accounted for the cost of catastrophes in 2008. Net income in 2007 also included a benefit of $86 million resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters and a pretax loss of $39 million related to the Company's redemption of its 4.50% contingently convertible debentures. \n\nHurricane-related property windpool assessments are levied on insurers periodically by state-created insurance and windstorm insurance entities such as Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in Florida, Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. These assessments are levied on the insurers writing business in those states to fund the operating deficits of such entities during periods of significant storm activity. Hurricane-related assessments are reported as a component of \"General and Administrative Expenses\" as the amounts paid to such entities are not insured losses of the Company. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums in 2009 totaled $21.42 billion, a decrease of $161 million, or 1%, from 2008. In the Business Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2009 declined 2% from 2008 despite strong business retention levels, attributable to reduced insured exposures due to lower levels of economic activity. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2009 declined 3% from 2008 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Adjusting for the impact of exchange rates, earned premiums in this segment were slightly higher than in 2008. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premium growth of 2% over 2008 reflected continued strong business retention rates and continued renewal premium increases. \n\nEarned premiums in 2008 totaled $21.58 billion, an increase of $109 million, or less than 1%, over 2007. In March 2007, the Company sold its Mexican surety subsidiary, Afianzadora Insurgentes, S.A. de C.V. (Afianzadora Insurgentes), which accounted for $27 million of earned premiums in 2007 prior \n\nto its sale. In April 2007, the Company sold Mendota Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, Mendota), which primarily offered nonstandard automobile coverage and accounted for $46 million of earned premiums in 2007 prior to its sale. Adjusting for these sales in 2007, consolidated earned premiums in 2008 increased by $182 million, or 1%, over 2007. In the Business Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2008 declined 1% from 2007 despite continued strong business retention rates, reflecting the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing and new business. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, earned premium growth of 2% in 2008 (adjusted for the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes) was driven by changes in the terms of certain reinsurance treaties for Bond &#38; Financial Products. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premium growth of 3% in 2008 (adjusted for the sale of Mendota) reflected continued strong business retention rates and new business volume, coupled with continued renewal price increases. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments. \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Average investments(a) &#160; $ 73,130 &#160; $ 74,197 &#160; $ 73,872 &#160; Pretax net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,776 &#160; &#160; 2,792 &#160; &#160; 3,761 &#160; After-tax net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,290 &#160; &#160; 2,299 &#160; &#160; 2,915 &#160; Average pretax yield(b) &#160; &#160; 3.8 % &#160; 3.8 % &#160; 5.1 % Average after-tax yield(b) &#160; &#160; 3.1 % &#160; 3.1 % &#160; 3.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income. (b) Excludes net realized investment gains and losses and net unrealized investment gains and losses. \n\nNet investment income of $2.78 billion in 2009 was $16 million, or less than 1%, lower than in 2008, primarily resulting from a significant decline in short-term interest rates, a lower average level of long-term fixed maturity invested assets and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Those factors were largely offset by improved returns from non-fixed maturity investments, which generated negative net investment income of $40 million in 2009, compared with negative net investment income of $222 million in 2008. The average pretax yield on the total investment portfolio was 3.8% in both 2009 and 2008. The improved performance from non-fixed income investments in 2009 reflected improving capital market conditions in the second half of the year. The amortized cost of the fixed maturity and short-term security portion of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 totaled $68.16 billion, $1.37 billion higher than at the same date in 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of strong operating cash flows during 2009 (a portion of which was invested in fixed maturity securities) and the issuance of $500 million of senior notes in the second quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset by $3.30 billion of common share repurchases during 2009, $693 million of dividends paid to shareholders and contributions of $260 million to the Company's pension plan in 2009. \n\nNet investment income of $2.79 billion in 2008 declined $969 million, or 26%, from 2007, primarily due to lower returns from non-fixed maturity investments, which produced negative net investment income of $222 million in 2008, compared with positive net investment income of $648 million in 2007. The decline in net investment income from these investments in 2008 reflected market conditions, which resulted in a lower level of transactions, including sales and initial public offerings, and lower market values compared to those at December 31, 2007. The average pretax yield on the total investment portfolio of 3.8% in 2008 declined from 5.1% in 2007, primarily reflecting the negative investment income from non-fixed maturity investments in 2008. Net investment income from the Company's fixed maturity portfolio in 2008 also declined from 2007, primarily due to a significant decline in short-term interest rates. The amortized cost of the fixed maturity and short-term security \n\nportion of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 totaled $66.79 billion, $2.55 billion lower than at the same date in 2007, primarily reflecting the use of $2.12 billion of funds for the Company's common share repurchases during 2008, the payment of $715 million of dividends to shareholders, the transfer of $662 million of fixed maturity investments as part of the sale of Unionamerica, and $450 million of contributions to the Company's pension plan, which were partially offset by strong cash flows from operating activities. \n\nExcept as described below for certain legal entities, the Company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable business segments. Pretax net investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. For investable funds, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves' future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were incurred and A+ rated corporate debt instrument yields. For capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio. The benchmark investment yields are applied to each segment's investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment. The Company's actual net investment income is allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment's notional investment income to total notional investment income. There are certain legal entities within the Company that are dedicated to specific reportable business segments. The invested assets and related net investment income from these legal entities are reported in the applicable business segment and are not allocated among the other business segments. \n\nFee Income \n\nThe National Accounts market in the Business Insurance segment is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. The declines in fee income in 2009 and 2008 compared with the respective prior years are described in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows. \n\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses) \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net realized investment gains (losses). \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other-than-temporary impairment losses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total losses &#160; $ (323 ) $ (420 ) $ (70 ) &#160; Portion of losses recognized in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources &#160; &#160; 65 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other-than-temporary impairment losses &#160; &#160; (258 ) &#160; (420 ) &#160; (70 ) Other net realized investment gains &#160; &#160; 275 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 224 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net realized investment gains (losses) &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ (415 ) $ 154 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted updated accounting guidance that changed the reporting of other-than-temporary impairments. See notes 1 and 3 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the adoption. \n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses on Investments&#151;In 2009, impairments included in net income totaled $258 million. Fixed income impairments in 2009 were $169 million and included $81 million of impairments related to structured mortgage securities, $70 million related to various issuers' deteriorated financial position and $18 million with respect to securities that the Company either had the intent to sell or did not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in \n\nfair value. Equity impairments in 2009 were $79 million, the majority of which were related to issuers in the financial services industry. Impairments in 2009 also included $10 million related to other investments. \n\nThe 2008 impairments included $186 million related to the deteriorated financial position of various issuers (including $70 million related to securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries), $113 million related to externally managed securities with respect to which the Company did not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value, $64 million related to structured mortgage securities and $57 million related to securities the Company had identified for potential sale prior to a recovery in fair value. \n\nImpairments in 2007 included $30 million related to externally managed securities with respect to which the Company did not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value, $30 million related to the deteriorated financial position of various issuers and $10 million related to the decline in the financial condition of one real estate development property. \n\nFurther information regarding the nature of impairment charges in each year is included in the \"Investment Portfolio\" section later in this discussion. \n\nOther Net Realized Investment Gains&#151;Other net realized investment gains for 2009 were $275 million, compared with $5 million in 2008. In October 2009, the Company sold a portion of its common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics, Inc. (Verisk) for total proceeds of approximately $184 million as part of the initial public offering (IPO) of Verisk. The Company recorded a pretax realized investment gain of $159 million on this sale in the fourth quarter of 2009. Other net realized investment gains in 2009 also included $100 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $23 million of net realized investment gains associated with the U.S. Treasury futures contracts (which require a daily mark-to-market settlement and are used to shorten the duration of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio) and $23 million of net realized investment losses related to foreign exchange. \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2008 included $50 million related to foreign currency exchange gains, $39 million from the sale of subsidiaries, $29 million from the sale of fixed maturity securities and $17 million of net realized investment gains from the sale of venture capital investments. Partially offsetting these realized investment gains in 2008 were net realized losses of $77 million related to convertible bonds wherein the embedded option price is marked to market through realized gains or losses and $53 million of losses related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts. \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2007 included $107 million of net realized investment gains generated by the venture capital portfolio (including an $81 million net realized investment gain from the bundled sale of a substantial portion of the Company's venture capital investment holdings), $63 million of net realized investment gains from the sale of a privately held security, $21 million of net realized investment gains related to the Company's holdings of stock purchase warrants of Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd., a publicly-held company, and $5 million of net realized investment gains from the Company's fixed maturity portfolio. These gains were partially offset by a net realized investment loss of $24 million related to the divestiture of a subsidiary. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nOther revenues primarily consist of premium installment charges. In 2007, other revenues also included a $39 million loss related to the Company's redemption of its 4.50% convertible junior subordinated notes in April 2007, consisting of the redemption premium paid and the write-off of remaining debt issuance costs. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Business Insurance &#160; $ 12,098 &#160; $ 12,580 &#160; $ 13,017 &#160; Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; &#160; 3,713 &#160; &#160; 3,966 &#160; &#160; 4,037 &#160; Personal Insurance &#160; &#160; 7,474 &#160; &#160; 7,291 &#160; &#160; 7,144 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 23,285 &#160; $ 23,837 &#160; $ 24,198 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Business Insurance &#160; $ 10,902 &#160; $ 11,220 &#160; $ 11,318 &#160; Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; &#160; 3,285 &#160; &#160; 3,468 &#160; &#160; 3,465 &#160; Personal Insurance &#160; &#160; 7,149 &#160; &#160; 6,995 &#160; &#160; 6,835 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 21,336 &#160; $ 21,683 &#160; $ 21,618 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2009 both decreased 2% from 2008. Overall, business retention remained at high levels in 2009. Renewal premium changes remained stable as improving rate trends offset the impact of lower coverage demands from existing policyholders due to general economic conditions. New business volume declined slightly from 2008, as modest growth in the Business Insurance segment was offset by lower new business volume in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance and Personal Insurance segments. In Business Insurance, net written premiums in 2009 declined 3% from 2008, driven by lower levels of economic activity in recent quarters that impacted exposure changes at renewal, audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. In Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance, net written premiums in 2009 decreased 5% from 2008, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of the economic downturn on construction surety business volume. In the Personal Insurance segment, net written premiums in 2009 increased 2% over 2008, reflecting continued strong retention rates and renewal premium increases, particularly in the Homeowners and Other line of business. \n\nAfianzadora Insurgentes and Mendota generated combined gross and net written premiums of $79 million and $74 million, respectively, in 2007, prior to their sale. Adjusting for the sale of these operations in 2007, gross written premiums in 2008 declined 1% and net written premiums in 2008 increased by less than 1% compared with 2007. In the Business Insurance segment, net written premiums decreased by 1% from 2007, despite strong business retention rates. Premium growth in Industry-Focused Underwriting, Select Accounts and Commercial Accounts in 2008, which was generally driven by strong business retention rates and new business volume, was largely offset by premium declines in National Accounts, Target Risk Underwriting and Specialized Distribution which primarily resulted from declines in renewal price changes and new business. Net written premiums in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment adjusted for the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes increased by 1% over 2007, largely driven by changes in the terms of certain reinsurance treaties that resulted in a higher level of business retained in the Bond &#38; Financial Products group. In the Personal Insurance segment, net written premiums in 2008 adjusted for the sale of Mendota increased 3% over 2007, reflecting continued strong retention rates, renewal price increases and growth in new business levels. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses totaled $12.41 billion in 2009, $585 million, or 5%, lower than the 2008 total of $12.99 billion, primarily reflecting a decline in the cost of catastrophes, lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and fewer large property losses, mostly offset by a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and the impact of loss cost trends. Total claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 included $457 million for the cost of catastrophes and $1.33 billion of net favorable prior year reserve development, whereas the comparable 2008 total included $1.26 billion for the cost of catastrophes and $1.54 billion of net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail storms, as well as flooding. Catastrophe losses in 2008 primarily resulted from Hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Dolly. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses totaled $12.99 billion in 2008, $596 million, or 5%, higher than the 2007 total of $12.40 billion, primarily reflecting a significant increase in the cost of catastrophes, an increase in the number of large losses that exceeded expectations, an increase in non-catastrophe related weather losses in Personal Insurance and the impact of loss cost trends. These factors were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $1.26 billion, primarily resulting from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, as well as wind, rain and hail storms in several regions of the United States throughout the year. The cost of catastrophes in 2007 totaled $167 million, primarily resulting from wildfires in California and several wind, rain and hail storms throughout the United States. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008 totaled $1.54 billion, compared with $546 million of net favorable prior year reserve development in 2007. \n\nNet favorable prior year reserve development of $1.33 billion in 2009 reflected greater reductions in frequency than the Company expected based upon long-term frequency trends that have been declining. In the Business Insurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development of $1.03 billion resulted from better than expected loss development for recent accident years in the general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial property product lines, partially offset by increases to asbestos and environmental reserves of $185 million and $70 million, respectively (which are discussed in more detail in the \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" sections herein). Net favorable prior year reserve development in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment totaled $168 million, driven by better than expected loss experience in the International group&#151;particularly in the United Kingdom, several lines of business at Lloyd's and in the surety line of business in Canada&#151;and in the contract surety line of business in the Bond &#38; Financial Products group. In the Personal Insurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development of $135 million was driven by better than expected loss experience related to Hurricanes Katrina and Ike and the 2007 California wildfires. \n\nThe Company's three business segments each experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008. Net favorable prior year reserve development of $1.12 billion in the Business Insurance segment was driven by better than expected loss results primarily concentrated in the general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial property and commercial automobile product lines, partially offset by increases in workers' compensation reserves and $70 million and $85 million increases in asbestos and environmental reserves, respectively. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development of $274 million was concentrated in the International group, particularly in the public and products liability (general liability), professional indemnity (professional liability) and property lines of business in the United Kingdom, the general liability line of business in Canada, and the Aviation and Property lines of business at Lloyd's. In the Personal Insurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development of $143 million in 2008 was primarily driven by favorable loss experience related to Hurricane Katrina as \n\nwell as better than expected loss experience in certain lines of business within the Homeowners and Other product line. \n\nEach of the Company's three business segments also experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2007. In Business Insurance, net favorable prior year reserve development of $301 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss development for recent accident years in the commercial multi-peril, general liability, commercial automobile and property product lines. Net prior year reserve development in 2007 in the Business Insurance segment included a $185 million increase to environmental reserves. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development of $93 million in 2007 primarily reflected better than expected loss development in international property, employers' liability, professional indemnity and motor lines of business for recent accident years. In the Personal Insurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development of $152 million in 2007 occurred in both the Automobile and Homeowners and Other lines of business. \n\nFactors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment in 2009, 2008 and 2007 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nIn 2009, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $3.81 billion, 2% lower than the total of $3.88 billion in 2008. The decline in 2009 was consistent with the decline in earned premiums. \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $3.88 billion in 2008, $174 million, or 5%, higher than the comparable 2007 total of $3.71 billion. The growth in amortization costs in 2008 primarily reflected the higher level of amortized commission expense resulting from the Company's implementation of a new fixed agent compensation program in 2007, described in more detail below. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $3.37 billion in 2009, a decrease of $152 million, or 4%, from the comparable 2008 total of $3.52 billion. The decrease resulted from estimates of windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike. During 2008, the Company recorded $141 million of hurricane-related assessments in general and administrative expenses. Subsequently, during the first half of 2009, the Company recorded an $87 million reduction in these estimated assessments due to a decline in estimated insurance industry losses related to Hurricane Ike. Adjusting for the impact of windpool assessments in both 2009 and 2008, general and administrative expenses in 2009 increased 2% over 2008. The increase reflected the impact of continued investments to support business growth and product development, including the Company's direct to consumer initiative in the Personal Insurance segment, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on expenses in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $3.52 billion in 2008, an increase of $166 million, or 5%, over the comparable 2007 total of $3.35 billion. This increase primarily reflected the impact of $141 million of hurricane-related assessments. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2007, the Company discontinued the use of contingent commissions and implemented a new fixed agent compensation program for all of its personal insurance business. The Company also offered the majority of its agents conducting commercial insurance business the option to switch to this new program. The Company's total payout rate for all agent compensation for 2007 was substantially the same as for 2006; however, the change to the new program created a difference in the timing of commission expense recognition. The cost of the new program is required to be deferred and amortized over the related policy period (generally six to twelve months), whereas the cost of the contingent commission program was not subject to deferred acquisition cost accounting treatment and, \n\ntherefore, was expensed as incurred. That timing difference resulted in a benefit to income during the 2007 transition year. The impact of this change in 2007 was to lower reported expenses by $376 million in the \"General and Administrative Expenses\" income statement line, and increase reported expenses by $213 million in the \"Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\" income statement line, compared to what would have been reported under the prior contingent commission program. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $382 million, $370 million and $346 million, respectively. The increases in 2009 and 2008 over the respective prior year primarily reflected higher average levels of debt outstanding. \n\nEffective Tax Rate \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 23.1%, 21.3% and 26.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in the effective rate in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as the decrease in the effective rate in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from changes in income before taxes between the three years and the proportion of tax-exempt investment income in each year. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratios \n\nThe consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.3% in 2009 was 2.1 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.4% in 2008. The cost of catastrophes accounted for 2.1 points of the 2009 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, whereas the 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio included a 5.8 point impact from the cost of catastrophes. The 2009 and 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios included 6.2 point and 7.1 point benefits from net favorable prior year reserve development, respectively. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio adjusted for catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development in 2009 was 0.7 points higher than the 2008 ratio on the same basis. The higher ratio in 2009 primarily reflected reduced underwriting margins related to pricing and loss cost trends in several lines of business, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and fewer large property losses. \n\nIn 2009, the underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% was 0.6 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.5% in 2008. The underwriting expense ratio in 2009 included a 0.4 point benefit from the reduction in the estimate of windpool assessments described above, whereas the underwriting expense ratio in 2008 included a 0.7 point increase due to the impact of the windpool assessments. Adjusting for these factors in both years, the underwriting expense ratio for 2009 was 0.5 points higher than the respective 2008 underwriting expense ratio, primarily reflecting the impact of continued investments to support business growth and product development, including the Company's direct to consumer initiative in the Personal Insurance segment, as well as salary increases in the normal course of business. \n\nThe consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.4% for 2008 was 2.8 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 56.6% in 2007. The cost of catastrophes accounted for 5.8 points of the 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, whereas the 2007 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio included a 0.7 point impact from catastrophe losses. The 2008 and 2007 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios included 7.1 point and 2.5 point benefits, respectively, from net favorable prior year reserve development. The 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio adjusted for the cost of catastrophes and prior year reserve development was 2.3 points higher than the respective 2007 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing, a small increase in the number of large losses, non-catastrophe weather related losses and loss cost trends. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 32.5% in 2008 was 1.7 points higher than the 2007 underwriting expense ratio of 30.8%. The 2008 expense ratio included a 0.7 point increase due to the impact of the hurricane-related assessments, whereas the 2007 ratio included a 0.8 point benefit from the implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program described above. Adjusting for these factors in both years, the adjusted 2008 expense ratio was 0.2 points higher than the adjusted expense ratio in 2007, reflecting continued investments to support business growth and product development, as well as salary increases in the normal course of business. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT \n\nBusiness Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Business Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 10,968 &#160; $ 11,180 &#160; $ 11,283 &#160; &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 1,902 &#160; &#160; 1,917 &#160; &#160; 2,708 &#160; &#160; Fee income &#160; &#160; 306 &#160; &#160; 390 &#160; &#160; 508 &#160; &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 42 &#160; &#160; 30 &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues &#160; $ 13,218 &#160; $ 13,517 &#160; $ 14,523 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 9,778 &#160; $ 10,506 &#160; $ 10,444 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating income &#160; $ 2,590 &#160; $ 2,338 &#160; $ 3,015 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 53.9 % &#160; 57.7 % &#160; 57.1 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 32.2 &#160; &#160; 32.5 &#160; &#160; 30.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 86.1 % &#160; 90.2 % &#160; 87.8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nIn 2009, operating income totaled $2.59 billion, an increase of $252 million, or 11%, over the comparable 2008 total of $2.34 billion. The increase in operating income in 2009 primarily reflected a decline in the cost of catastrophes, which was partially offset by reduced underwriting margins and fee income. The cost of catastrophes in 2009 and 2008 totaled $176 million and $706 million, respectively. The 2008 total was principally comprised of $642 million of claims and claim adjustment expenses and $62 million of property windpool assessments that were included in general and administrative expenses. Net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $1.03 billion and $1.12 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income in 2009 also included a benefit of $42 million from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters and a $38 million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike that had been recorded in general and administrative expenses in 2008. \n\nOperating income of $2.34 billion in 2008 was $677 million, or 22%, lower than operating income of $3.02 billion in 2007, primarily due to a significant decline in net investment income and an increase in the cost of catastrophes. Also contributing to this reduction were a decline in fee income, the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing, the impact of loss cost trends, and a small increase in the number of large property losses. A significant increase in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008 partially offset these factors. The cost of catastrophes in 2008 totaled $706 million, compared with $4 million in 2007. Net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $1.12 billion and $301 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating income in 2008 included an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of Unionamerica. Operating income in 2007 benefited by $81 million from \n\nthe Company's implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program and the resolution of various prior year tax matters. \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums of $10.97 billion in 2009 decreased $212 million, or 2%, from 2008. The decline in 2009 was primarily attributable to reduced insured exposures due to lower levels of economic activity. Earned premiums of $11.18 billion in 2008 decreased $103 million, or 1%, from 2007, reflecting the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing and new business. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nRefer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the decline in the Company's net investment income in 2009 and 2008 as compared with the prior year. \n\nFee Income \n\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. The $84 million decline in fee income in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily resulted from lower serviced premium and claim volume due to the de-population of workers' compensation residual market pools, the impact on fee income related to both lower claim volume and lower loss costs (as fees are based either on the number of claims serviced or as a percentage of losses) driven by workers' compensation reforms and overall lower claim frequency during the preceding twelve months. Lower new business volume over the preceding twelve months, due to lower levels of economic activity and increased competition, also contributed to the decline in fee income in 2009. In 2008, the $118 million decline in fee income compared with 2007 primarily resulted from the same factors causing the decline in 2009. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $6.04 billion, a decrease of $571 million, or 9%, compared with 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflected a decline in the cost of catastrophes, partially offset by the impact of loss cost trends and a slight decline in net favorable prior year reserve development. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $176 million, compared with $642 million in 2008. Catastrophe losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail storms, as well as flooding. In 2008, Hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Dolly, and other wind, rain and hail storms in several regions of the United States accounted for the majority of catastrophe losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 and 2008 totaled $1.03 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. The 2009 total was driven by better than expected loss results primarily concentrated in the general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial property product lines for recent accident years, reflecting greater reductions in frequency than the Company expected based upon long-term frequency trends that have been declining. The general liability and commercial multi-peril product lines experienced better than anticipated loss development that was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The commercial automobile line of business experienced better than expected loss development that was attributable to more favorable legal and judicial environments, claim handling initiatives and improvements in auto safety technology. The commercial property product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2007 and 2008 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. In addition, the commercial property product line's 2005 accident year \n\nexperience improved due to the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. The net favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2009 was partially offset by a $185 million increase to asbestos reserves (discussed in more detail in the \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" section herein), a $70 million increase to environmental reserves recorded in the second quarter (discussed in more detail in the \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" section herein). \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $6.61 billion, an increase of $65 million, or 1%, over 2007, primarily reflecting a significant increase in the cost of catastrophes, a small increase in the number of large property losses and the impact of loss cost trends, which were largely offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $642 million, compared with $4 million in 2007. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008 and 2007 totaled $1.12 billion and $301 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year development in 2008 was driven by better than expected loss results primarily concentrated in the general liability and commercial multi-peril product lines, an increase in anticipated ceded reinsurance recoveries for older accident years in the general liability product line and better than anticipated loss development in the commercial property and commercial automobile product lines. The net favorable prior year reserve development in the general liability and commercial multi-peril lines was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The commercial property product line improvement occurred primarily in the 2007 accident year as a result of better than expected loss development for certain large national property, national programs, and ocean marine claim exposures and lower than expected weather-related losses during the last half of 2007, as well as favorable loss development in certain large inland marine claim exposures and in ceded reinsurance recoveries for commercial property large claims. In addition, the commercial multi-peril and property product lines' 2005 accident year results experienced improvement due to the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. The commercial automobile product line improvement was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The net favorable prior year reserve development in the foregoing product lines in 2008 was partially offset by net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the workers' compensation product line, primarily driven by higher than anticipated medical costs related to 2004 and prior accident years, and by $70 million and $85 million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves, respectively (discussed in more detail in the \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" sections herein). \n\nNet favorable prior year reserve development of $301 million in 2007 was primarily driven by better than expected loss development for recent accident years in the commercial multi-peril, general liability, commercial automobile and property product lines. The commercial multi-peril and general liability product lines experienced better than anticipated loss development that was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The commercial automobile product line experienced better than expected loss development due to more favorable legal and judicial environments, claim handling initiatives focused on the automobile line of insurance and improvements in auto safety technology. The property product line experienced fewer than expected late reported claims related to non-catastrophe weather events that occurred late in 2006, as well as better than expected frequency and severity due in part to changes in the marketplace, such as higher deductibles and lower policy limits. In addition, the property product line experienced better than expected large loss outcomes which were partially attributable to favorable litigation resolutions. Net total prior year reserve development in 2007 included a $185 million increase to environmental reserves (discussed in more detail in the \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" section herein). \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $1.78 billion in 2009, $43 million lower than the comparable total of $1.82 billion in 2008. The decline was consistent with the declines in earned premiums. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $1.82 billion in 2008, $76 million, or 4%, higher than the comparable total of $1.74 billion in 2007. The growth in amortization costs primarily reflected the higher level of amortized commission expense in 2008 resulting from the Company's implementation of a new fixed agent compensation program in 2007. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2009 totaled $1.97 billion, $113 million lower than the comparable 2008 total of $2.08 billion. The majority of the decrease reflected the impact of estimates of windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike in each year. During 2008, the Company recorded $62 million of hurricane-related assessments in general and administrative expenses. Subsequently, during the first half of 2009, the Company recorded a $38 million reduction in these assessments due to a decline in estimated insurance industry losses related to Hurricane Ike. General and administrative expenses totaled $2.08 billion in 2008, an increase of $51 million, or 3%, over the comparable 2007 total of $2.03 billion. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected the impact of hurricane-related assessments. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratio \n\nIn 2009, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 53.9% was 3.8 points lower than the comparable 2008 ratio of 57.7%. The cost of catastrophes in 2009 and 2008 accounted for 1.6 points and 5.7 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 9.3 point and 10.0 point benefits to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2009 adjusted for the cost of catastrophes and prior year reserve development was 0.4 points lower than the 2008 ratio on the same basis, due to lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and fewer large property losses, partially offset by reduced underwriting margins related to pricing and loss cost trends. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2008 of 57.7% was 0.6 points higher than the comparable 2007 ratio of 57.1%. The cost of catastrophes accounted for 5.7 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2008, compared with no impact from catastrophes in 2007. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 10.0 point and 2.6 point benefits to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio adjusted for the cost of catastrophes and prior year reserve development was 2.3 points higher than the 2007 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing over the preceding twelve months and loss cost trends, as well as a small increase in the number of large property losses. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2009 was 0.3 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.5% in 2008. The 2009 underwriting expense ratio included a 0.3 point benefit from the reduction in the estimate of windpool assessments described above, whereas the underwriting expense ratio in 2008 included a 0.6 point increase due to the impact from the windpool assessments and reinstatement premiums. Adjusting for these factors in both years, the underwriting expense ratio for 2009 was 0.6 points higher than the 2008 underwriting expense ratio. The adjusted underwriting expense ratio in 2009 reflected the unfavorable impact of the decline in fee income compared with the same periods of 2008. A portion of fee income is accounted for as a reduction of expenses for purposes of calculating the expense ratio. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 32.5% in 2008 was 1.8 points higher than the comparable 2007 ratio of 30.7%. The 2008 expense ratio included a 0.6 point impact of the hurricane-related assessments, whereas the 2007 ratio included a 0.7 point benefit from the implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program described in the \"Consolidated Overview\" section herein. Adjusting for these factors in both years, the adjusted 2008 expense ratio was 0.5 points higher than the adjusted \n\nexpense ratio for 2007, primarily reflecting continued investments to support business growth and product development, the impact of a decline in the rate of earned premium growth relative to expense growth, and declines in fee income. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nThe Business Insurance segment's gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Select Accounts &#160; $ 2,804 &#160; $ 2,804 &#160; $ 2,774 &#160; Commercial Accounts &#160; &#160; 2,687 &#160; &#160; 2,729 &#160; &#160; 2,740 &#160; National Accounts &#160; &#160; 1,321 &#160; &#160; 1,577 &#160; &#160; 1,859 &#160; Industry-Focused Underwriting &#160; &#160; 2,363 &#160; &#160; 2,485 &#160; &#160; 2,380 &#160; Target Risk Underwriting &#160; &#160; 2,014 &#160; &#160; 2,029 &#160; &#160; 2,182 &#160; Specialized Distribution &#160; &#160; 901 &#160; &#160; 954 &#160; &#160; 1,033 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance Core &#160; &#160; 12,090 &#160; &#160; 12,578 &#160; &#160; 12,968 &#160; Business Insurance Other &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance &#160; $ 12,098 &#160; $ 12,580 &#160; $ 13,017 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Select Accounts &#160; $ 2,756 &#160; $ 2,756 &#160; $ 2,711 &#160; Commercial Accounts &#160; &#160; 2,493 &#160; &#160; 2,524 &#160; &#160; 2,518 &#160; National Accounts &#160; &#160; 902 &#160; &#160; 996 &#160; &#160; 1,056 &#160; Industry-Focused Underwriting &#160; &#160; 2,279 &#160; &#160; 2,396 &#160; &#160; 2,301 &#160; Target Risk Underwriting &#160; &#160; 1,568 &#160; &#160; 1,593 &#160; &#160; 1,665 &#160; Specialized Distribution &#160; &#160; 889 &#160; &#160; 939 &#160; &#160; 1,015 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance Core &#160; &#160; 10,887 &#160; &#160; 11,204 &#160; &#160; 11,266 &#160; Business Insurance Other &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; 52 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance &#160; $ 10,902 &#160; $ 11,220 &#160; $ 11,318 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn Business Insurance Core, gross and net written premiums in 2009 decreased by 4% and 3% from 2008, respectively. The decline in gross and net written premiums in 2009 was driven in large part by lower levels of economic activity in recent quarters that impacted exposure changes at renewal, audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. \n\nIn Business Insurance Core, gross and net written premiums in 2008 decreased by 3% and 1% from 2007, respectively. The difference in rates of decline between gross and net written premiums in 2008 was concentrated in National Accounts, where a significant portion of gross written premiums is ceded to other insurers and residual market pools. As a result, the decline in gross written premiums did not have a proportional impact on net written premiums. Net written premium growth in the Industry-Focused Underwriting, Select Accounts and Commercial Accounts groups generally reflected higher business retention levels and new business volume in several business units within these groups. This was more than offset by premium declines in Specialized Distribution, Target Risk Underwriting and National Accounts. \n\nSelect Accounts. Net written premiums of $2.76 billion in 2009 were level with 2008. Business retention rates remained strong, but declined slightly from the prior year. Renewal premium changes were positive in 2009 and increased over 2008. New business volume in 2009 increased slightly over \n\n2008, driven by the continued success of the Company's quote-to-issue agency platform and multivariate pricing program for smaller businesses, partially offset by lower business volumes in larger, more complex accounts served by this market. \n\nNet written premiums of $2.76 billion in 2008 increased 2% over 2007. Business retention rates in 2008 remained strong and were consistent with 2007. Renewal price changes remained positive and were comparable to 2007. In the aggregate, new business volume in 2008 increased over 2007. The Company experienced a favorable impact on its new business volume from its enhanced quote-to-issue agency platform and multivariate pricing program for smaller businesses served by Select Accounts. However, new business volume for larger accounts in 2008 declined from 2007 primarily due to competitive market conditions. \n\nCommercial Accounts. In 2009, net written premiums of $2.49 billion were 1% lower than in 2008. Business retention rates in 2009 remained strong but declined slightly from the prior year. Renewal premium changes were slightly negative in 2009 but were improved over 2008, as the impact of a continued improving rate trend was partially offset by the impact on written premiums of lower coverage demands from existing policyholders due to general economic conditions. New business levels increased when compared with 2008 due to various product and customer initiatives. \n\nNet written premiums of $2.52 billion in 2008 were virtually level with the 2007 total. Business retention rates in 2008 remained strong and were higher than in 2007. Renewal price changes were slightly negative in 2008, and were lower than in 2007. New business levels also declined when compared with 2007, reflecting competitive market conditions in this market. \n\nNational Accounts. In 2009, net written premiums of $902 million were 9% lower than in 2008. The decline in net written premiums in 2009 was driven by the loss of a large account, negative renewal premium changes resulting from lower coverage demands from existing policyholders due to general economic conditions, and lower premium volume from property and workers' compensation involuntary residual markets. Despite the impact of the loss of a large account, business retention rates remained high in 2009. \n\nNet written premiums of $1.00 billion in 2008 decreased 6% from 2007. The decline primarily reflected a significant decline in renewal price changes, as prices charged for National Accounts' products are adjusted for actual loss performance, which continued to be favorable due to workers' compensation reforms. Overall new business volume increased slightly over 2007. Business retention rates in 2008 remained strong and increased over 2007. \n\nIndustry-Focused Underwriting. In 2009, net written premiums of $2.28 billion declined 5% from 2008. Premium declines were concentrated in the Construction and Oil &#38; Gas business units, reflecting economic conditions in these industries. In addition, premium volume in the Technology and Public Sector business units declined, reflecting economic conditions and competitive market pressures. These declines were partially offset by premium growth in the Agribusiness business unit in 2009. \n\nNet written premiums of $2.40 billion in 2008 increased 4% over 2007. All business units in this market recorded net written premium growth in 2008. Growth in Construction net written premiums in 2008 was driven by strong business retention levels coupled with continued strong new business volume. An increase in new business volume was the primary factor in the growth in net written premiums in the Oil &#38; Gas business unit. In Agribusiness, net written premium growth was driven by increases in business retention rates and renewal price changes. In the Public Sector business unit, the increase in net written premiums was driven by higher new business volume coupled with continued strong business retention rates. \n\nTarget Risk Underwriting. In 2009, net written premiums of $1.57 billion were 2% lower than in 2008, primarily due to the Inland Marine and Ocean Marine business units, reflecting the impact of \n\ngeneral economic conditions and a decline in new business volume. Partially offsetting the declines in these business units was strong growth in National Property premium volume in 2009 due to significant increases in renewal premium changes. Excess Casualty written premiums also increased over 2008, due to a change in the terms of certain reinsurance treaties that resulted in a higher level of business retained. \n\nNet written premiums of $1.59 billion in 2008 decreased 4% from 2007. The decline was concentrated in the National Property business unit, reflecting reductions in renewal price changes and new business volume due to competitive market conditions, and in the Inland Marine business unit, primarily reflecting reductions in business retention rates and new business volume due to general economic conditions. In addition, the Global Accounts business unit experienced a reduction in net written premiums due to declines in business retention rates, renewal price changes and new business. Partially offsetting the declines in these business units was an increase in net written premiums in the Excess Casualty business unit, where renewal price changes remained negative but improved over 2007 and business retention levels increased. \n\nSpecialized Distribution. In 2009, net written premiums of $889 million were 5% lower than in 2008. The decline was attributable to both the National Programs and Northland business units, which experienced continued negative renewal premium changes that reflected competitive market conditions and the impact of economic conditions, primarily on the commercial trucking, entertainment and leisure industries. \n\nNet written premiums of $939 million in 2008 decreased 7% from 2007. The premium decline reflected negative renewal price changes in both the Northland and National Programs business units. In the National Programs business unit, business retention rates increased over 2007, but new business levels declined compared with 2007. In the Northland business unit, business retention rates and new business levels remained strong, but were down slightly compared with 2007. \n\nFinancial, Professional &#38; International Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 3,333 &#160; $ 3,429 &#160; $ 3,384 &#160; &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 452 &#160; &#160; 454 &#160; &#160; 494 &#160; &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues &#160; $ 3,812 &#160; $ 3,907 &#160; $ 3,907 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 2,948 &#160; $ 3,004 &#160; $ 2,981 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating income &#160; $ 642 &#160; $ 649 &#160; $ 675 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 52.1 % &#160; 51.2 % &#160; 50.8 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 36.0 &#160; &#160; 36.0 &#160; &#160; 36.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 88.1 % &#160; 87.2 % &#160; 87.6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nIn 2009, operating income of $642 million was $7 million, or 1%, lower than in 2008. A reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development was largely offset by a decline in the cost of catastrophes and lower large losses in the International group. Net favorable prior year reserve \n\ndevelopment totaled $168 million and $274 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The cost of catastrophes totaled $3 million and $84 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\nOperating income of $649 million in 2008 decreased by $26 million, or 4%, from 2007. The decline in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in the number of large losses that exceeded expectations within the International group, an increase in the cost of catastrophes and a decline in net investment income, largely offset by a significant increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. The cost of catastrophes in 2008 was $84 million, compared with no catastrophe losses in 2007. Net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $274 and $93 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. \n\nIn March 2007, the Company completed the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes, which accounted for $25 million of net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007. The impact of this transaction was not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position. \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums of $3.33 billion in 2009 declined $96 million, or 3%, from the 2008 total due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Adjusting for the impact of exchange rates, earned premiums in this segment were slightly higher than in 2008, primarily reflecting growth in the International group. Earned premiums of $3.43 billion in 2008 increased $45 million, or 1%, over the 2007 total of $3.38 billion. Adjusting for the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes in 2007, earned premium growth of 2% in 2008 was concentrated in the Construction Services business unit of the Bond &#38; Financial Products group due to changes in the terms of certain reinsurance treaties that resulted in a higher level of business retained. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nThe slight decline in net investment income in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which reduced reported net investment income by approximately $18 million in 2009. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the change in the Company's net investment income in 2009 and 2008 as compared with the respective prior years, as well as a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $1.75 billion, a decrease of $22 million, or 1%, from 2008. The decrease in 2009 was driven by a $73 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. A decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development was largely offset by declines in the cost of catastrophes and large losses in the International group. Net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $168 million and $274 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 was driven by better than expected loss experience in the International group, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the Surety line of business in Canada. In addition, the Aviation and Property lines of business at Lloyd's experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009. In the Bond &#38; Financial Products group, better than expected loss experience for the contract surety business within the fidelity and surety product line for recent accident years also resulted in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $3 million, compared with $73 million in 2008. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses of $1.77 billion in 2008 increased by $32 million, or 2%, over 2007. An increase in the cost of catastrophes and an increase in the number of large losses that exceeded expectations within International in 2008 were largely offset by a significant increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim \n\nadjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $73 million, compared with no catastrophe losses in 2007. Hurricanes Ike and Gustav accounted for the majority of catastrophe losses in 2008. \n\nNet favorable prior year reserve development totaled $274 million in 2008, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the International group. The improvements in longer-tail lines of business were attributable to several factors, including enhanced risk control and underwriting strategies throughout the International group. In the property line of business, the improvement primarily resulted from better than anticipated loss development in the United Kingdom, in part due to favorable claim activity relating to 2007 flood losses. In the Bond &#38; Financial Products group, better than expected loss experience for the contract surety business within the fidelity and surety product line, resulting from favorable settlements on large claims (primarily from accident years prior to 2005), resulted in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008. In 2007, net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $93 million, primarily reflecting better than expected loss development in international property, employers' liability, professional indemnity and motor lines of business for recent accident years, which was attributable to several factors, including enhanced pricing and underwriting strategies throughout the International operations, and the favorable impact of legal and judicial reforms in Ireland. \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $622 million in 2009, $30 million, or 5%, lower than the comparable 2008 total of $652 million. The declines were driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the mix of business. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2009 totaled $579 million, slightly lower than $581 million in 2008. The decline in 2009 primarily reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which was largely offset by an increase in employee-related expenses associated with growth initiatives. General and administrative expenses in 2008 were $9 million lower than in 2007, primarily reflecting a decrease in commission expense. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratio \n\nIn 2009, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 52.1% was 0.9 points higher than the ratio of 51.2% in 2008. The 2009 ratio included a 5.1 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and a 0.1 point impact from the cost of catastrophes, whereas the 2008 ratio included an 8.0 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and a 2.3 point impact from the cost of catastrophes. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2009 adjusted for the cost of catastrophes and prior year reserve development was 0.2 points higher than the 2008 ratio on the same basis, as the impact of loss cost trends was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower large losses in the International group. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 36.0% for 2009 was level with the underwriting expense ratio in 2008. The 2008 expense ratio included a 0.2 point impact from hurricane-related assessments. Adjusting for that factor in 2008, the 2009 underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 points higher than the 2008 ratio. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 51.2% in 2008 was 0.4 points higher than the 2007 ratio of 50.8%. The 2008 ratio included an 8.0 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and a 2.3 point impact from the cost of catastrophes, whereas the 2007 ratio included a 2.7 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and no impact from catastrophe losses. The 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio adjusted for catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 3.4 points higher than the 2007 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of large losses that exceeded expectations within International. The underwriting expense ratio of 36.0% in 2008 was 0.8 points lower than in 2007. The 2008 expense ratio included a 0.2 point impact of hurricane-related assessments. Adjusting for these assessments, the 2008 expense ratio was 1.0 points lower than the expense ratio in 2007, reflecting reduced acquisition costs. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nFinancial, Professional &#38; International Insurance gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Bond &#38; Financial Products &#160; $ 2,262 &#160; $ 2,378 &#160; $ 2,480 &#160; International &#160; &#160; 1,451 &#160; &#160; 1,588 &#160; &#160; 1,557 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; $ 3,713 &#160; $ 3,966 &#160; $ 4,037 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Bond &#38; Financial Products &#160; $ 2,040 &#160; $ 2,126 &#160; $ 2,123 &#160; International &#160; &#160; 1,245 &#160; &#160; 1,342 &#160; &#160; 1,342 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; $ 3,285 &#160; $ 3,468 &#160; $ 3,465 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment's gross written premiums of $3.71 billion in 2009 decreased 6% from 2008, and net written premiums of $3.29 billion in 2009 decreased 5% from 2008. The decline in gross and net written premiums was primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in the International group. The remainder of the decline was driven by the impact of the economic downturn on construction surety business volume and underwriting actions taken in the professional liability component of Bond &#38; Financial Products' management liability business, partially offset by growth in Ireland. \n\nIn the Bond &#38; Financial Products group (excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures), business retention rates remained strong but decreased from 2008, primarily in professional liability. Renewal premium changes in 2009 increased slightly over 2008, as the impact of slight positive renewal rate changes on written premiums was largely offset by reduced insured exposures due to underwriting actions and lower levels of economic activity. New business levels in 2009 were lower than in 2008. \n\nIn the International group (excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures), business retention rates in 2009 declined from 2008, primarily due to underwriting actions taken in the United Kingdom, Ireland and at the Company's operations at Lloyd's. Renewal premium changes improved over 2008 and new business levels declined when compared with 2008. \n\nAfianzadora Insurgentes generated gross and net written premiums of $30 million and $25 million, respectively, in 2007. Adjusting for the sale of that operation in 2007, gross written premiums in 2008 declined 1% from 2007, whereas net written premiums increased 1% over 2007. The difference in 2008 gross and net written premium growth rates primarily reflected changes in the terms of certain of the Company's reinsurance treaties that resulted in a higher level of business retained in the Bond &#38; Financial Products group. \n\nIn the Bond &#38; Financial Products group, net written premiums in 2008 increased 1% over 2007 (adjusted for the sale of Afianzadora Insurgentes), as the impact of the higher level of business retained in 2008 was largely offset by a decline in premium volume due to competitive market conditions and the economic downturn. In the Bond &#38; Financial Products group (excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures), business retention rates in 2008 remained strong and increased slightly over 2007. Renewal price changes in 2008 were slightly negative, compared to an increase in the prior year, and new business levels were consistent with 2007. \n\nNet written premiums in the International group in 2008 were flat with 2007. For the International group in 2008, business retention rates declined from 2007 due to the intentional non-renewal of certain property business in Canada and more competitive market conditions at Lloyd's. Renewal price changes in 2008 were flat, compared to a decrease in 2007, and new business volume increased. \n\nPersonal Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Personal Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 7,117 &#160; $ 6,970 &#160; $ 6,803 &#160; &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 422 &#160; &#160; 421 &#160; &#160; 559 &#160; &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#160; 75 &#160; &#160; 90 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues &#160; $ 7,623 &#160; $ 7,466 &#160; $ 7,452 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 6,824 &#160; $ 6,855 &#160; $ 5,996 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating income &#160; $ 601 &#160; $ 465 &#160; $ 1,019 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 65.0 % &#160; 66.2 % &#160; 58.6 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 29.6 &#160; &#160; 30.8 &#160; &#160; 28.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 94.6 % &#160; 97.0 % &#160; 86.8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative on GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 1.7 % &#160; 0.5 % &#160; &#151; % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nIn 2009, operating income of $601 million was $136 million, or 29%, higher than in 2008, driven by a decline in the cost of catastrophes and a reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments, partially offset by investments in the direct to consumer initiative and loss cost trends. The cost of catastrophes in 2009 totaled $278 million, compared with $618 million in 2008. The 2008 total was comprised of $541 million of claims and claim adjustment expenses and $77 million of property windpool assessments that were included in general and administrative expenses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 and 2008 totaled $135 million and $143 million, respectively. \n\nOperating income of $465 million in 2008 was $554 million, or 54%, lower than operating income in 2007, primarily reflecting an increase in the cost of catastrophes. Also contributing to the decline in 2008 were a reduction in net investment income, an increase in non-catastrophe related weather losses and loss cost trends. The cost of catastrophes in 2008 totaled $618 million, compared with $163 million in 2007. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008 and 2007 totaled $143 million and $152 million, respectively. In addition, results in 2007 benefited by $71 million from the Company's implementation of a new fixed agent compensation program. \n\nIn April 2007, the Company completed the sale of its subsidiary, Mendota Insurance Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mendakota Insurance Company and Mendota Insurance Agency, Inc. (collectively, Mendota). These subsidiaries primarily offered nonstandard automobile coverage and accounted for $49 million of net written premiums in the year ended December 31, 2007. The impact of this transaction was not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position. \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nIn 2009, earned premiums of $7.12 billion were $147 million, or 2%, higher than in 2008. The increase reflected continued strong business retention rates and new business levels, and renewal \n\npremium increases. Earned premiums of $6.97 billion in 2008 increased $167 million, or 2%, over earned premiums of $6.80 billion in 2007. Adjusting for the sale of Mendota in 2007, earned premiums in 2008 increased 3% over 2007. The increase reflected continued strong business retention rates and new business volume, coupled with continued renewal price increases. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nRefer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the change in the Company's net investment income in 2009 and 2008 as compared with the prior year. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nIn 2009, claims and claim adjustment expenses of $4.62 billion were slightly higher than in 2008, as the impacts of loss cost trends and increased business volume were largely offset by the decline in the cost of catastrophes. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2009 totaled $278 million, compared with $541 million in 2008. Catastrophe losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail storms, as well as flooding. Catastrophe losses in 2008 primarily resulted from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, as well as tornado, wind and hail storms in various regions of the United States throughout the year. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 totaled $135 million, compared with $143 million in 2008. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 primarily reflected favorable loss experience related to Hurricanes Ike and Katrina, as well as the 2007 California wildfires. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $4.62 billion, an increase of $629 million, or 16%, over 2007, primarily reflecting a significant increase in the cost of catastrophes, non-catastrophe weather related losses in the Homeowners and Other product line, the impact of loss cost trends and increased business volume. The cost of catastrophes included in claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2008 totaled $541 million, compared with $163 million in 2007. Catastrophe losses in 2008 primarily resulted from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, as well as tornado, wind and hail storms in various regions of the United States throughout the year. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2008 and 2007 totaled $143 million and $152 million, respectively. The 2008 net favorable prior year reserve development was primarily driven by favorable loss experience related to Hurricane Katrina, and better than expected loss experience from recent accident years for the Homeowners and Other product line. This improvement was driven in part by claim initiatives as well as better than expected outcomes on 2007 catastrophe-related claims. In addition, the Homeowners and Other product line experienced improvement in older accident years for the umbrella line as well as favorable experience from accident year 2007 for allied coverages due to less than expected claim activity. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2007 of $152 million was driven by better than expected automobile loss experience due in part to claim initiatives and fewer than expected late reported homeowners' claims related to non-catastrophe weather events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, a portion of net favorable prior year reserve development in the Homeowners and Other line of business in 2007 was attributable to a decrease in the number of claims due to changes in the marketplace, including higher deductibles and fewer small-dollar claims. \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $1.42 billion in 2009, compared with $1.41 billion in 2008, consistent with earned premium levels in both years. \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $1.41 billion in 2008, compared with $1.31 billion in 2007. The growth in amortization costs in 2008 primarily reflected the higher level of amortized commission expense in 2008 resulting from the Company's implementation of a new fixed agent compensation program in 2007, as well as an increase in business volume. \n\nIn 2009, general and administrative expenses of $784 million were $45 million lower than the comparable 2008 total of $829 million. The decrease resulted from revised estimates of windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike. During 2008, the Company recorded $77 million of estimated property windpool assessments in the Personal Insurance segment in general and administrative expenses. Subsequently, during the first half of 2009, the Company recorded a $48 million reduction in these estimated assessments due to a decline in estimated insurance industry losses related to Hurricane Ike. Adjusting for the impact of windpool assessments in both 2009 and 2008, general and administrative expenses in 2009 increased 11%, over 2008, primarily reflecting growth in business volume and continued investments to support business growth and product development, including the Company's direct to consumer initiative. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $829 million in 2008, an increase of $130 million, or 19% over the 2007 total of $699 million. The increase in 2008 included the impact of $77 million of estimated hurricane-related assessments. The remaining increase reflected growth in business volume and continued investments to support business growth and product development. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratio \n\nIn 2009, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 65.0% was 1.2 points lower than the comparable 2008 ratio of 66.2%. The cost of catastrophes accounted for 3.9 points of the 2009 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, whereas the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2008 included a 7.8 point impact of the cost of catastrophes. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2009 and 2008 included 1.9 point and 2.1 point benefits, respectively from net favorable prior year reserve development. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratios adjusted for catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development for 2009 was 2.5 points higher than the 2008 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of loss cost trends. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 66.2% in 2008 was 7.6 points higher than the comparable 2007 ratio of 58.6%. The 2008 ratio included a 7.8 point impact of the cost of catastrophes and a 2.1 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development, whereas the 2007 ratio included a 2.4 point impact of the cost of catastrophes and a 2.2 point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development. The 2008 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio adjusted for catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 2.1 points higher than the 2007 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in non-catastrophe weather related losses in the Homeowners and Other line of business and loss cost trends. \n\nIn 2009, the underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% was 1.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.8% in 2008. The 2009 underwriting expense ratio included a 0.7 point benefit from the reduction in the estimate of windpool assessments described above, whereas the 2008 underwriting expense ratio included a 1.1 point increase due to the impact related to the windpool assessments. Adjusting for these factors in both years, the underwriting expense ratio for 2009 was 0.6 points higher than the 2008 underwriting expense ratio, primarily reflecting expenses resulting from the Company's direct to consumer initiative. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 30.8% in 2008 was 2.6 points higher than the 2007 ratio of 28.2%. The 2008 ratio included a 1.1 point impact from estimated hurricane-related assessments, whereas the 2007 ratio included a 1.0 point benefit from the implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program. Adjusting for these factors, the 2008 expense ratio was 0.5 points higher than the adjusted expense ratio for 2007, primarily reflecting continued investments to support business growth and product development. \n\nAgency Written Premiums \n\nPersonal Insurance's gross and net written premiums by product line were as follows for its Agency business, which comprises business written through agents, brokers and other intermediaries, and represents almost all of the Personal Insurance segment's gross and net written premiums: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Agency Automobile &#160; $ 3,610 &#160; $ 3,680 &#160; $ 3,673 &#160; Agency Homeowners and Other &#160; &#160; 3,809 &#160; &#160; 3,599 &#160; &#160; 3,471 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Agency Personal Insurance &#160; $ 7,419 &#160; $ 7,279 &#160; $ 7,144 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Agency Automobile &#160; $ 3,586 &#160; $ 3,651 &#160; $ 3,628 &#160; Agency Homeowners and Other &#160; &#160; 3,508 &#160; &#160; 3,333 &#160; &#160; 3,207 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Agency Personal Insurance &#160; $ 7,094 &#160; $ 6,984 &#160; $ 6,835 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net Agency written premiums in 2009 both increased by 2% over the comparable 2008 totals. In 2008, gross and net Agency written premiums also both increased 2% over the comparable 2007 totals. Mendota accounted for $49 million of both gross and net written premiums in 2007. Adjusting for the sale of Mendota in 2007, gross and net written premiums in 2008 both increased 3% over the 2007 totals. \n\nIn 2009, net written premiums in the Agency Automobile line of business decreased 2% from 2008. The impact of increasing renewal premium changes was more than offset by declines in new business volume and business retention rates compared with 2008. In the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business, net written premiums in 2009 grew 5% over 2008, driven by increases in renewal premium changes. New business volume was consistent with 2008 and business retention rates remained strong and consistent with 2008. \n\nIn the Agency Automobile line of business, net written premiums in 2008 increased 2% over 2007, adjusting for the sale of Mendota. Business retention rates in 2008 remained strong and were consistent with 2007. Renewal price changes in 2008 remained positive and consistent with 2007. New business levels in 2008 increased over 2007. In the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business, net written premiums in 2008 grew 4% over 2007. Business retention rates in 2008 remained strong and were consistent with 2007. Renewal price changes in 2008 remained positive but declined from 2007. New business levels also remained strong and increased slightly over 2007. \n\nFor its Agency business, the Personal Insurance segment had approximately 7.4 million and 7.3 million active policies at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the Agency Automobile line of business, active policies at December 31, 2009 decreased 3% from the same date in 2008. Active policies in the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business at December 31, 2009 grew by 3% over the same date in 2008. \n\nInterest Expense and Other \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Operating loss &#160; $ (233 ) $ (257 ) $ (209 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $24 million decline in operating loss for Interest Expense and Other in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflected a benefit of $28 million in 2009 from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. After-tax interest expense in 2009 totaled $248 million, compared with $239 million in 2008. \n\nThe $48 million increase in operating loss for Interest Expense and Other in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily driven by a $52 million benefit in 2007 resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. The net loss in 2008 included after-tax interest expense of $239 million, compared with $224 million in 2007. The net loss in 2007 also included an after-tax loss of $25 million related to the Company's redemption of its 4.50% contingently convertible debentures in April 2007, consisting of the redemption premium paid and the write-off of remaining debt issuance costs. \n\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders. While the Company has experienced a decrease in new asbestos claims over the past several years, the Company continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the Company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy), including claims against the Company's policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure. Factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. This trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. \n\nThe Company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and other Company defenses are not successful, the Company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Accordingly, although the Company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. \n\nMany coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases \n\nwhich are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. There also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the Company. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. \n\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. The Company anticipates the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. \n\nTravelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into settlement agreements, which are subject to a number of contingencies, in connection with a number of these direct action claims. These settlement agreements had been approved by the court in connection with proceedings initiated by TPC in the Johns Manville bankruptcy court. On March 29, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York substantially affirmed the bankruptcy court's orders, while vacating that portion of the bankruptcy court's orders which required all future direct actions against TPC to first be approved by the bankruptcy court before proceeding in state or federal court. Various parties appealed the district court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On February 15, 2008, the Second Circuit issued an opinion vacating on jurisdictional grounds the district court's approval of the bankruptcy court's order that barred the filing of certain direct action claims against TPC in the future. TPC and certain other parties filed Petitions for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit's decision. Those petitions were granted and on June 18, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Company, reversing the Second Circuit's decision. However, since the Second Circuit had not ruled on several additional issues principally related to procedural matters and the adequacy of notice provided to certain parties, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Second Circuit for further proceedings on those specific issues. Oral argument before the Second Circuit on the remaining issues was held on October 22, 2009 and the parties await a ruling. Accordingly, the settlements are not yet final. (For a description of these matters, see \"Part I&#151;Item 3&#151;Legal Proceedings\"). \n\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a product/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2009, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review. As in prior years, the review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and \"non-product\" liability. The \"home office and field office\" category (as defined below), which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, again experienced an overall reduction in new claim filings. Overall gross defense and indemnity costs in these categories remained at similar levels to what the Company has experienced in recent years due to the continued high level of trial activity involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, rather than decreasing \n\nslightly as the Company had expected. While there was an aggregate decrease in the number of claims received, the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims for the first time increased from the number tendering claims for the first time in 2008. \n\nThe Company also noted the continuation of recent trends, which included: \n\n&#149; stable payment patterns for a large proportion of policyholders; &#149; a decrease in the number of claims received; &#149; a decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the Company due to additional settlement activity; &#149; continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity; and &#149; the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants. While the Company believes that these trends indicate a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims. \n\nThe Company's quarterly asbestos reserve review includes an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. Developing payment patterns among policyholders in the \"home office and field office\" and \"assumed reinsurance and other\" categories are also analyzed. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. For certain policyholders an estimate of the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined, and for those policyholders the Company calculates, by each policy year, a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, past ceded experience and reinsurance collections. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the Company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. The completion of these reviews and analyses in the third quarter resulted in a $185 million increase in the Company's asbestos reserves, which was primarily driven by a slight increase in the Company's assumption for projected defense costs related to a broad range of policyholders. Overall, the company's assessment of the underlying asbestos environment did not change significantly from recent periods. The Company recorded a $70 million increase to asbestos reserves in 2008, which was driven by a change in the estimated costs associated with litigating asbestos coverage matters and a change in estimated losses for certain individual policyholders. The Company recorded no asbestos reserve additions in 2007. \n\nNet asbestos losses paid in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $341 million, $658 million and $317 million, respectively. (Asbestos payments in 2008 included the Company's one-time net payment of $365 million associated with the settlement of the ACandS, Inc. matter). Approximately 41%, 59% and 20% of total net paid losses in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company's liability. \n\nThe Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Number of Policyholders &#160; Total Net Paid &#160; Net Asbestos Reserves &#160; (at and for the year ended December 31, $ in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; Policyholders with settlement agreements &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; 23 &#160; $ 139 &#160; $ 389 &#160; $ 621 &#160; $ 749 &#160; Home office and field office &#160; &#160; 1,697 &#160; &#160; 1,651 &#160; &#160; 176 &#160; &#160; 217 &#160; &#160; 1,956 &#160; &#160; 1,983 &#160; Assumed reinsurance and other &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; 41 &#160; &#160; 181 &#160; &#160; 182 &#160; International &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 1,715 &#160; &#160; 1,674 &#160; $ 341 &#160; $ 658 &#160; $ 2,758 &#160; $ 2,914 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe \"policyholders with settlement agreements\" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts. Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Included in this category are TPC's settlements of the Statutory and Hawaii Actions and the Common Law Claims (collectively the Direct Action Settlement). Unless the bankruptcy court's order approving the settlement is reinstated and becomes final, the Direct Action Settlement will be voided and TPC will have no obligation to pay the amounts under the Direct Action Settlement (other than certain administrative expenses). In that event, the reserves assigned to the settlement will be returned to TPC's unallocated asbestos reserve. (For a description of these matters, see \"Item 3&#151;Legal Proceedings\"). Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with major policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. \n\nThe \"home office and field office\" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. Policyholders are identified for home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential \"non-product\" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. In addition to IBNR amounts contained in the reserves for \"home office and field office\" policyholders and the costs of litigating asbestos coverage matters, the Company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the Company. The \"assumed reinsurance and other\" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. \n\nOn January 29, 2009, the Company and PPG Industries, Inc (\"PPG\"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of PPG, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG. The tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (\"Amended Plan\") proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (\"PCC\", which is 50% owned by PPG) bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the proposed Amended Plan, which was filed on January 30, 2009, PCC, along with enumerated other companies (including PPG as well as the Company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims. Under the agreement in principle, the Company has the option to make a series of payments over the next 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the Trust to be created under the Amended Plan, \n\nor it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of June 30, 2010, would total approximately $443 million (approximately $414 million after reinsurance). The agreement in principle with PPG is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the Amended Plan, and the Company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied. The Company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the unallocated asbestos IBNR reserve. \n\nIn December 2008, the Company completed the sale of Unionamerica, which comprised its United Kingdom-based runoff insurance and reinsurance businesses. Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves transferred to the purchaser were gross and net asbestos reserves of $330 million and $232 million, respectively. \n\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; $ 3,299 &#160; $ 4,353 &#160; $ 4,777 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (385 ) &#160; (619 ) &#160; (726 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 2,914 &#160; &#160; 3,734 &#160; &#160; 4,051 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 185 &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; (1 ) &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 185 &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Losses paid: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 387 &#160; &#160; 794 &#160; &#160; 423 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (46 ) &#160; (136 ) &#160; (106 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 341 &#160; &#160; 658 &#160; &#160; 317 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sale of subsidiary: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 330 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; (98 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 232 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 3,097 &#160; &#160; 3,299 &#160; &#160; 4,353 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (339 ) &#160; (385 ) &#160; (619 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; $ 2,758 &#160; $ 2,914 &#160; $ 3,734 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSee \"&#151;Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\" \n\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several with other responsible parties. \n\nThe Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount. \n\nThe resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis as opposed to a claim-by-claim basis. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a \"buy-back\" of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the Company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. These agreements also include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs. \n\nIn establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the allegations of environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves. \n\nIn its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements. \n\nThe duration of the Company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years. \n\nThe Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time. These policyholders generally present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. In recent years, the Company had experienced a decline in both the number of new policyholders tendering claims for the first time and the number of pending lawsuits between the Company and its policyholders pertaining to coverage for environmental claims. However, during 2009 the Company experienced an increase in the number of policyholders tendering claims for the first time and in the number of pending environmental-related coverage actions. In addition, the Company experienced upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders. As a result, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $70 million in the second quarter of 2009. In 2008, the Company increased its environmental reserves by $85 million as a result of upward development in the anticipated defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders. In 2007, the Company increased its environmental reserves by $185 million primarily in response to the moderation in the rate of decline in both the number of new policyholders tendering claims for the first time and the number of pending lawsuits between the Company and its policyholders pertaining to coverage for environmental claims. \n\nIn December 2008, the Company completed the sale of Unionamerica, which comprised its United Kingdom-based runoff insurance and reinsurance businesses. Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves transferred to the purchaser were gross and net environmental reserves of $40 million and $33 million, respectively. \n\nNet paid losses in 2009 and 2008 were $91 million and $128 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, approximately 93% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $365 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 7% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $28 million), consists of case reserves. \n\nThe following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; $ 400 &#160; $ 478 &#160; $ 413 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 414 &#160; &#160; 490 &#160; &#160; 418 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; &#160; 182 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (15 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; &#160; 185 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Losses paid: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 96 &#160; &#160; 123 &#160; &#160; 117 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; (4 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 91 &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; 113 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sale of subsidiary: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 40 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; (7 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 389 &#160; &#160; 400 &#160; &#160; 478 &#160; &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; $ 393 &#160; $ 414 &#160; $ 490 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES \n\nAs a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2009 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This development will be affected by future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is \n\nparticularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. (Also, see \"Part I&#151;Item 3, Legal Proceedings\"). \n\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods. \n\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO \n\nThe Company's invested assets at December 31, 2009 totaled $74.97 billion, of which 94% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate and 4% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a conservative investment philosophy. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal bonds, and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \n\nThe Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009 totaled $65.85 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was \"Aa2\" at December 31, 2009 and \"Aa1\" at December 31, 2008. The slight decline in the Company's average credit quality rating was due to the downgrading of a monoline bond insurer during the second quarter of 2009 and the downgrading of non-agency mortgage-backed securities. Below investment grade securities represented 2.7% and 2.0% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The downgrading of non-agency mortgage backed securities and an increase in the fair value of those and other below investment grade securities also resulted in an increase to our below investment grade securities. The average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.9 (4.2 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2009 and 4.2 (4.6 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2008. The decline in duration resulted from the impact of declining market yields on existing holdings of municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities (which impact the assumptions related to optional pre-payments and the related estimate of effective duration for callable securities), and the purchase of shorter-term fixed maturities during the second half of 2009. \n\nThe following table sets forth the Company's combined fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2009, in millions) \n\n&#160; Carrying Value &#160; Percent of Total Carrying Value &#160; Quality Rating: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; $ 28,093 &#160; &#160; 42.7 % &#160; Aa &#160; &#160; 24,861 &#160; &#160; 37.8 &#160; &#160; A &#160; &#160; 7,000 &#160; &#160; 10.6 &#160; &#160; Baa &#160; &#160; 4,091 &#160; &#160; 6.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total investment grade &#160; &#160; 64,045 &#160; &#160; 97.3 &#160; &#160; Below investment grade &#160; &#160; 1,802 &#160; &#160; 2.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total fixed maturity investments &#160; $ 65,847 &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncluded in the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009 were $1.96 billion of debt securities issued by foreign governments and $14.78 billion of corporate fixed maturities and redeemable preferred stock. These credit exposures are diversified across a number of countries and industries.

(2) Sovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the Temporary Liquidity Guaranty and the Federal Ship Financing Programs. (3) Included in commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans are $200 million of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government and $36 million by government sponsored enterprises. \n\nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 included $41.33 billion of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts, and similar issuers. On April 2, 2009, municipal securities issued by local governments within the United States were assigned a negative outlook by Moody's Investors Service. Included in the municipal bond portfolio are $6.06 billion of advance refunded or escrowed-to-maturity bonds. Advance refunded and escrowed-to-maturity bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest. Such escrow accounts are verified as to their sufficiency by an external auditor and almost exclusively involve U.S. Treasury securities. The following table shows the geographic distribution of the remaining $35.27 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2009 which were not advance refunded or escrowed-to-maturity. \n\n##TABLE_START State (in millions) \n\n&#160; State General Obligation &#160; Local General Obligation &#160; Revenue &#160; Total Fair Value &#160; Average Quality Rating(1) Texas &#160; $ 438 &#160; $ 2,204 &#160; $ 1,422 &#160; $ 4,064 &#160; Aa1 California &#160; &#160; 115 &#160; &#160; 1,668 &#160; &#160; 436 &#160; &#160; 2,219 &#160; Aa2 Illinois &#160; &#160; 350 &#160; &#160; 1,020 &#160; &#160; 672 &#160; &#160; 2,042 &#160; Aa2 Virginia &#160; &#160; 201 &#160; &#160; 693 &#160; &#160; 735 &#160; &#160; 1,629 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Washington &#160; &#160; 446 &#160; &#160; 756 &#160; &#160; 421 &#160; &#160; 1,623 &#160; Aa1 Florida &#160; &#160; 530 &#160; &#160; 81 &#160; &#160; 920 &#160; &#160; 1,531 &#160; Aa1 Minnesota &#160; &#160; 450 &#160; &#160; 663 &#160; &#160; 206 &#160; &#160; 1,319 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 New York &#160; &#160; 49 &#160; &#160; 235 &#160; &#160; 973 &#160; &#160; 1,257 &#160; Aa1 Maryland &#160; &#160; 376 &#160; &#160; 609 &#160; &#160; 263 &#160; &#160; 1,248 &#160; Aaa/Aa1 Arizona &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 524 &#160; &#160; 708 &#160; &#160; 1,232 &#160; Aa1 Georgia &#160; &#160; 444 &#160; &#160; 427 &#160; &#160; 331 &#160; &#160; 1,202 &#160; Aa1 North Carolina &#160; &#160; 454 &#160; &#160; 615 &#160; &#160; 128 &#160; &#160; 1,197 &#160; Aaa Ohio &#160; &#160; 392 &#160; &#160; 357 &#160; &#160; 374 &#160; &#160; 1,123 &#160; Aa1 All Others(2) &#160; &#160; 3,490 &#160; &#160; 4,245 &#160; &#160; 5,850 &#160; &#160; 13,585 &#160; Aa1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 7,735 &#160; $ 14,097 &#160; $ 13,439 &#160; $ 35,271 &#160; Aa1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default. (2) No other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of the total non-advance-refunded or escrowed-to-maturity municipal bonds. \n\nThe Company bases its investment decision on the credit characteristics of the municipal security; however, its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default. The downgrade during 2009 and 2008 of credit ratings of insurers of these securities resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities to the underlying rating of the respective security. Of the insured municipal securities in the Company's investment portfolio at December 31, 2009, approximately 98% were rated at A3 or above, and approximately 80% were rated at Aa3 or above, without the benefit of insurance. The Company believes that a further loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the Company's ability and intent to hold the securities. The average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was \"Aa3\" at December 31, 2009. The average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was \"Aa1\" at December 31, 2009 with and without the third-party insurance. \n\nAt December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS, including FHA project loans) of $714 million and $766 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, approximately $236 million of these securities, or the loans backing such securities, contained guarantees by the U.S. government or a government-sponsored enterprise and $20 million were comprised of Canadian non-guaranteed securities. The average credit rating of the $478 million of non-guaranteed securities at December 31, 2009 was \"Aaa,\" and 91% of those securities were issued in 2004 and prior years. The CMBS portfolio is supported by loans that are diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas. The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities. \n\nThe Company makes investments in residential collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) that typically have high credit quality, offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to U.S. Treasury securities. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved. One significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity. While prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration) and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company does invest in other types of CMO tranches if a careful assessment indicates a favorable risk/return tradeoff. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. \n\nAt December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $2.58 billion and $2.84 billion, respectively (in addition to the CMBS securities of $714 million and $766 million, respectively, described above). Approximately 37% and 35% of the Company's CMO holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held $2.63 billion and $3.22 billion, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans which are included with CMBS) mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. The average credit rating of all of the above securities was \"Aa1\" at December 31, 2009, and \"Aaa\" at December 31, 2008. \n\nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 included asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages with a collective fair value of $270 million and $206 million, respectively (comprising approximately 0.4% and 0.3% of the Company's total fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). The disruption in secondary investment markets for mortgage-backed securities provided the Company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages at discounted prices. The Company purchased $74 million and $47 million of such securities in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. Alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entity's requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entity's guidelines for documentation, property type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. The average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the Company was \"A3\" and \"Aa2\" at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately $114 million of the Company's asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime and alternative documentation mortgages were downgraded in 2009. An additional $39 million of such securities were placed on credit watch during 2009. Approximately $81 million of the Company's asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime and alternative documentation mortgages were downgraded in 2008. \n\nThe Company's real estate investments include warehouses and office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned. The Company's other investments are primarily comprised of private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities, which are subject to more volatility than the Company's fixed maturity investments. While these asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities, in 2009 and 2008 the returns were significantly lower than in prior periods and, in the aggregate, produced negative investment income, reflecting market conditions. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $2.95 billion and $3.04 billion, respectively. \n\nThe Company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income from the lending of certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. \n\nBorrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. This collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and the Company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the Company's securities is in default under the lending agreement. Therefore, the Company does not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. The loaned securities remain a recorded asset of the Company. The Company accepts only cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $90 million and $8 million, respectively, of securities on loan to others. The Company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. \n\nThe net unrealized investment gains (losses) that were included as a separate component of accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; $ 2,536 &#160; $ (294 ) $ 768 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 78 &#160; &#160; (82 ) &#160; 15 &#160; Other investments &#160; &#160; 216 &#160; &#160; 123 &#160; &#160; 155 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unrealized investment gains (losses) before tax &#160; &#160; 2,830 &#160; &#160; (253 ) &#160; 938 &#160; Tax expense (benefit) &#160; &#160; 969 &#160; &#160; (109 ) &#160; 318 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net unrealized investment gains (losses) at end of year &#160; $ 1,861 &#160; $ (144 ) $ 620 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet pretax unrealized investment gains totaled $2.83 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with net pretax unrealized investment losses of $253 million at December 31, 2008. The improvement in the Company's net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2009 over the prior year is primarily attributable to the Company's fixed maturity investments. The improved valuations on these holdings reflect the changing market conditions in 2009 which included a significant narrowing of credit spreads. \n\nNet pretax unrealized investment losses totaled $253 million at December 31, 2008, compared with net pretax unrealized investment gains of $938 million at December 31, 2007. The net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2008 reflected the impact of rising interest rates on longer-dated fixed maturity securities (primarily due to the widening of credit spreads generally), as well as net unrealized investment losses on equity securities, which reflected current market conditions. \n\nImpairment charges included in net realized investment gains (losses) were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; 2007 &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. Government and government agencies and authorities &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; Debt securities issued by foreign governments &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities &#160; &#160; 81 &#160; &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; All other corporate bonds &#160; &#160; 88 &#160; &#160; 283 &#160; &#160; 37 &#160; &#160; Redeemable preferred stock &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total fixed maturities &#160; &#160; 169 &#160; &#160; 324 &#160; &#160; 37 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Common stock &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 34 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; Non-redeemable preferred stock &#160; &#160; 64 &#160; &#160; 40 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total equity securities &#160; &#160; 79 &#160; &#160; 74 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other investments &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 258 &#160; $ 420 &#160; $ 70 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized the following other-than-temporary impairments: \n\n&#149; $169 million in the fixed maturities portfolio, consisting of $81 million related to structured mortgage securities, $70 million related to the deteriorated financial position of various issuers and $18 million related to securities the Company either had the intent to sell or did not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in market value; &#149; $79 million in the equity portfolio related to securities with respect to which it was determined that the cost basis of those securities would not be recovered over the expected holding period. The majority of these impairments were related to issuers in the financial industry; and &#149; $10 million in other investments related to the decline in the financial condition of various issuers. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized the following other-than-temporary impairments: \n\n&#149; $324 million in the fixed maturities portfolio, consisting of $210 million related to the deteriorated financial position of various issuers (of which $70 million related to securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries), $81 million related to externally managed securities with respect to which the Company does not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in market value and $33 million resulting from the intent or potential to sell various holdings prior to a recovery in market value; &#149; $74 million in the equity portfolio consisting of $26 million related to externally managed securities with respect to which the Company does not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value, $26 million related to securities with respect to which it was determined that the cost basis of those securities would not be recovered over the expected holding period and $22 million resulting from the intent or potential to sell prior to a recovery in fair value; 109 \n\n&#149; $14 million in the venture capital portfolio on 16 holdings, consisting of $6 million related to six holdings which were externally managed securities with respect to which the Company does not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value and ten holdings which experienced fundamental economic deterioration; and &#149; $8 million in other investments of which $6 million related to the decline in the financial condition of a privately-held investment and $2 million resulted from the intent or potential to sell prior to a recovery in fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized the following other-than-temporary impairments: \n\n&#149; $37 million in the fixed maturities portfolio, consisting of $23 million related to externally managed securities with respect to which the Company does not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value, and $14 million related to credit risk associated with various issuers' deteriorated financial position; &#149; $7 million in the equity portfolio related to externally managed securities with respect to which the Company does not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value; &#149; $10 million in the real estate portfolio, related to the decline in the financial condition of one real estate development property; and &#149; $16 million in the venture capital portfolio on 14 holdings. Three of the holdings were public securities whose cost basis was not anticipated to be recovered over the expected holding period. Nine holdings experienced economic deterioration (characterized by less than expected revenues or a change in product). The remaining two holdings were impaired due to the impending sale, liquidation or shutdown of the entity. The Company had a net pretax unrealized gain of $2.54 billion in its fixed maturities portfolio at December 31, 2009, compared with a net pretax unrealized loss of $294 million at December 31, 2008. In 2009, yields on municipal fixed maturity securities declined, which increased the market value of the Company's portfolio of such securities. In addition, credit spreads narrowed on other non-municipal fixed maturity securities which also resulted in an increase in the market value of those securities. \n\nThe following table summarizes, for all fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale and for equity securities reported at fair value for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost at December 31, 2009, the gross unrealized investment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position of greater than 20% of amortized cost: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Period For Which Fair Value Is Less Than 80% of Amortized Cost &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Less Than 3 Months &#160; Greater Than 3 Months, Less Than 6 Months &#160; Greater Than 6 Months, Less Than 12 Months &#160; Greater Than 12 Months &#160; Total &#160; Fixed maturities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 55 &#160; $ 94 &#160; &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; 45 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total fixed maturities &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; &#160; 87 &#160; &#160; 139 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 33 &#160; $ 87 &#160; $ 150 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThese unrealized investment losses at December 31, 2009 represent less than 1% of the combined fixed maturity and equity security portfolios on a pretax basis and less than 1% of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis. \n\nFor fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity. \n\nAt December 31, 2009, below investment grade securities comprised 2.7% of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2009 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $1.06 billion and a fair value of $927 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized investment loss of $136 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 2% of both the total amortized cost and the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009. These securities accounted for 42% of the total pretax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2009. \n\nFollowing are the pretax realized losses on investments sold during the year ended December 31, 2009: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Loss &#160; Fair Value &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 866 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 892 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations. \n\nCATASTROPHE MODELING \n\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including computer modeling techniques, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. The Company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. \n\nIn making underwriting and reinsurance decisions for hurricane and earthquake exposures, the company uses third-party proprietary computer modeling in an attempt to estimate the likelihood that the loss from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed a particular amount. The tables below set forth the estimated probabilities that losses from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the Company's common equity). For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. hurricane occurring in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.1 billion, or 4 percent of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2009. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Dollars (in billions) &#160; Likelihood of Exceedance(1) \n\n&#160; Single Hurricane &#160; Single Earthquake &#160; 2.0% (1-in-50) &#160; $ 0.9 &#160; $ 0.4 &#160; 1.0% (1-in-100) &#160; $ 1.1 &#160; $ 0.6 &#160; 0.4% (1-in-250) &#160; $ 2.1 &#160; $ 0.9 &#160; 0.1% (1-in-1,000) &#160; $ 4.5 &#160; $ 2.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Percentage of Common Equity(2) &#160; Likelihood of Exceedance \n\n&#160; Single Hurricane &#160; Single Earthquake &#160; 2.0% (1-in-50) &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; 2 % 1.0% (1-in-100) &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; 2 % 0.4% (1-in-250) &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; 4 % 0.1% (1-in-1,000) &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; 9 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a \"1-in-50 year event.\" As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. (2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gain (loss) on investments, net of taxes. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis provides a useful metric for investors to understand the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position. \n\nThe threshold loss amounts in the tables above are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude loss adjustment expense, which historically has been less than 10% of loss estimates. The above threshold loss amounts reflect the most recent version of the modeling software. The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. exposures and include property exposures (other than offshore energy and marine exposures), property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts. This information in the tables is based on the Company's in-force portfolio and catastrophic reinsurance program as of December 31, 2009. \n\nCatastrophe modeling requires a significant amount of judgment and a number of assumptions and relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. As a result, such models may fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or that are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. \n\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, for example, floods, tornadoes and acts of terrorism. \n\nThere are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable. \n\nFor more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\" \n\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS \n\nSevere weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophe and other weather-related events. Some scientists believe that, in recent years, changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters. Accordingly, if climate conditions change in the future, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable. \n\nThe Company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this report and under \"&#151;Outlook\" herein. For example, among other things: \n\n&#149; Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\" and \"&#151;Outlook&#151;Underwriting Profitability.\" &#149; Such changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of municipal and corporate securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of municipal bond issuers in the Southwestern U.S. and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the Southeastern U.S., among other areas. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material losses.\" &#149; Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers. For example, state insurance regulation could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. If the Company is unable to implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\" &#149; The full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. Through the Company's Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups as appropriate to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. See \"Risk Factors&#151;The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\" Climate change regulation also could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses. \n\nThe Company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. \n\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES \n\nCeded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools, and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to the Company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the Company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. The Company also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. The Company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and the price of their product offerings. After reinsurance is purchased, the Company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. In addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the European Union and the United Kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority. \n\nThe Company's reinsurance recoverables totaled $12.82 billion at December 31, 2009, a decline of $1.42 billion from year-end 2008, primarily reflecting various commutation agreements and collections on reinsurance recoverables, including those related to prior years' hurricane losses. \n\nThe Company has also entered into Master Security Agreements with certain reinsurers. These agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral. The specific conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided by these agreements vary based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the reinsurers' legal structure and trading history with the Company. \n\nThe following table presents the Company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2009 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of each reinsurer group at February 18, 2010: \n\n##TABLE_START Reinsurer Group \n\n&#160; Reinsurance Recoverable &#160; A.M.

Structured settlements comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company's top \n\nfive groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2009 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant insurer from each insurer group at February 18, 2010: \n\n##TABLE_START Group \n\n&#160; Structured Settlements &#160; A.M.

A number of such companies have been subjected to downgrades and/or negative outlook changes by various ratings agencies, including those with which the Company conducts business. The Company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts. \n\nOUTLOOK \n\nThe following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position. \n\nPremiums. The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business, including the impact of audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations, and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure. Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions and general economic conditions. \n\nThe Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain high, generally consistent with recent periods, in each of its business segments. In the Business Insurance and the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segments, the Company expects renewal premium changes in 2010 will be similar to 2009 levels or modestly higher. With regard to the components comprising renewal premium changes, the Company expects that positive rate changes during 2010 will be largely offset by a decline in insured exposures. In the Personal Insurance segment, the Company expects that Agency Automobile renewal premium changes, while positive, will decrease slightly in 2010 from 2009 levels. For its Agency Homeowners' and Other business, the Company expects renewal premium changes in 2010 will remain generally consistent with 2009 levels. \n\nThe pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. While property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive in 2010 for new business, the Company believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities as agents, brokers and customers seek to place business with high-quality carriers. In addition, the Company announced in 2009 that it launched a new distribution channel that markets personal insurance products directly to consumers, which is expected to generate modest growth in premium volume for Personal Insurance in 2010. \n\nWhile economic conditions have recently improved and U.S. gross domestic product experienced growth in the latter part of 2009, that trend may not continue and the U.S. economy may enter into a \"double dip\" recession. Further, if growth continues, it may be at a slow rate for an extended period of time. In addition, other economic conditions, such as the commercial and residential real estate \n\nenvironment and employment rates, may continue to be weak. If weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate, low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and our ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, such low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could adversely impact net written premiums in 2010. Since earned premiums lag net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted in 2010 and into 2011. \n\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The anticipated impact of competitive market conditions and general economic conditions on the Company's earned premiums, as discussed above, coupled with an expected modest increase in loss costs, will likely result in modestly reduced underwriting profitability during 2010, as compared with 2009. In addition, the Company's direct to consumer initiative in the Personal Insurance segment, discussed above, while intended to enhance the Company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures. \n\nIn recent periods, the Company has experienced net favorable prior year reserve development, driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the Company's segments for prior loss years. If better than expected loss experience continues, the Company may recognize additional net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010. However, better than expected loss experience may not continue or may reverse, in which case the Company may recognize no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods. The ongoing review of prior year claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods. \n\nCatastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable from year to year, and the Company's results of operations would be adversely impacted by a significant increase in such losses in 2010. \n\nInvestments. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively low average effective duration. The Company's invested assets at December 31, 2009 totaled $74.97 billion, of which 94% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term securities, with the remaining 6% invested in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships. \n\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. While investment returns are difficult to predict and inherently uncertain, in 2010 the Company expects investment returns for its fixed maturity investment portfolio to be generally consistent with recent periods, and returns for its short-term and non-fixed maturity investment portfolios to remain challenged. Short-term interest rates are expected to remain at or near historically low levels. The Company expects investment income in its non-fixed maturity investment portfolio to improve from 2009 levels, which were negative. However, if general economic conditions and/or capital market conditions deteriorate in 2010, the Company could also experience a reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments. \n\nCapital Position. The Company believes it has a strong capital position and expects to continue its common share repurchase program in 2010 as part of its continuing efforts to maximize shareholder value. During 2010, the Company expects to repurchase between $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion of its common shares under its share repurchase authorization. The actual amount of share repurchases may be materially less and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's earnings, corporate and regulatory requirements, share price, catastrophe losses, strategic initiatives and other market conditions. \n\nThe Company had a net after-tax unrealized investment gain of $1.67 billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2009. While the Company does not attempt to predict future \n\ninterest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. \n\nMany of the statements in this \"Outlook\" section are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company's control. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. See \"&#151;Forward Looking Statements.\" For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors\" and \"Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Critical Accounting Estimates\" in this report. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. The liquidity requirements of the Company's business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable. Such claims increase liquidity requirements. The timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the Company's future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources. \n\nAt December 31, 2009, total cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable securities aggregating $2.14 billion were held at the holding company. The assets held at the holding company are sufficient to meet the holding company's current liquidity requirements and are almost twice the Company's target level. These liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends and debt service. The Company intends to reduce the amount of holding company liquidity in 2010, subject to profitability, market conditions and other factors. The Company has a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. The Company also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with several financial institutions that expires in the second quarter of 2010. This line of credit also backs up the Company's $800 million commercial paper program, of which $100 million was outstanding at December 31, 2009. The Company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. The Company may decide to replace the existing credit agreement with a new credit agreement of a different amount or duration, or it could decide to replace the credit facility with other alternatives. \n\nThe Company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $474 million to provide much of the capital needed to support its operations at Lloyd's. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its operations at Lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand. \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $4.23 billion, $3.14 billion and $5.29 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash flows in 2009 reflected a decline in catastrophe loss payments, a higher level of reinsurance recoveries, a reduction in the amount of contributions to the Company's pension plan and lower claims and claim adjustment expense payments related to operations in runoff. Those runoff payments in 2008 included the Company's one-time net payment of $365 million associated with the final settlement of asbestos claims related to ACandS, Inc. During 2009 and 2008, the Company contributed $260 million and $450 million, respectively, to its pension plan. \n\nCash flows in 2008 reflected an increase in claim payments (including the impact of higher catastrophe losses and the $365 million net asbestos settlement payment related to ACandS, Inc.) and a reduction in reinsurance recoveries compared with 2007. In addition, the Company made a $450 million contribution to its pension plan in 2008. No pension plan contribution was made in 2007. Cash flows in 2007 reflected higher levels of collected premiums and net investment income, lower claim payments on catastrophe losses, as well as lower runoff claim payments. Cash flows from operations in 2007 benefited from significant collections on reinsurance recoverables in both years, including those related to 2005 hurricane losses, operations in runoff (primarily Gulf) and various commutation agreements. These factors were partially offset by an increase in tax payments in 2007 resulting from higher profitability, expenses related to increased business volume and continued expenditures to support business growth and product development, and higher interest payments. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flows used in investing activities totaled $899 million, $162 million and $2.53 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Fixed maturity securities accounted for the majority of investment purchases in all three years. Net cash available for use in investing activities in 2009 was principally provided by $4.23 billion of cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by $3.44 billion of cash used in financing activities (principally $3.29 billion for common share repurchases). In 2008, substantially all of the $3.14 billion in cash provided by operating activities was deployed for financing activities, principally for $2.20 billion of common share repurchases. \n\nThe Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2009 increased by $4.23 billion from year-end 2008, primarily reflecting a $3.08 billion pretax increase in the unrealized appreciation of investments since year-end 2008 and investment purchases resulting from strong cash flows from operations, partially offset by $3.29 billion of common share repurchases made during 2009. The improvement in the Company's net unrealized investment gain position at December 31, 2009 over the prior year is primarily attributable to the Company's fixed maturity investments. The improved valuations on these holdings reflect the changing market conditions in 2009 which included a significant narrowing of credit spreads. \n\nThe Company's management of the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio generally produces a duration that exceeds the estimated duration of the Company's net insurance liabilities. The average duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.9 (4.2 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2009 and 4.2 (4.6 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2008. The decline in duration resulted from the impact of declining market yields on existing holdings of municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities (which impact the assumptions related to optional pre-payments and the related estimate of effective duration for callable securities), and the purchase of shorter-term fixed maturities during the second half of 2009. \n\nThe primary goals of the Company's asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities, manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, provide assurance of the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flows used in financing activities totaled $3.44 billion, $2.87 billion and $2.95 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 and 2008 totals primarily reflected common share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and the repayment of debt, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the issuance of debt. The 2007 total primarily reflected common share repurchases, the early redemption of debt, the repayment of maturing debt and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by the issuance of debt and proceeds from employee stock option exercises. \n\nDebt Transactions . \n\n2009. On June 2, 2009, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% senior notes that will mature on June 2, 2019. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately $494 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 2 and December 2 of each year. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined) plus 35 basis points for the senior notes. \n\nOn March 3, 2009, the Company's zero coupon convertible notes with an effective yield of 4.17% and a remaining principal balance of $141 million matured and were fully paid. \n\n2008. On March 15, 2008, the Company's $400 million, 3.75% senior notes matured and were fully paid. On May 13, 2008, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.80% senior notes that will mature on May 15, 2018. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately $496 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate plus 30 basis points for the senior notes. \n\nOn December 15, 2008, two medium-term notes with a cumulative par value of $149 million, each bearing an interest rate of 6.38%, matured and were fully paid. \n\n2007. In January 2007, the Company redeemed $81 million of 8.47% subordinated debentures originally issued in 1997 and due January 10, 2027. The debentures were redeemable by the Company on or after January 10, 2007. In January 1997, USF&#38;G Capital II, a business trust, issued $100 million of capital securities, the proceeds of which, along with $3 million in capital provided by the Company, were used to purchase the subordinated debentures issued by USF&#38;G Corporation and subsequently assumed by the Company after the merger of The St. Paul Companies Inc. (SPC) and Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC). During the period prior to redemption, the Company had repurchased and retired $22 million of the debentures in open market transactions. Upon the Company's redemption of the remaining $81 million of subordinated debentures in January 2007, USF&#38;G Capital II in turn used the proceeds to redeem its remaining capital securities outstanding. USF&#38;G Capital II was then liquidated, and the Company received a $3 million distribution of capital. The Company \n\nrecorded a $3 million pretax gain on the redemption of the subordinated debentures, due to the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment recorded at the merger date, less the redemption premium paid. \n\nIn March 2007, the Company issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 for net proceeds of $986 million (after original issue discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses). The debentures were issued at a discount, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.447%. The debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25% from the date of issuance to, but excluding, March 15, 2017, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15. From and including March 15, 2017, the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 2.215%, payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The Company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the debentures. The Company will not be required to settle deferred interest until it has deferred interest for five consecutive years or, if earlier, made a payment of current interest during a deferral period. The Company may defer interest for up to ten consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will accumulate additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the debentures. \n\nThe debentures carry a 60-year final maturity and a scheduled maturity date in year thirty. During the 180-day period ending not more than fifteen and not less than ten business days prior to the scheduled maturity date, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell enough qualifying capital securities, or at its option, common stock, qualifying warrants, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, debt exchangeable for common equity or debt exchangeable for preferred equity to permit repayment of the debentures at the scheduled maturity date. If any debentures remain outstanding after the scheduled maturity date, the unpaid amount will remain outstanding until the Company has raised sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying capital securities or, at its option, common stock, qualifying warrants, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, debt exchangeable for common equity or debt exchangeable for preferred equity to permit the repayment in full of the debentures. If there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date, the Company is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds. Qualifying capital securities are securities (other than common stock, qualifying warrants, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, debt exchangeable for common equity, and debt exchangeable for preferred equity) which generally are treated by the ratings agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures. \n\nThe Company can redeem the debentures at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after March 15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest. The Company can redeem the debentures at its option prior to March 15, 2017 (a) in whole at any time or in part from time to time or (b) in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain tax or rating agency events relating to the debentures, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount, in each case plus any accrued and unpaid interest. \n\nIn connection with the offering of the debentures, the Company entered into a \"replacement capital covenant\" for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness (which will initially be the 6.750% senior notes due 2036). Under the terms of the replacement capital covenant, if the Company redeems the debentures at any time prior to March 15, 2047 it can only do so with the proceeds of securities that are treated by the rating agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures. \n\nIn March 2007, the Company's $500 million, 5.75% senior notes matured and were fully paid. \n\nIn April 2007, the Company completed the redemption of its outstanding $893 million, 4.50% convertible junior subordinated notes due in 2032 (the notes). The notes were originally issued by \n\nTravelers Property Casualty Corp., and the Company assumed certain obligations relating to the notes pursuant to a Second Supplemental Indenture dated April 1, 2004. Each note had a principal amount of $25.00. The redemption price for each note was $25.5625 plus $0.009375 of accrued and unpaid interest. Any note called for redemption could be surrendered for conversion into common stock before the close of business on April 17, 2007. Each note was convertible into 0.4684 shares of common stock of The Travelers Companies, Inc. Holders of $36 million of the notes tendered their certificates in exchange for the issuance of 670,910 of the Company's common shares. The remaining $857 million of notes were redeemed for cash, along with accrued interest to the date of redemption. The Company recorded a $39 million pretax loss ($25 million after-tax) in other revenues in the second quarter of 2007 related to the redemption, consisting of the redemption premium paid and the write-off of remaining unamortized issuance costs. \n\nIn May 2007, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due June 15, 2012 (the 2012 senior notes), $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due December 15, 2017 (the 2017 senior notes), and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 (the 2037 senior notes). The total net proceeds of these three senior note issuances, after original issuance discounts and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, were approximately $1.47 billion. Interest on each of the senior note issuances is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. Each series of senior notes is redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed, or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate plus 12.5 basis points for the 2012 senior notes, 15 basis points for the 2017 senior notes and 20 basis points for the 2037 senior notes. The Company applied a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay approximately $442 million of senior notes maturing on August 16, 2007 and to repay approximately $42 million of medium-term notes maturing in the third quarter of 2007. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Prior to applying these proceeds, the Company invested them in investment grade, marketable securities. \n\nIn August 2007, the Company's $442 million, 5.01% senior notes matured and were fully paid. \n\nIn 2007, medium-term notes with a cumulative par value of $72 million and interest rates ranging from 6.85% to 7.37% matured and were fully paid. \n\nThe amounts of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that becomes due in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are $273 million, $11 million and $250 million, respectively. \n\nDividends. Dividends paid to shareholders totaled $693 million, $715 million and $742 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On February 3, 2010, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, payable March 31, 2010 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2010. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be at the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. Dividends would be paid by the Company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. \n\nShare Repurchases. Since May 2006, the Company's board of directors has approved four common share repurchase authorizations, for a cumulative authorization of up to $16 billion of shares of the Company's common stock. Under these authorizations, the most recent of which totaled $6 billion and was approved by the board of directors in October 2009, repurchases may be made from time to time \n\nin the open market, pursuant to preset trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's earnings, corporate and regulatory requirements, share price, catastrophe losses, strategic initiatives and other market conditions. The following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2009 under these authorizations and remaining repurchase capacity at December 31, 2009. \n\n##TABLE_START Quarterly Period Ending \n\n&#160; Number of shares purchased &#160; Cost of shares repurchased &#160; Average price paid per share &#160; Remaining capacity under share repurchase authorization &#160; March 31, 2009 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ 3,809,857,539 &#160; June 30, 2009 &#160; &#160; 18,450,066 &#160; &#160; 750,030,914 &#160; &#160; 40.65 &#160; &#160; 3,059,826,625 &#160; September 30, 2009 &#160; &#160; 20,826,981 &#160; &#160; 1,000,035,439 &#160; &#160; 48.02 &#160; &#160; 2,059,791,186 &#160; December 31, 2009 &#160; &#160; 30,095,982 &#160; &#160; 1,550,088,479 &#160; &#160; 51.50 &#160; &#160; 6,509,702,707 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 69,373,029 &#160; $ 3,300,154,832 &#160; $ 47.57 &#160; $ 6,509,702,707 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSince the inception of the repurchase authorizations in May 2006, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 193.2 million shares for a total cost of $9.49 billion, or $49.12 per share, through December 31, 2009. \n\nIn 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company acquired 1.5 million, 0.8 million and 1.7 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nCapital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company's capital structure at December 31, 2009 and 2008. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; Debt: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; $ 373 &#160; $ 242 &#160; &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; 6,165 &#160; &#160; 5,938 &#160; &#160; Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs &#160; &#160; (11 ) &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total debt &#160; &#160; 6,527 &#160; &#160; 6,181 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Preferred shareholders' equity &#160; &#160; 79 &#160; &#160; 89 &#160; Common shareholders' equity: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock &#160; &#160; 26,117 &#160; &#160; 26,130 &#160; &#160; Accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources &#160; &#160; 1,219 &#160; &#160; (900 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total shareholders' equity &#160; &#160; 27,415 &#160; &#160; 25,319 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total capitalization &#160; $ 33,942 &#160; $ 31,500 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $2.44 billion increase in total capitalization from year-end 2008 reflected an increase in unrealized appreciation on investment securities, net income in 2009 and the issuance of debt, partially offset by common share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and debt maturities. The improvement in the Company's net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2009 over the prior year is primarily attributable to the Company's fixed maturity investments. The improved valuations on these holdings reflect the changing market conditions in 2009 which included a significant narrowing of credit spreads. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; Total capitalization excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments &#160; $ 32,081 &#160; $ 31,644 &#160; Net unrealized gain (loss) on investments, net of taxes &#160; &#160; 1,861 &#160; &#160; (144 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total capitalization &#160; $ 33,942 &#160; $ 31,500 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Debt-to-total capital ratio &#160; &#160; 19.2 % &#160; 19.6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments &#160; &#160; 20.3 % &#160; 19.5 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized investment gain (loss) on investments, net of taxes. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company's financial leverage position. The Company's debt-to-total capital ratio of 20.3% at December 31, 2009 calculated on this basis approximated its targeted level. \n\nLine of Credit Agreement. The Company has a $1.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the \"credit agreement\") with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 10, 2010. Pursuant to covenants in the credit agreement, the Company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than $10 billion at all times. The Company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. In addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and all other covenants related to its outstanding debt instruments. There was no amount outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2009. The Company is evaluating its options with regard to the forthcoming expiration of the credit agreement. The credit agreement provides back-up liquidity for the Company's $800 million commercial paper program, of which $100 million was outstanding at December 31, 2009. \n\nIn December 2008, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities to replace its expiring universal shelf registration statement. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering. During 2009, the Company issued securities with a principal amount of $500 million under the new shelf registration statement, and in 2008, the Company issued securities with a principal amount of $500 million under the prior shelf registration statement. \n\nShare Repurchase Authorization. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $6.51 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2009, the Company's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claims related payments. The table excludes short-term obligations and includes only liabilities at December 31, 2009 that are expected to be settled in cash. \n\nThe table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty. \n\nThe contractual obligations related to debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, long-term unfunded investment commitments, estimated claims and claims related payments (gross of the \n\nestimated reinsurance recoveries) and liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, at December 31, 2009 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period (in millions) \n\n&#160;

Because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest, the total long-term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note 8. (2) Represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space, equipment and furniture. (3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services. (4) In connection with the sale of its insurance brokerage operations, the Company committed to acquire brokerage services from the buyer through May 16, 2012. See note 15 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\n(5) Includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and services including office supplies, archival services, etc. (6) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships. (7) The amounts in \"Claims and claim adjustment expenses\" in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables. The Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note 5 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance (see below). The assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities. \n\nReinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in \"Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits\" in the table above. \n\nThe estimated future cash inflows from the Company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; Reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 12,459 &#160; $ 2,582 &#160; $ 3,199 &#160; $ 2,027 &#160; $ 4,651 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expense on a net of reinsurance basis. The estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expenses, net &#160; $ 41,831 &#160; $ 9,448 &#160; $ 11,350 &#160; $ 6,770 &#160; $ 14,263 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2009. \n\nThe amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. (See note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements.) \n\n(8) Workers' compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks 126 \n\nreimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. \"Claims from large deductible policies\" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as \"contractholder payables\" and \"contractholder receivables,\" respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within \"Claims and claim adjustment expenses\" in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table. \n\nThe estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers' compensation policies is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; Contractholder payables/receivables &#160; $ 5,797 &#160; $ 1,442 &#160; $ 1,608 &#160; $ 854 &#160; $ 1,893 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(9) The amounts in \"Loss-based assessments\" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. For loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in \"other liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet. (10) The amounts in \"Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits\" represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits. Amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in \"other liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting. (11) The amounts in \"Payout from ceded funds withheld\" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the Company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held. (12) The Company's gross current and deferred liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $2,126 million. Offsetting these liabilities are current and deferred tax assets in the following amounts associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; Receivables related to unrecognized tax benefits &#160; $ 2,060 &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ 1,669 &#160; $ 391 &#160; $ &#151; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company does not have a best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, any future contributions are not included in the foregoing table. \n\nDividend Availability \n\nThe Company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of Connecticut and Minnesota. The insurance holding company laws of both states applicable to the Company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. \n\nThe insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company's subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $3.49 billion is available by the end of 2010 for such dividends without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department for Connecticut-domiciled subsidiaries and the Minnesota Department of Commerce for Minnesota-domiciled subsidiaries. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2010 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2010, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by those Insurance Departments. The holding company received $3.54 billion of dividends from its domestic insurance subsidiaries in 2009, including a $500 million dividend that received regulatory approval. \n\nRisk-Based Capital \n\nThe NAIC adopted RBC requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action. The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher than RBC requirements. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At December 31, 2009, all of the Company's insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nThe Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to letters of credit, issuance of debt securities, certain investments and various indemnifications, including those related to the sale of business entities. See note 15 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the Company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill impairments. \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and \n\nprojection techniques, at a given accounting date. These loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing loss reserves, the Company also takes into account estimated recoveries, reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. The loss reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. \n\nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. The Company continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different in amount than current loss reserves&#151;favorable or unfavorable. \n\nBecause establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established loss reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. \n\nThere are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge. \n\nA portion of the Company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation, which totaled $3.49 billion at December 31, 2009. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company's future operating results. See the preceding discussion of \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation.\" \n\nGross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; Case &#160; IBNR &#160; Total &#160; Case &#160; IBNR &#160; Total &#160; General liability &#160; $ 6,368 &#160; $ 11,542 &#160; $ 17,910 &#160; $ 6,529 &#160; $ 11,912 &#160; $ 18,441 &#160; Property &#160; &#160; 1,211 &#160; &#160; 771 &#160; &#160; 1,982 &#160; &#160; 1,414 &#160; &#160; 858 &#160; &#160; 2,272 &#160; Commercial multi-peril &#160; &#160; 1,878 &#160; &#160; 1,762 &#160; &#160; 3,640 &#160; &#160; 1,988 &#160; &#160; 1,968 &#160; &#160; 3,956 &#160; Commercial automobile &#160; &#160; 2,262 &#160; &#160; 1,294 &#160; &#160; 3,556 &#160; &#160; 2,413 &#160; &#160; 1,408 &#160; &#160; 3,821 &#160; Workers' compensation &#160; &#160; 9,355 &#160; &#160; 7,122 &#160; &#160; 16,477 &#160; &#160; 9,419 &#160; &#160; 6,872 &#160; &#160; 16,291 &#160; Fidelity and surety &#160; &#160; 661 &#160; &#160; 1,091 &#160; &#160; 1,752 &#160; &#160; 677 &#160; &#160; 1,081 &#160; &#160; 1,758 &#160; Personal automobile &#160; &#160; 1,457 &#160; &#160; 994 &#160; &#160; 2,451 &#160; &#160; 1,448 &#160; &#160; 1,043 &#160; &#160; 2,491 &#160; Homeowners and personal&#151;other &#160; &#160; 633 &#160; &#160; 717 &#160; &#160; 1,350 &#160; &#160; 633 &#160; &#160; 800 &#160; &#160; 1,433 &#160; International and other &#160; &#160; 2,003 &#160; &#160; 1,933 &#160; &#160; 3,936 &#160; &#160; 2,140 &#160; &#160; 2,043 &#160; &#160; 4,183 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Property-casualty &#160; &#160; 25,828 &#160; &#160; 27,226 &#160; &#160; 53,054 &#160; &#160; 26,661 &#160; &#160; 27,985 &#160; &#160; 54,646 &#160; Accident and health &#160; &#160; 64 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 73 &#160; &#160; 68 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 77 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves &#160; $ 25,892 &#160; $ 27,235 &#160; $ 53,127 &#160; $ 26,729 &#160; $ 27,994 &#160; $ 54,723 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe amounts previously disclosed above at December 31, 2008 for general liability and commercial auto IBNR reserves have been increased and decreased by $103 million, respectively, to correct a classification error at December 31, 2008. In addition, the amounts previously disclosed at December 31, 2008 for commercial multi-peril case and IBNR reserves, as well as the total case and IBNR reserves, have been increased and decreased by $172 million, respectively, to correct a classification error at December 31, 2008. These reclassifications had no impact on total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves reported at December 31, 2008. \n\nThe $1.60 billion decline in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2008 primarily reflected ongoing claims and claim adjustment expense activity, including losses incurred and payments, as well as favorable prior year reserve development and payments related to operations in runoff. \n\nAsbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\", \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" and \"Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\" \n\nGeneral Discussion \n\nThe process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. \n\nMultiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each \n\nevaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. \n\nIn most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate. \n\nThe exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. \n\nProperty-casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. \n\nMost general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics, among others. \n\nA basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. \n\nInformed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult. \n\nThe variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. \n\nProduct lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the \n\ntime before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. \n\nA major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. \n\nFor some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being \"low frequency/high severity,\" while lines without this \"large claim\" sensitivity are referred to as \"high frequency/low severity.\" Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable. \n\nClaim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. \n\nActuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. \n\nLastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization. \n\nRisk factors \n\nThe major causes of material uncertainty (\"risk factors\") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently. \n\nSome risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. \n\nThe effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated \n\nwith potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. \n\nThe evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. \n\nWhile some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. \n\nSudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. \n\nActuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves \n\nThe principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company's actuaries are the paid development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method. The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. These are typically referred to as traditional actuarial methods. (See Glossary for an explanation of these methods). \n\nWhile these are the principal methods utilized throughout the Company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The Company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates. \n\nSome components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. In such cases, the Company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the traditional methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as: \n\n&#149; Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available. &#149; Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.) &#149; Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from traditional analysis. &#149; Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental). The results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss \n\ndevelopment to expected development based on the prior review. Additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods. \n\nThe methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. Hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate. \n\nManagement's estimates \n\nAt least once per quarter, certain Company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. \n\nSuch an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform. This is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company's estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. \n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves. \n\nDiscussion of Product Lines \n\nThe following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. \n\nIn order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end loss reserves over a one-year period are provided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, \n\nfrom statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of SPC or TPC. This treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available. \n\nGeneral Liability \n\nGeneral liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7 years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for \"construction defect\" claims). \n\nWhile the majority of general liability coverages are written on an \"occurrence\" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a \"claims-made\" basis. \n\nGeneral liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. In addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect, medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional actuarial methods. \n\nDefense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. Such \"defense within the limits\" policies are most common for \"claims-made\" products. When defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits. \n\nThis line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the \"event\" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving \n\nmultiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure). \n\nThe amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect, medical malpractice and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics. \n\nIn addition to the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and S-curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred development methods. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nGeneral liability risk factors Changes in claim handling philosophies Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions New theories of liability Trends in jury awards Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues Changes in statutes of limitations Changes in the underlying court system Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues Changes in tort law Shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) Changes in settlement patterns (e.g., medical malpractice) \n\nGeneral liability book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from -5% to 14% (averaging \n\n4%) for the Company and from -5% to 7% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Because the high end of the Company's range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the Company has since exited, the Company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 28% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was -5% for 2009, -5% for 2008 and -2% for 2007. The 2009 and 2008 changes primarily reflected significant favorable prior year reserve development, driven by several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The 2007 change was driven by better than expected loss development for recent accident years attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. \n\nProperty \n\nProperty is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. \n\nProperty reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nProperty risk factors Physical concentration of policyholders Availability and cost of local contractors For the more severe catastrophic events, \"demand surge\" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services Local building codes Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake) Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations \n\nProperty book of business risk factors Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -34% to 26% (averaging -7%) for the Company, and from -14% to 7% \n\n(averaging -3%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Because the high end of the Company's range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the Company has since exited, the Company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Property reserves represent approximately 4% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nWhile property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of September 11, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -9% for 2009, -22% for 2008 and -18% for 2007. The 2009 change was primarily driven by better than expected loss development in the 2007 and 2008 accident years for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. In addition, the 2005 accident year experience improved due to the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. The 2008 change was primarily driven by favorable development in the 2007 accident year for certain large property, national programs and ocean marine claim exposures, and improvements in the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. The 2007 change was due to fewer than expected late reported claims related to non-catastrophe weather events that occurred late in 2006 as well as better than expected frequency and severity due in part to changes in the marketplace, such as higher deductibles and lower policy limits. In addition, the property product line experienced better than expected large loss outcomes which were partially attributable to favorable litigation resolutions. \n\nCommercial Multi-Peril \n\nCommercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. \n\nThe reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and property includes larger customers. \n\nSee \"Property risk factors\" and \"General liability risk factors,\" discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril. \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -16% to 2% (averaging -5%) for the Company, and from -5% to 6% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes \n\nis illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nAs discussed above, this line combines general liability and property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -8% for 2009, -16% for 2008 and -8% for 2007. The 2009 and 2008 changes were attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, and enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. Also contributing to the change was improvement in the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. The 2007 change was attributable to better than expected results due to, among other factors, increasingly favorable legal and judicial environments as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. \n\nCommercial Automobile \n\nThe commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nCommercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. \n\nThe Company utilizes the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors Trends in jury awards Changes in the underlying court system Changes in case law Litigation trends Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents Changes in auto safety technology Subrogation opportunities Changes in claim handling philosophies Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Types of medical treatments received Changes in cost of medical treatments Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n\nCommercial automobile book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets) Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -10% to 9% (averaging -2%) for the Company, and from -3% to 9% (averaging 2%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -6% for 2009,-7% for 2008 and -10% for 2007. The 2009 and 2008 changes were a result of better than expected loss development, primarily for recent accident years, which was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, and enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The 2007 change was due to better than expected loss development, for recent accident years, as a result of more favorable legal and judicial environments, claim handling initiatives and, the Company believes, improvements in auto safety technology. \n\nWorkers' Compensation \n\nWorkers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. \n\nWorkers' compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nIndemnity risk factors Time required to recover from the injury Degree of available transitional jobs Degree of legal involvement \n\nChanges in the interpretations and processes of the workers' compensation commissions' oversight of claims(1) Future wage inflation for states that index benefits Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds \n\n(1) These are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers' compensation benefits is valid. Their duties include the determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist. 140 \n\nMedical risk factors Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (\"inflation\") Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Type of medical treatments received Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices Availability of new medical processes and equipment Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n\nGeneral workers' compensation risk factors Frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment Degree of cost shifting between workers' compensation and health insurance \n\nWorkers' compensation book of business risk factors Product mix Injury type mix Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers' compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -2% to 2% (averaging 0%) for the Company, and from -1% to 4% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Workers' compensation reserves represent approximately 31% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -1% in 2009, 1% for 2008 and 0% for 2007. \n\nFidelity and Surety \n\nFidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas, the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies. \n\nSurety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (Large construction projects can take many years to complete.) The frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of the Company's insureds to perform financially. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured's assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nFidelity risk factors Type of business of insured Policy limit and attachment points Third-party claims Coverage litigation Complexity of claims Growth in insureds' operations \n\nSurety risk factors Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims Type of business insured Type of obligation insured Cumulative limits of liability for insured Assets available to mitigate loss Defective workmanship/latent defects Financial strategy of insured Changes in statutory obligations Geographic spread of business \n\nFidelity and Surety book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements) Changes in underwriting standards \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.4% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -10% to 138% (averaging 21%) for the Company, and from -13% to 24% (averaging 5%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Because the high end of the Company's range was due to acquired business in 2004, the Company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nIn general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -7% for 2009, -10% for 2008 and -1% for 2007. The 2009 and 2008 changes were a result of better than expected loss experience for the contract surety business within this product line, primarily driven by favorable settlements on large claims from older accident years. \n\nPersonal Automobile \n\nPersonal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nPersonal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors Trends in jury awards Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy Changes in case law Litigation trends Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents Subrogation opportunities Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Changes in claim handling philosophies \n\nNo-fault risk factors (for selected states and time periods) Effectiveness of no-fault laws Frequency of visits to health providers Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers Types of health providers used Types of medical treatments received Changes in cost of medical treatments Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n\nPersonal automobile book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Changes in underwriting standards Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase \n\n(decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -9% to 1% (averaging -3%) for the Company, and from -4% to 0% (averaging -2%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Personal automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2009, -1% for 2008 and -5% for 2007. The decreases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to better than expected results from changes in claim handling practices as well as initiatives to fight fraud. \n\nHomeowners and Personal Lines Other \n\nHomeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made (or alternatively, the property replacement/repair is performed by the insurer). The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. \n\nThe liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. In addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future. \n\nOverall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. \n\nHomeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nNon-catastrophe risk factors Salvage opportunities Amount of time to return property to residential use Changes in weather patterns Local building codes Litigation trends Trends in jury awards \n\nCatastrophe risk factors Physical concentration of policyholders Availability and cost of local contractors Local building codes Quality of construction of damaged homes Amount of time to return property to residential use For the more severe catastrophic events, \"demand surge\" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services \n\nHomeowners book of business risk factors Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) Degree of concentration of policyholders Changes in underwriting standards Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -31% to 3% (averaging -12%) for the Company, and from -8% to 11% (averaging -2%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 2% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nThis line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -14% for 2009, -13% for 2008 and -3% for 2007. The 2009 change primarily reflected favorable loss experience related to Hurricanes Ike and Katrina, as well as the 2007 California wildfires. The 2008 change was primarily driven by favorable loss experience related to Hurricane Katrina, by claim initiatives, by better than expected outcomes on 2007 catastrophe-related claims and by improvements in older accident years for the umbrella line. The 2007 change was due to fewer than expected late reported claims related to non-catastrophe weather events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, a portion of the change was attributable to a decrease in the number of claims due to changes in the marketplace, including higher deductibles and fewer small-dollar claims. \n\nInternational and other \n\nInternational and other includes products written by International and other products not discussed above. The principal component of \"other\" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff business. \n\nInternational and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. \n\nDue to changes in the business mix for this line over time, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the \n\nspecific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes. \n\nInternational and other reserves are generally analyzed by program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g., U.S. Liability&#151;excess of loss reinsurance, or General Liability&#151;Municipalities&#151;by country). The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage/jurisdiction. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the General Liability and Automobile discussion above, but under a different legal system. Where the underlying hazard is within the U.S., the coverage involved is typically that of General Liability, but on an excess or excess-of-loss reinsurance basis. Excess exposure requires the insured to \"prove\" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy's attachment point. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nInternational and other risk factors Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision New theories of liability Trends in jury awards Changes in the propensity to sue Changes in statutes of limitations Changes in the underlying court system Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues Changes in tort law Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) \n\nInternational and other book of business risk factors Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, \"claims-made\" language) Changes in underwriting standards Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in loss reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 7% of the Company's total loss reserves. \n\nInternational and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the U.S. do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other. \n\nReinsurance Recoverables \n\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. \n\nThe reinsurance agreements that the Company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts and meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The Company's catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in the \"Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage\" section herein. \n\nThe Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the Company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges. \n\nRecoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers' compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally. \n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverable assets: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2009 &#160; 2008 &#160; Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses &#160; $ 8,138 &#160; $ 9,376 &#160; Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance &#160; &#160; (523 ) &#160; (618 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net reinsurance recoverables &#160; &#160; 7,615 &#160; &#160; 8,758 &#160; Structured settlements &#160; &#160; 3,456 &#160; &#160; 3,517 &#160; Mandatory pools and associations &#160; &#160; 1,745 &#160; &#160; 1,957 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 12,816 &#160; $ 14,232 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $1.14 billion decline in net reinsurance recoverables since year-end 2008 reflected cash collections, several commutation agreements and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development. \n\nInvestment Valuation and Impairments \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market assumptions. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: \n\n&#151; Level 1&#151;Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. &#151; Level 2&#151;Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data. &#151; Level 3&#151;Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use. Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements \n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties, i.e., not in a forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of fixed maturity investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. \n\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service (pricing service). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value, which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments. The fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. If quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as Level 2 or Level 3. The Company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction. \n\nFixed Maturities \n\nThe Company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 99% of its fixed maturities. The pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value \n\nmeasurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Additionally, the pricing service uses an Option Adjusted Spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. \n\nThe pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. The market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. For some securities, additional inputs may be necessary. \n\nThe pricing service utilized by the Company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. If the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the Company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for market-based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions. \n\nThe fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices. \n\nThe Company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the Company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market. The Company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%. The Company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value. In addition, the Company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). The Company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio. These processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service. \n\nThe Company holds privately placed corporate bonds and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. The underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the U.S. Treasury curve are the Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index and the Merrill Lynch High Yield BB Rated Index. The Company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in Level 2, since all significant inputs are market observable. As many of these securities are issued by public companies, the Company compares the estimates of fair value to the fair values of these companies' publicly traded debt to test the validity of the internal pricing matrix. \n\nWhile the vast majority of the Company's municipal bonds are included in Level 2, the Company holds a small number of municipal bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of fixed maturities that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (typically a market \n\nmaker). Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. \n\nEquities&#151;Public Common and Preferred \n\nFor public common and preferred stocks, the Company receives prices from a nationally recognized pricing service that are based on observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in Level 1. Infrequently, current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain non-redeemable preferred stocks held by the Company. In these instances, the Company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing service that provides fair value estimates for the Company's fixed maturities. The service utilizes some of the same methodologies to price the non-redeemable preferred stocks as it does for the fixed maturities. The Company includes the fair value estimate for these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in Level 2. \n\nOther Investments \n\nCommon Stock with Transfer Restrictions and Other \n\nThe Company holds one public common stock with transfer restrictions, with a fair value of $213 million. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of this common stock was determined by adjusting the observed market price of the security for a liquidity discount which takes into consideration the restriction on the common stock that existed at December 31, 2009 and is based on market observable inputs. As a result of adjusting the market price to consider the transfer restriction, the Company discloses this security in Level 2. The Company holds investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, with a fair value estimate of $60 million at December 31, 2009, reported in other investments, where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. Due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the Company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these investments at December 31, 2009 in the amount disclosed in Level 3. The Company holds investments in various publicly-traded securities which are reported in other investments. The $46 million fair value of these investments at December 31, 2009 is disclosed in Level 1. These investments include securities in the Company's trading portfolio ($24 million), mutual funds ($15 million) and other small holdings ($7 million). \n\nDerivatives \n\nThe Company holds non-public warrants in a public company and has convertible bonds containing embedded conversion options that are valued separately from the host bond contract. The Company estimates fair value for the warrants using an option pricing model with observable market inputs. Because the warrants are not market traded and information concerning market participants is not available, the Company includes the fair value estimate of $94 million at December 31, 2009 in the amount disclosed in Level 3&#151;other investments. The valuation of the warrants is comprised of two components: the intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the warrant strike price and the current share price of the underlying stock) and a modeled value that represents the additional price that a market participant would be willing to pay to purchase the warrants based on the remaining time to the warrants' expiration, the volatility of the underlying stock, expected dividends and current interest rates. The estimated fair value at December 31, 2009, of $94 million was comprised of $68 million of intrinsic value and $26 million of modeled value. While the value of both components will change as a result of changes in the fair value of the underlying stock, the modeled value will eventually decrease to zero as the expiration date of the warrants, which is November 1, 2012, is approached. \n\nValuation of Investments Not Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements \n\nShort-term Securities \n\nThe Company's short-term securities consist of Aaa-rated registered money market funds and high-quality commercial paper (primarily A1/P1) with a combined average of 27 days to maturity at December 31, 2009. It is the Company's policy to not invest in structured products for its short-term securities. The Company believes that there is insignificant credit risk in its short-term portfolio and that amortized cost approximates fair value. The Company includes short-term securities in its impairment monitoring to identify any credit issues. \n\nReal Estate \n\nReal estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals, using discounted cash flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques. Real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at the Company's cost, less accumulated depreciation. \n\nOther Investments \n\nThe Company's investment portfolio includes other investments not carried at fair value which include private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships (together, partnerships) and mortgage loans. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in partnerships, and amortized cost is used for mortgage loans. \n\nThe partnerships and the hedge funds generally report investments on their balance sheet at fair value. The financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the Company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent upon the type of underlying investments. The private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the Company, within three to six months following the date of the reporting period. The hedge funds provide financial information monthly, which is generally available to investors within one month following the date of the reporting period. The Company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships' financial statements, and records any material information obtained from these requests in the financial statements. \n\nInvestment Impairments \n\nThe Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. Some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1) for fixed maturity investments, whether the Company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2) for non-fixed maturity investments, the Company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e., whether there is a credit loss), or cost for equity securities; (4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices. \n\nReporting of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments \n\nFor fixed maturity investments that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, \n\nthe Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). The impairment related to all other factors is reported in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources. \n\nFor non-fixed maturity investments and fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses). \n\nUpon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments, the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment. \n\nDue to the subjective nature of the Company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. \n\nDetermination of Credit Loss \n\nThe Company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine the present value of the security and comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security. If the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows, the difference is considered a credit loss and recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). \n\nFor non-structured fixed maturities (U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. Government and government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, debt securities issued by foreign governments and certain corporate debt) the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. The determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of valuation methods as deemed appropriate by the Company. The Company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the Company's assessment of the priority of claims. The present value of the cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame. Generally, that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is 12 months. For securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally 24 months. Included in the present value calculation are expected principal and interest payments; however, for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single recovery amount. \n\nIn estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to, revenue, margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional debt to be incurred pre- or post- bankruptcy/restructuring, the ability to shift existing or new debt to different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of \n\nunfunded pension obligations, litigation or other contingent claims, the treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts. \n\nFor structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities), the Company estimates the present value of the security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure of the securitization, and determining the present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). The Company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in the securitization, along with other economic data, to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the securitization. In order to project cash flows, the following assumptions are applied to the assets underlying the securitization: (1) voluntary prepayment rates, (2) default rates and (3) loss severity. The key assumptions made for the Prime, Alt-A and Sub-Prime mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2009 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2009) \n\n&#160; Prime &#160; Alt-A &#160; Sub-Prime Voluntary prepayment rates &#160; 2% - 15% &#160; 1% - 8% &#160; 1% - 6% Percentage of remaining pool liquidated due to defaults &#160; 5% - 55% &#160; 23% - 75% &#160; 31% - 90% Loss severity &#160; 35% - 60% &#160; 50% - 75% &#160; 70% - 80% ##TABLE_END\n\nChanges in Intent to Sell Temporarily Impaired Assets \n\nThe Company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date. Conversely, the Company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date. Such changes in intent are generally due to events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date. The types of events that may result in a change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset (e.g., a downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency), significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment. \n\nReal Estate Investments \n\nOn at least an annual basis, the Company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments. In addition, the carrying value of all real estate property is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The review for impairment considers the valuation from the independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. An impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property. The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. \n\nOther Investments \n\nInvestments in Private Equity Limited Partnerships, Hedge Funds and Real Estate Partnerships \n\nThe Company reviews these investments for impairment no less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers/general partners. If the Company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership's investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the partnership's financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income. \n\nMortgage Loans \n\nA mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect principal and interest amounts due. For mortgage loans that are determined to be impaired, a reserve is established for the difference between the amortized cost and the fair market value of the underlying collateral. In estimating fair value, the Company uses interest rates reflecting the current real estate financing market returns. The Company did not have any impaired mortgage loans at December 31, 2009 and 2008. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairments \n\nThe Company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the Company's three operating and reportable segments: Business Insurance, Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance, and Personal Insurance. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to their carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying values of the reporting units exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment is calculated and goodwill is adjusted accordingly. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed its methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units from a multiple of earnings model to a discounted cash flow model. This change was made as a result of the effects of a severe disruption of the credit and equity markets and significant changes in the insurance industry that caused disparities between the multiple of earnings of the Company and the observed multiple of earnings of its competitors. The discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a more detailed analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is more representative of the Company's reporting units' current and expected future financial performance. The change in methodology resulted in a change in estimate of the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the Company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis. The classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is reassessed, and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. \n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. The carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment in value. Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. \n\nThe Company's review did not result in an impairment of its indefinite-lived or finite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. \n\nOTHER UNCERTAINTIES \n\nFor a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see note 15 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors.\" \n\nFUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards updates. \n\nThe Company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). During 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a proposed Roadmap for comment for the potential use in filings with the SEC of financial statements \n\nfor U.S. issuers prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), instead of in accordance with GAAP. The Roadmap contains milestones that, if achieved, may lead the SEC to decide in 2011 to require the use of IFRS for large accelerated filers, including the Company, in 2014. The SEC is expected to re-deliberate the proposed Roadmap in 2011 based on the comments received. The IASB and the FASB are in the process of developing a global insurance standard that may involve methodologies for valuing insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by current GAAP. The FASB and the IASB are also embarked on a long-term project to converge GAAP and IFRS. The Company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt IFRS or how the adoption of IFRS (or the convergence of GAAP and IFRS) may impact the Company's financial statements in the future. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report contains, and management may make, certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
