Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS \n\nThe Company franchises and operates McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. Of the 36,525 &#32;restaurants in 119 &#32;countries at year-end 2015 , 30,081 &#32;were franchised (reflects 21,147 &#32;franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,529 &#32;licensed to developmental licensees and 3,405 &#32;licensed to foreign affiliates (\"affiliates\")&#8212;primarily Japan) and 6,444 &#32;were operated by the Company. \n\nUnder McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and d&#233;cor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. \n\nUnder McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. \n\nMcDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be 95% franchised over the long term. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. \n\nThrough June 30, 2015, the Company was managed as distinct geographic segments, comprised of the U.S., Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Other Countries &#38; Corporate, which included Canada and Latin America. Beginning July 1, 2015, McDonald&#8217;s started operating under a new organizational structure with the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nU.S. &#32;- the Company's largest segment. This segment did not change as a result of the new reporting structure. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInternational Lead Markets &#32;- established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nHigh Growth Markets &#32;- markets believed to have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and related markets. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nFoundational Markets &#38; Corporate &#32;- the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, each of which is believed to have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. \n\n##TABLE_END In September 2015, the Company issued segment summary financial information and segment historical data in accordance with its new reporting structure for the previously reported years ended 2010 through 2014 and quarters ended March 31, 2014 through June 30, 2015. The segment information included herein is presented in accordance with the change in reporting structure for all periods presented. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 , the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets segments accounted for 34% , 30% &#32;and 24% &#32;of total revenues, respectively. \n\nIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating income growth and returns. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company&#8217;s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company&#8217;s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 13 \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nReturn on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. \n\n##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\nThe strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the \"System\") has been key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald&#8217;s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, the Company&#8217;s business model enables the System to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities it serves. \n\nIn 2015, the Company and its Board of Directors took steps to reset its business and restore growth, which included the election of a new CEO in the first quarter. In May, management announced the initial steps of the Company's turnaround plan, beginning with a worldwide restructuring in July. This resulted in a reorganization from a geographically-focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. This new operating structure is designed to sharpen the Company's focus on the customer, drive greater accountability, and remove distractions and bureaucracy. Management expects the new structure to enable faster decision-making and an increased ability to move proven initiatives quickly across markets. \n\nThe System is focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants by providing customers with what matters most to them - hot and fresh food, fast and friendly service, and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonald&#8217;s. In addition, McDonald&#8217;s is building on its competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification and System alignment that have been created over time. \n\nMcDonald&#8217;s aspires to be viewed by its customers as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience. The priorities of the turnaround plan are threefold: drive operational growth, create brand excitement and enhance financial value. \n\nTo drive operational growth, the Company is working to enhance the quality, choice and variety of its menu. In addition, the Company is building upon investments it has already made in reimaging and technology to innovate the way customers can order and how they are served, which represent elements of the Experience of the Future. While execution and timing of these elements may be different in each market, Experience of the Future is designed to fundamentally enhance McDonald's relationship with customers and their experience with the brand. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s brand efforts aim to reach customers in ways that drive greater excitement and are meaningful to them, such as fun, engaging marketing campaigns and focused support of communities. Enhancements to the quality of McDonald's menu, more local sourcing of ingredients, and commitments around sustainability efforts are all designed to improve consumer confidence in the Brand. \n\nThe modifications to McDonald&#8217;s operating approach are accompanied by strategies to enhance financial value. In 2015, management announced plans to optimize the Company&#8217;s restaurant ownership mix by refranchising about 4,000 restaurants through 2018, deliver net annual G&#38;A savings of about $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the \n\n&#160;\n\nend of 2017, and return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. \n\nMcDonald&#8217;s maintains a strong financial foundation supported by industry-leading unit volumes that enable the Company to pursue growth through business and economic cycles while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year. Cash from operations benefits from a heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables co-investment, either through capital expenditures or rent incentives, with franchisees on key initiatives, such as reimaging. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive as franchisees invest in the costs of going into business and most future reinvestment. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s substantial cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provides McDonald&#8217;s flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. After a thorough evaluation of financial opportunities, management announced plans to optimize the Company&#8217;s capital structure and increased the cash return to shareholders target to about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016 - a $10 billion increase over the previous target with incremental debt funding the vast majority of the increase. This proactive move in the Company&#8217;s leverage metrics and credit ratings still enables McDonald&#8217;s to efficiently and cost effectively access capital globally, while allowing for continued investment in the business. These actions, together with the decision of the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in 2015, reflect the Board and management&#8217;s confidence in McDonald's future. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial results for 2015 reflect two distinct performance periods. During the first half of the year, the Company took bold and urgent action to reset the business and refocus the System on its customers; however, operating performance was weak. The second half of the year was about execution, with results turning positive and providing tangible evidence that the turnaround plan is working. \n\nIn McDonald&#8217;s heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns. Global comparable sales increased 1.5% in 2015, driven by positive performance across all segments in the third and fourth quarters. Consolidated guest counts were negative for the year. \n\nU.S. comparable sales increased 0.5% and comparable guest counts declined 3.0%, though performance improved sequentially throughout the year with positive comparable sales in the third and fourth quarters. \n\nComparable sales in the International Lead markets grew 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. All major markets contributed to the positive comparable sales performance except France, which was impacted by macro-economic headwinds. \n\nIn the High Growth markets, comparable sales increased 1.8% and comparable guest counts declined 2.2%. The increase in comparable sales was driven primarily by solid performance in China as the market successfully executed strong recovery plans following the prior year supplier issue. &#32; \n\nComparable sales in the Foundational markets increased 0.7% and comparable guest counts declined 3.7%. Solid performance in many markets across Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East were offset by negative comparable sales and guest counts in Japan. \n\n14 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report \n\nRESULTS FOR THE YEAR: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGlobal comparable sales increased 1.5%, reflecting an increase in all segments. Comparable guest counts declined 2.3%, as positive guest traffic in the International Lead markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in all other segments. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSystemwide sales, a non-GAAP measure that includes franchised sales, decreased 6% (increased 3% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConsolidated revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nConsolidated operating income decreased 10% (flat in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nDiluted earnings per share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. Results and comparisons were impacted by the following current and prior year items outside normal operations: \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * \n\nStrategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring activities and incremental restaurant closings primarily in China, Japan and the U.S., were partly offset by a gain on sale of property in the U.S. These items had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * \n\nCharges related to certain foreign tax matters and the China supplier issue had a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in 2014. \n\n##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2% in 2015. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCash provided by operations was $6.5 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nOne-year ROIIC was 1.5% and three-year ROIIC was negative 3.7% for the period ended December 31, 2015 &#32; (see reconciliation on page 28). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.89 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.56 per share. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nThe Company returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year. This brings the cumulative return to shareholders to $15.8 billion for the two-year period ending 2015 versus the targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCapital expenditures of $1.8 billion were split fairly evenly between new restaurant openings and reinvestment in existing restaurants. Across the System, about 1,000 restaurants were opened and over 1,000 existing locations were reimaged. \n\n##TABLE_END AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENT \n\nU.S. \n\nAs the Company's largest segment, the U.S. remains critical to the Company's turnaround given its significant contribution to consolidated results. While results in the first half of 2015 were weak, the steps taken to enhance menu quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer more convenience to customers led to a meaningful shift in momentum starting in the third quarter. \n\nMenu initiatives in the U.S. include enhancing the taste of core products through new cooking procedures and continuing to evolve its menu and ingredients, including the introduction of the \n\n&#160;\n\nArtisan Grilled Chicken and Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwiches. The October launch of All Day Breakfast built on the positive momentum experienced during the third quarter. McDonald&#8217;s ability to move from one test market in April to a national launch in October in over 13,000 restaurants is a testament to the cultural changes the Company is making to become more relevant to customers. \n\nThe U.S. is placing a renewed emphasis on running great restaurants. This includes simplifying the menu and operations and making it easier for guests to order and interact with the Brand. Customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. \n\nThe recent launch of McDonald&#8217;s mobile app in the U.S. is designed to capture additional demand and engage with customers in more fun, personal and relevant ways. \n\nGiven the importance of value to its customers, the U.S. is working to establish a consistent national value offering. The goal is to provide customers more choice and flexibility, including the opportunity to bundle their own meals at compelling price points. \n\nInternational Lead Markets \n\nThe International Lead markets remain relentlessly focused on customers and using data insights to better understand and respond to their changing needs and expectations. \n\nThese markets are focused on food quality, which includes modernizing cooking and service platforms to serve hotter, fresher food. Local market initiatives include new recipes and quality ingredients, such as a range of new Signature Beef products in the U.K. \n\nThe International Lead markets are working to improve the restaurant experience with a focus on customizing the menu for individual tastes, and offering customers different ways to order, pay for or receive their food. Markets continue to test solutions like self-order kiosks, table service and curbside delivery that help restaurant teams better connect with and serve customers because they simplify operations. These solutions also enable restaurants to accommodate more customers during busy peak times, thereby driving overall business performance. \n\nMarkets are at different stages, but all are making steady progress towards enhancing the customer experience. France is the furthest along with digital, web ordering, self-order kiosks and table service in the majority of restaurants. Australia's platform focuses on personalization and customization of premium burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads ordered through self-order kiosks. Canada and the U.K. have a number of Experience of the Future restaurants in place today and have plans to deploy more broadly in 2016. \n\nThe International Lead markets continue to focus on sustainability and social responsibility to become an even more relevant and trusted brand. \n\nHigh Growth Markets \n\nMcDonald's High Growth markets are focused on creating customer excitement through menu, promotions and value, and implementing a digital strategy with specific mobile solutions and actions to build the business and brand trust. \n\nIn addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. \n\nNew restaurant openings totaled over 400 in 2015, while net additions were over 200. Between 400-500 total openings are planned for 2016, primarily in China, with a strong emphasis on freestanding restaurants with drive-thru&#8217;s. The High Growth markets include about half of the System&#8217;s planned global openings for 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 15 \n\nFoundational Markets \n\nThe Foundational markets span over 80 countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. This diverse group of markets share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate McDonald&#8217;s - the menu and the customer experience. Menu efforts include emphasizing core favorites and ensuring strong everyday value platforms are in place, complemented by exciting new menu news tailored to local tastes and flavor preferences. The markets are placing a renewed commitment on running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery. \n\nThe segment is pursuing refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. McDonald's is also exploring the sale of a portion of the Company&#8217;s ownership in McDonald&#8217;s Japan to a strategic investor who could help advance Japan&#8217;s turnaround efforts, unlock the market&#8217;s growth potential, and enhance value for all stakeholders. \n\nOUTLOOK FOR 2016 &#32; \n\nAs McDonald's continues to execute its turnaround plan in 2016, the Company is confident that these strategies will transform customer perceptions of McDonald's as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary experience. \n\nAlthough some larger markets face challenging headwinds as the Company enters 2016, McDonald's expects continued positive top-line momentum across all segments. McDonald's System is committed to elevating every aspect of the customer experience with the essential imperative of running great restaurants. \n\nWhile the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company&#8217;s future results. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nChanges in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2016 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead Markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWith about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2016, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to decrease about 1-2% in the U.S. and remain relatively flat in the International Lead Markets segment. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects full-year 2016 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1-2% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. This includes expenses associated with our Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in second quarter 2016 and sponsorship of the Summer Olympic games in third quarter 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nBased on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2016 to increase about 40-45% compared with 2015 due to higher average debt balances. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 30% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by up to 25 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2016 to be in the 31%-33% range. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects capital expenditures for 2016 to be approximately $2.0 billion, about half of which will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,000 restaurants, including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental-licensee markets where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 500 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 400 to 500 reimages in the U.S. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company plans to optimize its capital structure and expects to return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. The cumulative return for the two years ended 2015 was nearly $16 billion, leaving about $14 billion to be completed in 2016. Some of this remaining amount will be funded by issuing additional debt, of which approximately $6 billion was issued in the fourth quarter 2015. \n\n##TABLE_END Long-term \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the four-year period ending 2018 with a long-term goal to become 95% franchised. The majority of the refranchising will take place in the High Growth and Foundational markets. During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects to realize net annual G&#38;A savings of about $500 million from our G&#38;A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017. These savings will be realized through our refranchising efforts, streamlining resources across corporate, segment and market organizations, primarily in non-customer facing functions, and realizing greater efficiencies in the Company's Global Business Services platform. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize a cumulative total of about $150 million in savings by the end of 2016, with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn connection with executing against our refranchising and G&#38;A targets, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n16 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report \n\nConsolidated Operating Results \n\n##TABLE_START Operating results \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars and shares in millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,169 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,875 \n\nRevenues from franchised restaurants \n\n&#160; \n\n8,925 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,272 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,231 \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n25,413 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27,441 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n28,106 \n\nOperating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany-operated restaurant expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n13,977 \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15,288 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15,579 \n\nFranchised restaurants-occupancy expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n1,647 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,697 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,624 \n\nSelling, general &#38; administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n2,434 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,386 \n\nOther operating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nn/m \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nn/m \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(247 \n\n) \n\nTotal operating costs and expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n18,267 \n\n(6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n19,492 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n19,342 \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n7,146 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,949 \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,764 \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNonoperating (income) expense, net \n\n&#160; \n\n(48 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nn/m \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nn/m \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome before provision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n6,556 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,372 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,204 \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n2,027 \n\n&#160; \n\n(22 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,618 \n\nNet income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,529 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,758 \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,586 \n\nEarnings per common share&#8212;diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.80 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.82 \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.55 \n\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding&#8212; \n\ndiluted \n\n&#160; \n\n944.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n986.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,006.0 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nn/m Not meaningful \n\nIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS \n\nWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald&#8217;s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows. \n\nForeign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years. In 2015, results were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble and most other currencies. &#32; In 2014, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 &#32;on diluted earnings per share. \n\nIn 2014, net income decreased 15% (13% in constant currencies) to $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per common share decreased 13% (11% in constant currencies) to $4.82. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.12 on diluted earnings per share. \n\nResults in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on sale of property in the U.S., partly offset by strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset \n\n&#160;\n\nwrite-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. The strategic charges and gain on sale of property in the U.S. had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015. \n\nResults in 2014 were negatively impacted by the following items that had a negative impact of $0.54 on diluted earnings per share: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$0.31 per share due to an increase in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as an increase in tax reserves related to audit progression in other foreign tax jurisdictions. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 17 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n$0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of a supplier issue in China. As a consequence, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with customer recovery efforts. \n\n##TABLE_END Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, in 2015 earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2%. In 2014, diluted earnings per share would have reflected a decrease of 3% (1% in constant currencies) excluding the 2014 charges related to certain foreign \n\n&#160;\n\ntax matters and the China supplier issue. This supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of significant items outside of normal operations. \n\nThe Company repurchased 61.8 million &#32;shares of its stock for $6.2 billion &#32;in 2015 &#32;and 33.1 million &#32;shares of its stock for $3.2 billion &#32;in 2014 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nREVENUES \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. \n\nThe Company is accelerating the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales. \n\nIn 2015 , constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion. In 2014, constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales, partially offset by expansion. \n\n##TABLE_START Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) \n\nexcluding currency \n\ntranslation \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars in millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany-operated sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,198 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,351 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,512 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\nInternational Lead Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n4,798 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,443 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,513 \n\n&#160; \n\n(12 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\nHigh Growth Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n5,442 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,071 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFoundational Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n2,050 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,304 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,488 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,169 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,875 \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\nFranchised revenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,361 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,339 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\nInternational Lead Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n2,817 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,101 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,023 \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHigh Growth Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFoundational Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n1,016 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,097 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,148 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,925 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,272 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,231 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal revenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,559 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,651 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,851 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n%) \n\nInternational Lead Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n7,615 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,544 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,536 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHigh Growth Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n6,173 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,845 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,043 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFoundational Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n3,066 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,401 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,676 \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25,413 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,441 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,106 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUS: In 2015, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact from refranchising.

These items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate. \n\nIn 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. \n\nConsolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.8 billion &#32;in 2015 &#32;and $1.6 billion &#32;in 2014 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer by one year the effective date of its new standard to January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017. \n\nThe new standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach. The Company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions, such as initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms. \n\n##TABLE_START Cash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\nCash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.7 billion in 2015, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.1 billion in 2014. In 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014, primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity. This was partly offset by changes in working capital. In 2014, cash provided by operations decreased $390 million or 5% compared with 2013 primarily due to lower operating results, partly offset by lower income tax payments. \n\nCash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion in 2014, a decrease of $369 million compared with 2013. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures, a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits and higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. \n\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher \n\n&#160;\n\ntreasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $575 million compared with 2013, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in net borrowings. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash and equivalents balance was $7.7 billion and $2.1 billion at year end 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2015 was due to higher net borrowings to be used primarily for share repurchases in 2016. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. \n\nRESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n\nIn 2015, the Company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. In 2014, the Company opened 1,316 restaurants and closed 487 restaurants. The increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants.

In December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2014 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2016, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. \n\nOn February 12, 2016, the Company paid $2.7 billion under an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement and received an initial delivery of 18.5 million shares, which represents 80% of the total shares the Company expects to receive based on the market price at the time of initial delivery. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement, between April 1, 2016 and May 13, 2016, will be determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the Company&#8217;s common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. \n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 40 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2015 full year dividend of $ 3.44 &#32;per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.85 per share, with an increase to $0.89 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.56 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company&#8217;s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Financial Position and Capital Resources \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS \n\nTotal assets increased $3.7 billion or 11% in 2015. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $5.8 billion in 2015 primarily due to higher cash and equivalents. Nearly 75% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2015. Net property and equipment decreased $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and foreign currency translation, partly offset by capital expenditures, and represented about 60% of total assets at year end. \n\nOperating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. \n\nReturns on assets and equity \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReturn on average assets \n\n20.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.8 \n\n% \n\nReturn on average common equity \n\n45.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n31.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n35.8 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets, while return on average common equity increased primarily due to lower average common equity as a result of higher treasury stock purchases. In 2014, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower operating results. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. \n\nFINANCING AND MARKET RISK \n\nThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2015 totaled $24.1 billion, compared with $15.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The net increase in 2015 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $9.7 billion in connection with the Company's plans to optimize its capital structure. \n\nDebt highlights (1) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed-rate debt as a percent of total \n\ndebt (2,3) \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWeighted-average annual interest \n\nrate of total debt (3) \n\n3.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\nForeign currency-denominated debt \n\nas a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal debt as a percent of total \n\ncapitalization (total debt and total \n\nShareholders' equity) (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations as a \n\npercent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nAll percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nBased on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company&#8217;s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#8217;s business. Under existing authorization from the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2015, the Company had $4.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2016 is $787 million of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's subsidiaries also had $732 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. \n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. \n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders&#8217; equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $7.0 billion and $5.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company&#8217;s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. \n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to certain derivatives having negative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company&#8217;s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company&#8217;s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: \n\nForeign currency net asset exposures \n\n##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nEuro \n\n$ \n\n3,974 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,949 \n\nBritish Pounds Sterling \n\n1,333 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,460 \n\nAustralian Dollars \n\n1,316 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,038 \n\nCanadian Dollars \n\n1,096 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,231 \n\nRussian Ruble \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company&#8217;s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2015 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2015 levels would materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. \n\nLIQUIDITY \n\nThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2015 . We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds. \n\nConsistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. \n\nWhile the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 25 \n\ntax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2015 . See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nContractual cash outflows \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual cash inflows \n\n&#160; \n\nIn millions \n\nOperating \n\nleases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDebt \n\nobligations (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMinimum rent under \n\nfranchise arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,350 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,628 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,235 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,065 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,534 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,113 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,755 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,449 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,001 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,844 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,355 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,464 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,240 \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n6,921 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15,098 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18,133 \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,515 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,226 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,339 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nThe maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.4 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2019. Debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest. \n\n##TABLE_END In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2015 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $488 million . \n\nIn addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $781 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . \n\nThere are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company&#8217;s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START Other Matters \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nManagement&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its \n\n&#160;\n\nestimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\nThe Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nProperty and equipment \n\n##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management&#8217;s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nShare-based compensation \n\n##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. \n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLong-lived assets impairment review \n\n##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company&#8217;s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company&#8217;s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. \n\n26 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLitigation accruals \n\n##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after \n\ncareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nIncome taxes \n\n##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. \n\nThe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. \n\nIn 2015, the Company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. In 2014, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $505 million, most of which came from foreign-related tax matters. After considering the impact of deferred tax offsets, interest and penalties, these foreign-related tax matters negatively impacted the effective tax rate by 4.1%. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2014 and 2015 are described below. \n\nIn 2014, the Company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 2003-2010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $188 million. In 2015, the Company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal the 2014 unfavorable lower tax court ruling. As a result of this new information, the Company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. No cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the Company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. \n\nIn 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) concluded its field examination of the Company&#8217;s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS. The liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate. In early 2015, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report for these agreed adjustments and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. \n\n&#160;\n\nAlso in 2014 in connection with the IRS examination of 2009-2010, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the IRS. As a result of this new information in 2014, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2016 or 2017. \n\nIn 2014, the Company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million. The Company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits. In 2015, there was no significant progression on these audits. \n\nIn December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. \n\nWhile the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;). \n\nDeferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.9 billion &#32;related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. \n\nEFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES&#8212;INFLATION \n\nThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 27 \n\nRECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL \n\nROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company&#8217;s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. \n\nThe denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter&#8217;s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2015 &#32;investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2015 &#32;investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2014 &#32;is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2015 &#32;operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2014 &#32;investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. \n\nThe reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: \n\nOne-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, \n\n&#160;
