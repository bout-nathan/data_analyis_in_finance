Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled &#8220;Forward-Looking Information&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, solutions, features and platform capabilities. \n\nOur mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things integration and our professional cloud services, provide the next-generation platform of enterprise applications and services to enable customer success. Key elements of our strategy include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nstrengthening our market-leading solutions; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nexpanding strategic relationships with customers; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nextending distribution into new and high-growth product categories; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nexpanding our world-class sales organization; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nreducing customer attrition; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nbuilding our business in top software markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help add customers; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nencouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. \n\n##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers&#8217; willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers&#8217; willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers&#8217; ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers&#8217; purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. \n\nTo address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the announcement of our Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, and Internet of Things, or IoT, Cloud, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and App Cloud core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. \n\nWe also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis in some future quarters. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2016 &#32;and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017. Our operating margin for fiscal 2016 &#32;was $114.9 &#32;million compared to a $145.6 &#32;million loss during the same period a year ago. \n\nOur typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 , which is favorable compared to the nine to ten percent attrition rate as of January 31, 2015 . We expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. \n\nWe expect marketing and sales costs, which were 49 &#32;percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 &#32;and 51 percent &#32;for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness. \n\nFiscal Year \n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2016 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016 . \n\nOperating Segments \n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and &#32; our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nSources of Revenues \n\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. &#8220;Other revenue&#8221; consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent &#32;of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a &#8220;customer&#8221; as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a &#8220;subscription&#8221; as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a &#8220;subscriber.&#8221; The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;or 2014 . \n\nSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. \n\nProfessional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. \n\nIn determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8212;Revenue Recognition&#8221; below. \n\nRevenue by Cloud Service Offering \n\nWe are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. \n\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance- Percent \n\nSales Cloud \n\n$ \n\n2,699.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,443.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nService Cloud \n\n1,817.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,320.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nApp Cloud and Other \n\n1,034.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n745.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMarketing Cloud \n\n654.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n505.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n6,205.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,013.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSubscription and support revenues from the Analytics Cloud and Communities Cloud were not significant for fiscal 2016. Since the launch of IoT Cloud in September 2015, we have been piloting this offering with several enterprises. Analytics Cloud revenue is included with App Cloud and Other in the table above. Communities Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or App Cloud and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. \n\nIn situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer&#8217;s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , based on customers&#8217; estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. \n\nAdditionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our App Cloud to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customer&#8217;s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer&#8217;s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customer&#8217;s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful. \n\nOur Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. We estimate that for fiscal 2017 , subscription and support revenues from the Sales Cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues, and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on Sales Cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings. \n\nSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow \n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2016 , which is consistent with fiscal 2015. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. \n\nThe sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nApril 30, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 31, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 31, 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nJanuary 31, 2016 \n\nFiscal 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounts receivable, net \n\n$ \n\n926,381 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,067,799 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,060,726 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,496,165 \n\nDeferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n3,056,820 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,034,991 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,846,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,291,553 \n\nOperating cash flow (1) \n\n730,857 \n\n&#160; \n\n304,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n117,907 \n\n&#160; \n\n459,410 \n\nUnbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure \n\n6.0 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n6.2 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n6.7 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n7.1 bn \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nApril 30, 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 31, 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 31, 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\nJanuary 31, 2015 \n\nFiscal 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounts receivable, net \n\n$ \n\n684,155 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n834,323 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n794,590 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,905,506 \n\nDeferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n2,324,615 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,352,904 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,223,977 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,321,449 \n\nOperating cash flow (1) \n\n473,087 \n\n&#160; \n\n245,893 \n\n&#160; \n\n122,511 \n\n&#160; \n\n332,223 \n\nUnbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure \n\n4.8 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n5.4 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n5.7 bn \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nApril 30, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 31, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 31, 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\nJanuary 31, 2014 \n\nFiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounts receivable, net \n\n$ \n\n502,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n599,543 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n604,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,360,837 \n\nDeferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n1,733,160 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,789,648 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,734,619 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,522,115 \n\nOperating cash flow (1) \n\n283,189 \n\n&#160; \n\n183,183 \n\n&#160; \n\n137,859 \n\n&#160; \n\n271,238 \n\nUnbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure \n\n3.6 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n3.8 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 bn \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 bn \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnbilled Deferred Revenue, a Non-GAAP Measure \n\nThe GAAP deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is a non-GAAP operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $7.1 billion &#32;as of January 31, 2016 &#32;and approximately $5.7 billion &#32;as of January 31, 2015 . Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. \n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses \n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. \n\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. \n\nResearch and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. \n\nWe expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. \n\nMarketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. \n\nWe plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. \n\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. \n\nStock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. \n\nDuring fiscal 2016 , we recognized stock-based expense of $593.6 million . As of January 31, 2016 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $1.6 billion . We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $626.1 million &#32;during fiscal 2017 ; $481.0 million &#32;during fiscal 2018 ; $340.6 million &#32;during fiscal 2019 &#32;and $157.1 million &#32;during fiscal 2020 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2016 &#32;and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. \n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#8217;s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRevenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. &#8220;Other revenue&#8221; consists primarily of training fees. \n\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthere is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe service has been or is being provided to the customer; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. \n\n##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. \n\nSubscription and Support Revenues \n\nSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. \n\nProfessional Services and Other Revenues \n\nThe majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. \n\nMultiple Deliverable Arrangements \n\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer&#8217;s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. \n\nMultiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (&#8220;VSOE&#8221;), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (&#8220;BESP&#8221;), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (&#8220;TPE&#8221;) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. \n\nFor certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. \n\nWe determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. \n\nDeferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. \n\nDeferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. \n\nDeferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer&#8217;s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. \n\nDuring fiscal 2016 , we deferred $380.0 million &#32;of commission expenditures and we amortized $319.1 million &#32;to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $320.9 million &#32;of commission expenditures and we amortized $257.6 \n\nmillion &#32;to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $449.1 million &#32;at January 31, 2016 &#32;and $388.2 million &#32;at January 31, 2015 . \n\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software Costs . We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (&#8220;ASC 350&#8221;), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard. \n\nCosts related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. \n\nBusiness Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. \n\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfuture expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe acquired company&#8217;s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nuncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndiscount rates. \n\n##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \n\nGoodwill and Intangibles. &#32;We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. \n\nIncome Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. \n\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. \n\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. \n\nStrategic Investments. &#32;We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (&#8220;ASC 323&#8221;), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost and presented in the consolidated balance sheet. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323 to account for such investments. \n\nWe determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, the investee&#8217;s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investee&#8217;s liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investee&#8217;s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. \n\nIf the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription and support \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,205,599 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,013,764 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,824,542 \n\nProfessional services and other \n\n&#160; \n\n461,617 \n\n&#160; \n\n359,822 \n\n&#160; \n\n246,461 \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n6,667,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,373,586 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,071,003 \n\nCost of revenues (1)(2): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription and support \n\n&#160; \n\n1,188,967 \n\n&#160; \n\n924,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n711,880 \n\nProfessional services and other \n\n&#160; \n\n465,581 \n\n&#160; \n\n364,632 \n\n&#160; \n\n256,548 \n\nTotal cost of revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n1,654,548 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,289,270 \n\n&#160; \n\n968,428 \n\nGross profit \n\n&#160; \n\n5,012,668 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,084,316 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,102,575 \n\nOperating expenses (1)(2): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n946,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n792,917 \n\n&#160; \n\n623,798 \n\nMarketing and sales \n\n&#160; \n\n3,239,824 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,757,096 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,168,132 \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n748,238 \n\n&#160; \n\n679,936 \n\n&#160; \n\n596,719 \n\nOperating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont \n\n&#160; \n\n(36,617 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n4,897,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,229,949 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,388,649 \n\nIncome (loss) from operations \n\n&#160; \n\n114,923 \n\n&#160; \n\n(145,633 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(286,074 \n\n) \n\nInvestment income \n\n&#160; \n\n15,341 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,038 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,218 \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n(72,485 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(73,237 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(77,211 \n\n) \n\nOther expense (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(15,292 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19,878 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,868 \n\n) \n\nGain on sales of land and building improvements \n\n&#160; \n\n21,792 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,625 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n64,279 \n\n&#160; \n\n(213,085 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(357,935 \n\n) \n\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n(111,705 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(49,603 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n125,760 \n\nNet loss \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(47,426 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(262,688 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(232,175 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Cost of revenues and marketing and sales expenses include the following amounts related to amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n80,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n90,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n109,356 \n\nMarketing and sales \n\n&#160; \n\n77,152 \n\n&#160; \n\n64,673 \n\n&#160; \n\n37,179 \n\nOther non-operating expense \n\n&#160; \n\n3,636 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(2) Cost of revenues and operating expenses include the following amounts related to stock-based expenses (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n69,443 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n53,812 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n45,608 \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n129,434 \n\n&#160; \n\n121,193 \n\n&#160; \n\n107,420 \n\nMarketing and sales \n\n&#160; \n\n289,152 \n\n&#160; \n\n286,410 \n\n&#160; \n\n258,571 \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n105,599 \n\n&#160; \n\n103,350 \n\n&#160; \n\n91,681 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmericas \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,910,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,868,329 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,899,837 \n\nEurope \n\n&#160; \n\n1,162,808 \n\n&#160; \n\n984,919 \n\n&#160; \n\n741,220 \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\n593,663 \n\n&#160; \n\n520,338 \n\n&#160; \n\n429,946 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,667,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,373,586 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,071,003 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 95 percent , 94 percent &#32;and 96 percent &#32;for fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively.

On a constant currency basis, total revenues grew 27 &#32;percent. Subscription and support revenues were $6.2 billion , or 93 percent &#32;of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $5.0 billion , or 93 percent &#32;of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase &#32;of $1.2 billion , or 24 percent . The increase &#32;in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2016 &#32;was primarily attributable to volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our attrition rate, which is favorable compared to the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our attrition rate. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $461.6 million , or seven percent &#32;of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $359.8 million , or seven percent &#32;of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase &#32;of $101.8 million , or 28 percent . \n\nRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1.8 billion , or 26 percent &#32;of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $1.5 billion , or 28 percent &#32;of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase &#32;of $251.2 million , or 17 percent . The increase &#32;in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2016 &#32;despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $170.5 million &#32;compared to fiscal 2015. We expect revenues outside of the Americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2017 by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar. \n\nCost of Revenues. &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\nDollars \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription and support \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,188,967 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n924,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n264,329 \n\nProfessional services and other \n\n&#160; \n\n465,581 \n\n&#160; \n\n364,632 \n\n&#160; \n\n100,949 \n\nTotal cost of revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,654,548 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,289,270 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n365,278 \n\nPercent of total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCost of revenues was $1.7 billion , or 25 percent &#32;of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $1.3 billion , or 24 percent &#32;of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase &#32;of $365.3 million . The increase &#32;in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $127.9 million &#32;in employee-related costs, an increase of $15.6 million &#32;in stock-based expenses, an increase of $137.2 million &#32;in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $40.6 million &#32;in professional and outside services, an increase in depreciation of equipment and an increase in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $9.4 million &#32;in amortization of purchased intangibles. We have increased our headcount by 34 percent &#32;since January 31, 2015 &#32;to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. \n\nThe cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2016 by $4.0 million as compared to $4.8 million during the same period a year ago. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. \n\nResearch and Development. &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\nDollars \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n946,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n792,917 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n153,383 \n\nPercent of total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and development expenses were $946.3 million , or 14 percent &#32;of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $792.9 million , or 15 percent &#32;of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase &#32;of $153.4 million .

We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. \n\nWe recorded a tax provision of $49.6 million &#32;with a pretax loss of $213.1 million , which resulted in an negative effective tax rate of 23 percent &#32;for fiscal 2015 . We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. \n\nWe regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome. We will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years. Due to our valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2015 and 2014 \n\nRevenues. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent \n\nSubscription and support \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,013,764 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,824,542 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,189,222 \n\n&#160; \n\n31% \n\nProfessional services and other \n\n&#160; \n\n359,822 \n\n&#160; \n\n246,461 \n\n&#160; \n\n113,361 \n\n&#160; \n\n46% \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,373,586 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,071,003 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,302,583 \n\n&#160; \n\n32% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTotal revenues were $5.4 billion &#32;for fiscal 2015 , compared to $4.1 billion &#32;during fiscal 2014 , an increase of $1.3 billion , or 32 percent .

The increase &#32;in subscription and support revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015 , including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014 , which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013 . Additionally, volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers contributed to the increase in subscription and support revenues. Our attrition rate, which was consistent with the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped maintain our attrition rate. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. Changes in the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, an increase of $113.4 million, or 46 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015, including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014, which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013. \n\nRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1.5 billion, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $1.2 billion, or 29 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2014, an increase of $334.1 million, or 29 percent. The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2015 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $31.5 million compared to fiscal 2014. \n\nCost of Revenues. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\nDollars \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription and support \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n924,638 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n711,880 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n212,758 \n\nProfessional services and other \n\n&#160; \n\n364,632 \n\n&#160; \n\n256,548 \n\n&#160; \n\n108,084 \n\nTotal cost of revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,289,270 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n968,428 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n320,842 \n\nPercent of total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCost of revenues was $1.3 billion, or 24 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $968.4 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2014, an increase of $320.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $122.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $100.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $29.9 million in professional and outside services, an increase of $18.8 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $44.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment, offset by a decrease of $19.1 million in amortization of purchased intangibles.

The decrease was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 0.75% convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015. These notes fully matured on January 15, 2015. \n\nGain on sales of land and building improvements. \n\nDuring fiscal 2015, we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate, including a portion of our perpetual parking rights, in San Francisco, California. We recognized a gain of $15.6 million during fiscal 2015, net of closing costs, as a result of this activity. \n\nOther expense. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nVariance \n\nDollars \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(19,878 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,868 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(15,010 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOther expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, costs associated with real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt.

We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. \n\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million &#32;for fiscal 2014. \n\nWe had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nAt January 31, 2016 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion &#32;and accounts receivable of $2.5 billion . \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion &#32;during fiscal 2016 &#32;and $1.2 billion &#32;during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities were affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on the conversions of convertible senior notes, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, the expense associated with stock-based awards, and specifically for fiscal 2016 gains related to the termination of 50 Fremont lease and the additional sales of our land in Mission Bay; and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. \n\nOur working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. \n\nAs described above in &#8220;Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,&#8221; our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. \n\nWe generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash \n\nflow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion &#32;during fiscal 2016 &#32;and $698.4 million &#32;during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 &#32;primarily related to capital expenditures, including strategic investments, business combinations, purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of Mission Bay land, the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 &#32;increased by approximately $789.5 million &#32;over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of 50 Fremont land and building and strategic investments. \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $132.6 million &#32;during fiscal 2016 &#32;as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $310.5 million &#32;during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 &#32;consisted primarily of $455.5 million &#32;from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million &#32;of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment &#32;of our revolving credit facility. Net cash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 changed $443.1 million &#32;from the same period a year ago primarily due to $568.9 million &#32;payment on convertible senior notes, $285.0 million &#32;payment on term loan, offset by $297.3 million &#32;proceeds from revolving credit facility and $309.0 million of proceeds from our equity plans. \n\nIn January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the &#8220;0.75% Senior Notes&#8221;) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the &#8220;0.75% Note Hedges&#8221;) and separate warrant transactions (the &#8220;0.75% Warrants&#8221;). On January 15, 2015, the 0.75% Senior Notes matured. Upon maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes, we delivered cash up to the remaining principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes. As a result of the conversions and maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its rights on the 0.75% Note Hedges, and the 0.75% Note Hedges expired. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.75% Warrant counterparties to amend and settle the 0.75% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in April 2015. As a result, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 13.3 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.75% Warrants. \n\nThe 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders&#8217; option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2016 . Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016 . Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders&#8217; option for the quarter ending January 31, 2016 . \n\nIn October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) that matures in October 2019. Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our Term Loan. In March 2015, we paid down the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings held under the Credit Facility and related interest in full. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. We may also prepay the borrowings under the Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. As of January 31, 2016 , outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $0. \n\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option at either a base rate formula or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears quarterly. \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreement&#8217;s covenants as of January 31, 2016 . \n\nIn August 2014, we sold approximately 3.7 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in San Francisco for a total of $72.5 million. Separately, in September 2014, we sold approximately 1.5 net acres of our undeveloped real estate for a total of $125.0 million. In October 2015, we sold approximately 8.8 net acres of undeveloped real estate and the associated perpetual parking \n\nrights in San Francisco, California, which were classified as held for sale. The total proceeds from the sale were $157.1 million, of which the Company received $127.1 million during fiscal 2016 and previously received a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of $30.0 million during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2014. \n\nIn February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (&#8220;50 Fremont&#8221;). We acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in San Francisco. See Note 4, &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $637.6 million. To pay for 50 Fremont, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash. \n\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, asset backed securities, mortgage backed securities obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. \n\nAs of January 31, 2016 , we have a total of $81.9 million &#32;in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. \n\nWe do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. \n\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2016 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Contractual Obligations \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than 1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1-3 Years \n\n&#160; \n\n3-5 Years \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than 5 Years \n\nCapital lease obligations, including interest \n\n$ \n\n558,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n118,820 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n238,048 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n201,543 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nOperating lease obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFacilities space \n\n1,986,694 \n\n&#160; \n\n191,879 \n\n&#160; \n\n404,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n391,944 \n\n&#160; \n\n998,849 \n\nComputer equipment and furniture and fixtures \n\n332,153 \n\n&#160; \n\n164,648 \n\n&#160; \n\n167,505 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest \n\n1,157,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,875 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,154,313 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancing obligation - building in progress - leased facility \n\n334,047 \n\n&#160; \n\n16,877 \n\n&#160; \n\n42,658 \n\n&#160; \n\n44,435 \n\n&#160; \n\n230,077 \n\nContractual commitments \n\n25,177 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,702 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,263 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,964 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,393,670 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n506,801 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,013,809 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n643,886 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,229,174 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2016 , $196.7 million &#32;of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation, building in progress - leased facility, which is included in &#8220;Other noncurrent liabilities&#8221; on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million &#32;over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases. \n\nIn February 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $311.0 million &#32;over the approximately 12 &#32;year term of the agreement, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. \n\nDuring fiscal 2016 &#32;and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and \n\nremain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. \n\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. \n\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn May 2014 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;), which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. The FASB deferred the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP for one year. In accordance with the deferral, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal 2019 , including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commission balances. \n\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, &#8220;Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805)&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2015-16&#8221;) which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-16 on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842)&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-02&#8221;), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures for Statement of Operations and Sharecount Information \n\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), &#8220;Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,&#8221; defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP free cash flow, and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We use the below non-GAAP financial measures to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. \n\nNon-GAAP net income \n\nWe define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the components described below, which we believe are not reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as we do, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and in better understanding the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStock-Based Expense. The Company&#8217;s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#8217;s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAmortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer&#8217;s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company&#8217;s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.53% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes was 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management&#8217;s assessment of the Company&#8217;s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of its core, ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company&#8217;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNon-Cash Gains/Losses on Conversion of Debt. Upon settlement of the Company&#8217;s convertible senior notes, we attribute the fair value of the consideration transferred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes. The difference between the fair value of consideration attributed to the liability component and the carrying value of the liability as of settlement date is recorded as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash gain/loss provides investors an enhanced view of the company&#8217;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGain on Sales of Land and Building Improvements. The Company views the non-operating gains associated with the sales of the land and building improvements at Mission Bay to be a discrete item. The difference between the cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the land and the building improvements as of the settlement date is recorded as a one-time gain on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Company&#8217;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLease Termination Resulting from Purchase of Office Building. &#32;The Company views the non-cash, one-time gain associated with the termination of its lease at 50 Fremont to be a discrete item. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Company&#8217;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncome Tax Effects and Adjustments. Since fiscal 2015, the Company has utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, amortization of debt discount, gains/losses on the sales of land and building improvements, gains/losses on conversions of debt, and termination of office leases. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the Company&#8217;s tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The Company re-evaluates this long-term rate on an annual basis and, as appropriate, if a significant event materially affects it. Our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax provision was 35.5 percent which reflected the related tax impact from the recent Tax Court decision in Altera Corporation&#8217;s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;). \n\n##TABLE_END 55 \n\nAdditionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, or as other events occur that are not related to the Company&#8217;s core, ongoing operating results, we may exclude the financial results of these events from non-GAAP net income in the period in which such events occur. For example, we could in the future recognize a significant gain or loss in connection with one or more of our strategic investments, which may not be viewed by management as reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. Similarly, the financial effects of significant facilities-related transactions may in the future be excluded from non-GAAP net income in the period in which such events may occur, if they are not viewed by management as reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. \n\nNon-GAAP gross profit \n\nWe define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. \n\nNon-GAAP operating profit \n\nWe define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and gain resulting from termination of our office lease that are included in operating expenses. \n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share \n\nManagement uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. \n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. \n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow \n\nWe define the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building in progress - leased facilities. \n\nLimitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures \n\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash flow is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. \n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\nOur reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

We computed and utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5 percent for fiscal 2015. We moved to this long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items. As a result, we believe that starting in fiscal 2015, providing a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of tax expense (benefit) to the comparable GAAP measure is not appropriate given our new methodology. \n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded for GAAP purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a partial valuation allowance release, primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. The increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the GAAP valuation allowance and the Company&#8217;s increasing acquisition activities. The following table for fiscal 2014 reflects the calculation of our non-GAAP tax expense: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, \n\nNon-GAAP tax expense (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGAAP tax benefit \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(125,760 \n\n) \n\nGAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments - tax effects of: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount, net (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n229,277 \n\nDeferred tax asset partial valuation release \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n25,048 \n\nState income tax credits not benefited (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,325 \n\nAcquisitions-related costs (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(19,708 \n\n) \n\nOther, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,787 \n\nTotal adjustments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n242,729 \n\nNon-GAAP tax expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n116,969 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The Company excluded stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and amortization of debt discount, net, in reporting its non-GAAP net income. Accordingly, the Company excluded the related tax effects of these items. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction. \n\n(2) During fiscal 2014, California mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state, which significantly reduced the Company&#8217;s California income tax expense. Accordingly, for computing non-GAAP tax expense, the Company did not \n\nrecognize tax benefits related to certain California research and development tax credits as the Company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered California income tax expense. \n\n(3) During fiscal 2014, the Company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its non-GAAP tax expense. The majority of this adjustment was attributable to non-cash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles. This non-cash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these non-cash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period, but were made for the Company&#8217;s long term benefit over multiple periods. The remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions, which amount was not material. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction. \n\n##TABLE_START "}
