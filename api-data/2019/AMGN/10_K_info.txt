analysis (MD&#38;A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen&#8217;s business. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&#38;A are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. \n\nForward-looking statements \n\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management&#8217;s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases, written statements or our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls.

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world&#8217;s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. In 2020, we celebrate our 40 th anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases. \n\nOur principal products&#8212;those with the most significant annual commercial sales&#8212;are ENBREL, Neulasta &#174; , Prolia &#174; , XGEVA &#174; , Aranesp &#174; , KYPROLIS &#174; , EPOGEN &#174; and our recently acquired product Otezla &#174; . We also market a number of other products, including Nplate &#174; , Vectibix &#174; , Repatha &#174; , Parsabiv &#174; , Sensipar &#174; /Mimpara &#174; , BLINCYTO &#174; , Aimovig &#174; , NEUPOGEN &#174; , KANJINTI TM , AMGEVITA TM , EVENITY &#174; , MVASI TM , IMLYGIC &#174; and Corlanor &#174; . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. \n\nOur strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, cardiovascular disease, nephrology and neuroscience and conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases. In 2019, we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched branded biosimilar programs, built our global geographic reach and expanded our next generation manufacturing capabilities, while returning capital to shareholders. \n\nDuring the year we delivered strong financial results while facing competition from biosimilars and generics. Total product sales decreased 1% as lower net selling prices were offset partially by volume growth. Product sales decreased 5% in the United States and grew 11% in the rest of the world. Total operating expenses increased 2% as we invested in our innovative R&#38;D pipeline, including our early oncology assets. \n\nWe continued to advance our pipeline, including AMG 510, which was granted fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation. We launched EVENITY &#174; in the United States and Japan, and it was granted marketing authorization in Europe; and the United States label for KYPROLIS &#174; was expanded. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launches of KANJINTI TM and MVASI TM in the United States and the approval of AVSOLA TM for all approved indications of the reference product REMICADE &#174; (infliximab) in the United States. Lastly, we made a regulatory submission for ABP 798 in the United States. \n\nWe have also continued to invest in external opportunities to augment our internal programs and products. We completed our acquisition of worldwide rights to Otezla &#174; , the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We strengthened our international footprint with the announcement of a strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China. In addition, we expanded our human genetics capabilities, by entering into a collaboration with a regional healthcare system in the United States and joining a consortium to perform whole genome sequencing of approximately 500,000 participants from the United Kingdom. Our human genetics capabilities allow us to identify new development targets in our chosen areas of therapeutic focus. \n\nCash flows from operating activities were $9.2 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2019, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock. In December 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2020. We also repurchased 40.2 million shares of our common stock throughout 2019 at an aggregate cost of $7.6 billion. \n\nOur long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&#38;D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and we also are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. \n\nRising healthcare costs and economic conditions also continue to pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. \n\nSee Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. \n\nSelected Financial Information \n\nThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nYear ended December 31, 2018 \n\nProduct sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n$ \n\n16,531 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,429 \n\nRest of world (ROW) \n\n5,673 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n5,104 \n\nTotal product sales \n\n22,204 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n22,533 \n\nOther revenues \n\n1,158 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n1,214 \n\nTotal revenues \n\n$ \n\n23,362 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,747 \n\nOperating expenses \n\n$ \n\n13,688 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,484 \n\nOperating income \n\n$ \n\n9,674 \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,263 \n\nNet income \n\n$ \n\n7,842 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,394 \n\nDiluted EPS \n\n$ \n\n12.88 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12.62 \n\nDiluted shares \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit demand growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held at wholesaler customers and end users such as pharmacies. \n\nTotal product sales decreased for 2019 , driven primarily by a decline in net selling price, offset partially by higher unit demand. For 2020, we expect net selling price to continue to decline. \n\nOther revenues decreased for 2019 , driven primarily by lower milestone payments, offset partially by higher royalties. \n\nOperating expenses increased for 2019 , driven primarily by higher spending in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by an impairment charge associated with an IPR&#38;D asset in 2018. \n\nAlthough changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros.

For 2020, we expect the trend of lower unit demand to continue. \n\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2018 was driven primarily by lower unit demand and net selling price. \n\nIn April 2019, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their FDA-approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. See Part IV&#8212;Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Companies with approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL may seek to enter the U.S. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier. \n\nNeulasta &#174; &#160; \n\nTotal Neulasta &#174; sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nYear ended December 31, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\n&#160; \n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 \n\nNeulasta &#174; &#160;&#8212; U.S. \n\n$ \n\n2,814 \n\n&#160; \n\n(27 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,866 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,931 \n\nNeulasta &#174; &#160;&#8212; ROW \n\n&#160; \n\n(33 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Neulasta &#174; \n\n$ \n\n3,221 \n\n&#160; \n\n(28 \n\n)% \n\n$ \n\n4,475 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,534 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in global Neulasta &#174; sales for 2019 was driven by the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling price and unit demand. Neulasta &#174; sales for 2019 included a $98 million order in the first quarter from the U.S. government. \n\nThe decrease in global Neulasta &#174; sales for 2018 was driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates of product returns in 2017, offset partially by favorable changes in inventory. Neulasta &#174; sales for 2018 included a $55 million order in the fourth quarter from the U.S. government. \n\nBiosimilar versions of Neulasta &#174; have been approved and launched, and other biosimilar versions may also receive approval in the near future. Therefore, we face increased competition in the United States and Europe, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of Neulasta &#174; .

, offset partially by lower royalties and lower manufacturing costs. \n\nCost of sales decreased to 17.3% of total revenues for 2018 , driven primarily by lower royalty costs, expenses related to Hurricane Maria in 2017 and lower acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by higher manufacturing costs. \n\nResearch and development \n\nThe Company groups all of its R&#38;D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products.

Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nR&#38;D expense by category was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and early pipeline \n\n$ \n\n1,649 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,201 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nLater-stage clinical programs \n\n1,062 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,034 \n\n&#160; \n\nMarketed products \n\n1,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,502 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,711 \n\nTotal R&#38;D expense \n\n$ \n\n4,116 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,737 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,562 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2019 was driven primarily by higher spend in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by lower marketed-product support. \n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2018 was driven by higher spend on our early pipeline and later-stage clinical programs as well as external business development expense in research and early pipeline, offset partially by lower marketed-product support. \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\nThe decrease in Selling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses for 2019 was driven primarily by lower general and administrative expenses, the end of certain amortization charges in 2018 and lower spend for launched and marketed products, offset partially by spending for Otezla &#174; commercial-related expenses. \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2018 was driven primarily by investments in product launches and marketed-product support. \n\nOther \n\nOther operating expenses for 2019 included $47 million in restructuring costs. \n\nOther operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an IPR&#38;D asset and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV&#8212;Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOther operating expenses for 2017 included $284 million of impairment-related charges associated with an intangible asset acquired in a business combination and $83 million of certain net charges related to a restructuring plan. \n\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes \n\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense, net \n\n$ \n\n1,289 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,392 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,304 \n\nInterest and other income, net \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n$ \n\n1,296 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,151 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,618 \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n14.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n12.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n79.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nInterest expense, net \n\nThe decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2019 was due primarily to a reduction in outstanding long-term debt as a result of maturities in the current year. \n\nThe increase in Interest expense, net, for 2018 was due primarily to the impact of rising interest rates on variable-rate debt. \n\nInterest and other income, net \n\nThe increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2019 was due primarily to net gains on sales of investments in interest-bearing securities liquidated to fund our acquisition of Otezla &#174; and our investment in BeiGene compared with losses in the prior year, offset partially by reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IV&#8212;Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 21, Subsequent events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2018 was due primarily to higher investment losses and lower interest income as a result of the liquidation of a portion of our portfolio, offset partially by gains on our equity investments and a net gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of K-A. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared with 2018 was due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. \n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2018 compared with 2017 was due primarily to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform. \n\nAs previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS&#8217;s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued. \n\nSee Summary of Critical Accounting Policies&#8212;Income taxes, and Part IV&#8212;Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n$ \n\n8,911 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,304 \n\nTotal assets \n\n$ \n\n59,707 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n66,416 \n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt \n\n$ \n\n2,953 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,419 \n\nLong-term debt \n\n$ \n\n26,950 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,510 \n\nStockholders&#8217; equity \n\n$ \n\n9,673 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,500 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\nWe have global access to our $8.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. \n\nCapital allocation \n\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we seek to deploy our accumulated cash balances in an efficient manner, and we consider several alternatives such as payment of dividends, stock repurchases, repayment of debt and strategic transactions that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest. \n\nWe intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company&#8217;s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. \n\nThe Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.15 per share of common stock paid in 2017 , increased our quarterly cash dividend by 15% to $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2018 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.45 per share of common stock paid in 2019 . In December 2019 , the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2020. \n\nWe also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2019 , we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion . In 2018 , we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion , which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In 2017, we repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.2 billion. In May 2019 and December 2019, \n\nour Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , $6.5 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. \n\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our accumulated deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position. \n\nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business . \n\nFinancing arrangements \n\nThe current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019 , were $ 3.0 billion and $ 27.0 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2018 , were $ 4.4 billion and $ 29.5 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC (S&#38;P), Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody&#8217;s), and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A- with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. \n\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2017 , we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion . During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , we repaid debt of $4.5 billion , $1.1 billion and $4.4 billion , respectively. \n\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $9.6 billion and $11.0 billion , respectively. \n\nTo hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion , respectively. \n\nAs of December 31, 2019 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2017, we issued and repaid an aggregate of $12.3 billion of commercial paper and had a maximum outstanding balance of $1.5 billion under our commercial paper program. During 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. \n\nIn 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions relating to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. \n\nIt is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2022. While various replacement reference rates have been discussed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted. Therefore, the mechanics to modify existing contracts that reference LIBOR have not been finalized. However, we do not expect that a change in the reference rate of our contracts will be material. See Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. \n\nIn February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023. \n\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which requires that we maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2019 . \n\nSee Part IV&#8212;Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCash flows \n\nOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n$ \n\n9,150 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,296 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,177 \n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities \n\n$ \n\n5,709 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,339 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4,024 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n$ \n\n(15,767 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(22,490 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(6,594 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating \n\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 due primarily to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the IRS related to an advance deposit and lower Net income. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2018 due primarily to improvements in working capital, offset partially by higher payments to tax authorities. \n\nInvesting \n\nCash provided by investing activities during 2019 and 2018 was due primarily to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion and $15.0 billion , respectively. The liquidation of portions of our marketable securities portfolio in 2019 was due primarily to fund the acquisition of Otezla &#174; and our investment in BeiGene and, in 2018, to fund the tender offer to repurchase our common stock. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 was due primarily to net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $3.2 billion . Capital expenditures were $618 million , $738 million and $664 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We currently estimate 2020 spending on capital projects to be approximately $700 million. \n\nFinancing \n\nCash used in financing activities during 2019 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $7.7 billion , repayments of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock of $17.8 billion , payments of dividends of $3.5 billion and repayments of debt of $1.1 billion . Cash used in financing activities during 2017 was due primarily to payments of dividends of $3.4 billion and repurchases of common stock of $3.2 billion , offset partially by proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, of $71 million . \n\nSee Part IV&#8212;Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 16, Stockholders&#8217; equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nContractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. \n\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments due by period as of December 31, 2019 \n\nContractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nYears 2 and 3 \n\n&#160; \n\nYears 4 and 5 \n\n&#160; \n\nYears 6 \n\nand beyond \n\nLong-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n48,080 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,086 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,612 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,467 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,915 \n\nOperating lease obligations &#160;(4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase obligations (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n1,938 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,512 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. repatriation tax (6) \n\n&#160; \n\n6,162 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,567 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,834 \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) (7) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n57,090 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,344 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,307 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,291 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n32,148 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nLong-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2019 , in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $309 million. See Part IV&#8212;Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nLong-term debt obligations include future interest payments on our LIBOR-based variable-rate obligations. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2019 , in computing the LIBOR-based portion of interest payments on these debt obligations. See Part IV&#8212;Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nLong-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayments of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively converted interest payments and principal repayments on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV&#8212;Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nOperating lease obligations includes payments for leases that have not yet commenced, net of lease incentives, and excludes $141 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) &#160; \n\nPurchase obligations relate primarily to (i) R&#38;D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) &#160; \n\nUnder the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. See Part IV&#8212;Note 19, Contingencies and commitments&#8212;Commitments &#8211; U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) &#160; \n\nLiabilities for UTBs are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV&#8212;Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.3 billion, including $325 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. Contingent \n\nconsideration with respect to the acquisition of Dezima Pharma B.V. was excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of AMG 899, upon which payments are based. See Part IV&#8212;Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nProduct sales and sales deductions \n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale. \n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nRebates \n\n&#160; \n\nChargebacks \n\n&#160; \n\nOther deductions \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2016 \n\n$ \n\n1,417 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,874 \n\nAmounts charged against product sales \n\n4,909 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,098 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11,999 \n\nPayments \n\n(4,459 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,168 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(999 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(11,626 \n\n) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2017 \n\n1,867 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,247 \n\nAmounts charged against product sales \n\n6,180 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,926 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,180 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,286 \n\nPayments \n\n(5,458 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,744 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,161 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,363 \n\n) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2018 \n\n2,589 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,170 \n\nAmounts charged against product sales \n\n6,825 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,090 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,207 \n\nPayments \n\n(6,249 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,985 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,263 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(14,497 \n\n) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 \n\n$ \n\n3,165 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,880 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , total sales deductions were 41% , 39% and 35% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 , was driven primarily by the impact of increases in U.S. rebates and to a lesser extent, higher chargebacks. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . \n\nIn the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. \n\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold. \n\nRebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements, which vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual \n\nsettlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. \n\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. \n\nProduct returns \n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. \n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. \n\nCertain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. \n\nWe are a vertically-integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct operations based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. \n\nAs previously disclosed, we received an RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In November 2017, we received a modified RAR that revised the IRS&#8217;s calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office, which currently has jurisdiction over the matter. If we deem necessary, we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater or less than amounts accrued. See Part IV&#8212;Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability . \n\nContingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV&#8212;Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. \n\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\nValuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions \n\nWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&#38;D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV&#8212;Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndetermining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprojecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nestimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndeveloping appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_END Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. \n\nWe believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and assets acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. \n\nImpairment of long-lived assets \n\nWe review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset&#8217;s fair value and its carrying value. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&#38;D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. \n\nEstimating future cash flows of an IPR&#38;D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&#38;D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&#38;D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&#38;D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards \n\nSee Part IV&#8212;Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2019 . \n\n##TABLE_START "}
