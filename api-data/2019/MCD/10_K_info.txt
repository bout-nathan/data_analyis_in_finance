"item_7_text": " MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS \n\nIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (\"ROIIC\"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as income tax provision adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"), and bases incentive compensation plans on these results, because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nComparable sales represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, since 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nComparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company&#8217;s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company&#8217;s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n2019 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\nIn 2019, global comparable sales increased 5.9% and global comparable guest counts increased 1.0% , reflecting the continued execution against the Velocity Growth Plan. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nComparable sales in the U.S. increased 5.0% and comparable guest counts decreased 1.9%. The increase in comparable sales reflected strong sales of our iconic core products driven by promotional activity and the continued positive impact from our Experience of the Future (\"EOTF\") deployment, as well as menu price increases. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nComparable sales in the International Operated segment increased 6.1% and comparable guest counts increased 3.5%, reflecting positive results across all markets, primarily driven by the U.K. and France. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nComparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment increased 7.2% and comparable guest counts increased 2.2%, reflecting positive sales performance across all geographic regions. \n\n##TABLE_END In addition to improved comparable sales and guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2019: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nConsolidated revenues were relatively flat with the prior year (increased 3% in constant currencies) at $21.1 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSystemwide sales increased 4% ( 7% in constant currencies) to $100.2 billion . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nConsolidated operating income increased 3% ( 6% in constant currencies). Excluding the impact of current year and prior year impairment and strategic charges, operating income increased 1% (4% in constant currencies). Refer to the Operating Income section on page 15 for additional details. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 42.0% in 2018 to 43.0% in 2019 . Excluding the items referenced in the previous bullet point, operating margin increased from 43.1% in 2018 to 43.4% in 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 6 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDiluted earnings per share of $7.88 increased 5% ( 7% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 10 for additional details. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCash provided by operations was $8.1 billion . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCapital expenditures of $2.4 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nFree cash flow was $5.7 billion, a 36% increase over the prior year. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAcross the System, about 1,200 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOne-year ROIIC was 22.8% and three-year ROIIC was 40.6% for the period ended December 31, 2019 . Excluding significant investing cash flows resulting from the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, three-year ROIIC was 24.6% (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $1.25 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.00 per share. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company returned $8.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year, marking successful achievement of the Company's targeted return of $25 billion for the three-year period ending 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END STRATEGIC DIRECTION \n\nThe strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald&#8217;s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities. \n\nCUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGY \n\nThe Velocity Growth Plan, the Company&#8217;s customer-centric strategy, is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Plan is designed to drive sustainable comparable sales and guest count growth, reliable long-term measures of the Company's strength that are vital to growing shareholder value. In 2019, execution of the Plan drove further broad-based growth around the globe. In 2020, the Company will continue to focus on elevating the customer experience through improved restaurant execution and creating excitement around our food and value offerings, while continuing to leverage technology to enable greater convenience and customer personalization. \n\nThe Company continues to target the opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonald&#8217;s: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRetaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRegaining customers who visit less often - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and speed, experience and value. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nConverting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCaf&#233; coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company continues to scale and optimize the Plan through the following growth accelerators: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nExperience of the Future . The Company is building upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance our brand in the eyes of our customers. The modernization efforts are designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits and higher average check. As of the end of 2019, EOTF is deployed in over half of the restaurants in our global system, with most of the major markets substantially complete. In 2019, the U.S. converted about 2,000 restaurants to EOTF, resulting in about 70% of the U.S. restaurants now having EOTF. In 2020, the Company will further deploy EOTF around the globe, including converting about 1,800 of the remaining restaurants in the U.S. to EOTF. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDigital . The Company is improving its existing service model with customers through technology. Digital technology is transforming the retail industry, and the Company is using it to transform McDonald&#8217;s for our customers at an accelerated pace. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served their food. The added functionality of the Company&#8217;s global mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other technologies enable greater convenience for the customer on their terms. In 2019, the Company built on its digital foundation, acquiring Dynamic Yield, a leader in personalization and decision logic technology. The Company has implemented this technology via outdoor digital menu boards in over 11,000 U.S. drive-thrus, offering customers a more customized experience and producing sales growth through higher average check. This technology is also deployed in nearly all drive-thrus in Australia, and we are looking to deploy across further international markets beginning in 2020. The Company continued to expand its technological capabilities via the acquisition of Apprente, an early-stage leader in conversational interface technology. This technology is expected to provide more efficient and accurate ordering in the drive-thru. In 2020, the Company will continue to utilize more personalized digital initiatives to engage customers, grow awareness and adoption of digital offerings, and support our menu offerings. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 7 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDelivery . The Company continues to build momentum with its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience for its customers. In 2019, McDonald&#8217;s continued to add third-party delivery partners in order to maximize the System&#8217;s delivery scale and potential. Across the global system, nearly 25,000 restaurants now offer delivery. Customers are responding positively, as demonstrated by high satisfaction ratings, strong reorder rates, and average checks that are generally two times higher than average non-delivery transactions. Further, in some of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. Consequently, McDonald&#8217;s global delivery business has grown to over $4 billion in Systemwide sales in 2019, up from $1 billion in 2016. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial of delivery, and are focusing on efforts to encourage frequency and retention in 2020 and beyond. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe Plan is a global strategy that is tailored at a market level to allow for the best customer experience and most convenience for our valued customers. While the Plan provides a consistent framework on how to retain, regain, and convert customers, the execution varies across the globe. The U.S., for example, remains centered on returning to guest count growth by focusing on running better restaurant operations, introducing new menu items and offering compelling value. In addition, we will continue transforming the customer experience through aggressive execution of the growth accelerators of EOTF, digital and delivery. In 2020, the markets around the world will continue to make progress on the three pillars of the Plan and its growth accelerators, focusing on food, value and customer convenience. \n\nOur Plan also includes the Company further embedding actions in response to certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business. As one of the world&#8217;s largest restaurant companies, our approach highlights our commitment to global actions that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. We recognize that our success in advancing these initiatives will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about visiting McDonald&#8217;s restaurants and eating our food. \n\nWhile we are working to address many challenges facing society today, we are elevating global action where we believe we can make the greatest difference in driving industry-wide change. Our priorities reflect the social and environmental impacts of our food and our business. Highlights include science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and climate action, advancing sustainable practices in beef production with suppliers and producers, driving innovative solutions for our packaging and recycling efforts, and ongoing commitments to support families and provide opportunities for youth in our communities. In 2019, for example, we made progress toward our 2030 climate action target with the addition of significant investments in renewable energy projects in the U.S.; we achieved our goal of 100% sustainably sourced McCaf&#233; coffee for U.S. restaurants; and we continued to make a difference for families through innovation in our food offerings, reading programs and support for Ronald McDonald House Charities. \n\nThe Company is confident, that under the Plan, we will continue to improve the taste of our delicious food, enhance convenience and service through running great restaurants, offer compelling value, and heighten the trust consumers place in our brand, which we believe will enable us to deliver long-term sustainable growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 8 \n\nOUTLOOK \n\n2020 Outlook \n\nThe following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company&#8217;s future results. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nChanges in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2020 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects full year 2020 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase about 5% to 7% in constant currencies as the Company invests in technology and research &#38; development, and incurs costs related to the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, which will occur in the second quarter 2020. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nBased on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2020 to increase about 4% to 6% due primarily to higher average debt balances. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 80% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 35 cents. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2020 to be in the 23% to 25% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe Company expects capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About $1.3 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, over half of which is allocated to approximately 1,800 EOTF projects. Globally, we expect to open roughly 1,400 restaurants. We will spend approximately $800 million in the U.S. and International Operated segments to open 400 restaurants and our developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards the remaining 1,000 restaurant openings in the International Developmental Licensed segment.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.21 on diluted earnings per share. \n\nIn 2018, net income increased 14% (13% in constant currencies) to $5.9 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 18% (18% in constant currencies) to $7.54. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.04 on diluted earnings per share. \n\nResults in 2019 reflected stronger operating performance primarily due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses (mostly in the U.S.) and higher G&#38;A spend. Results in 2018 reflected a lower effective tax rate, and stronger operating performance due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars due to the impact of refranchising. \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 10 \n\nOutlined below is additional information for the full year 2019, 2018, and 2017: \n\n##TABLE_START Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Reconciliation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) \n\nexcluding currency \n\ntranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGAAP earnings per share-diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.88 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.54 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6.37 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nIncome tax (benefit) cost, net \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.11 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n0.10 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.82 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStrategic charges \n\n&#160; \n\n0.07 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.26 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share-diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.84 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.90 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6.66 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIncluded in the 2019 results were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\n$84 million, or $0.11 per share, of income tax benefit due to new regulations issued in the fourth quarter 2019 related to the Tax Act; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\n$74 million of pre-tax strategic charges, or $0.07 per share, primarily related to impairment associated with the purchase of our joint venture partner's interest in the India Delhi market, partly offset by gains on the sales of property at the former Corporate headquarters. \n\n##TABLE_END Included in the 2018 results were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\n$75 million, or $0.10 per share, of net tax cost associated with the final 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in December 2017 under the Tax Act; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\n$140 million of pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges, or $0.17 per share; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\n$94 million of pre-tax strategic restructuring charges, or $0.09 per share. \n\n##TABLE_END Included in the 2017 results were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\n$700 million of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, or $0.82 per share; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; \n\na pre-tax gain of $850 million on the sale of the Company&#8217;s businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the Company&#8217;s global G&#38;A and refranchising initiatives, for a net benefit of $0.53 per share. \n\n##TABLE_END Excluding the above 2019 and 2018 items, 2019 net income decreased 3% (1% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share decreased 1% (increased 2% in constant currencies). Excluding items impacting 2018 and 2017, 2018 net income increased 14% (14% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share increased 19% (18% in constant currencies). \n\nThe Company repurchased 25.0 million shares of its stock for $5.0 billion in 2019 and 32.2 million shares of its stock for $5.2 billion in 2018 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. \n\nREVENUES \n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Initial fees are recognized evenly over the franchise term. \n\nFranchised restaurants represent 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2019. The Company's current mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants enables the Company to generate stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams. Refranchising to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants may negatively impact consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised revenues, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percent of sales. \n\nIn 2019, revenues were relatively flat with the prior year (increased 3% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase was primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. In 2018, revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies), reflecting the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, partly offset by positive comparable sales. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 11 \n\n##TABLE_START Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) \n\nexcluding currency \n\ntranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDollars in millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany-operated sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,490 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,665 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,260 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(18 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(18 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Operated Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n6,334 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,668 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,845 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,614 \n\n&#160; \n\n(12 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(74 \n\n) \n\n* \n\n(7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(75 \n\n) \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,013 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,719 \n\n&#160; \n\n(6 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(21 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n(22 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\nFranchised revenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,353 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,001 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,746 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Operated Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n5,064 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,839 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,271 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n1,239 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,172 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,084 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,656 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,012 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,101 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,843 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,666 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,006 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Operated Markets \n\n&#160; \n\n11,398 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,507 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,116 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\n1,836 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,852 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,698 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(50 \n\n) \n\n* \n\n&#160; \n\n(50 \n\n) \n\n* \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,077 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,025 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,820 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n%) \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n* Reflects the impact of refranchising the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong in 2017. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nU.S.: Revenues in 2019 and 2018 reflected positive comparable sales.

Excluding the income tax benefit, the effective income tax rate was 25.9% for the year 2019. \n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected the final 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the Tax Act of $75 million net tax cost. Excluding the 2018 impact of the Tax Act and impairment charges, the effective income tax rate was 22.9% for the year 2018. \n\nExcluding these current year and prior year items, the lower effective income tax rate for 2018 primarily reflected a benefit from a change in tax reserves as a result of global audit progression, as well as lower tax costs in 2018 related to ongoing taxes under the Tax Act. \n\nConsolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $5.3 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018 . Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nRecently issued accounting standards are included on page 39 of this Form 10-K. \n\nCASH FLOWS \n\nThe Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\nCash provided by operations totaled $8.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.1 billion or 17%. Free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.5 billion or 36%. The Company&#8217;s free cash flow conversion rate was 95% in 2019 and 71% in 2018 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). Cash provided by operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and lower income tax payments. In 2018, cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion or 25% compared with 2017, primarily due to lower tax payments. \n\nCash used for investing activities totaled $3.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $616 million compared with 2018. The increase was primarily due to the Company&#8217;s strategic acquisitions of a real estate entity, Dynamic Yield and Apprente, partly offset by lower capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.0 billion compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of restaurant businesses in 2018 including the comparison to the proceeds received in 2017 associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as higher capital expenditures. \n\nCash used for financing activities totaled $5.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of $955 million compared with 2018, primarily due to net debt activity. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $639 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash and equivalents balance was $899 million and $866 million at year end 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. \n\nRESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n\nIn 2019 , the Company opened 1,231 restaurants and closed 391 restaurants.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, as well as leveraging the Company's global sourcing network and best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional McDonald&#8217;s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $4.0 million in 2019 . \n\nThe Company owned approximately 55% and 50% of the land for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2019 and 2018. \n\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS \n\nIn 2019, the Company returned approximately $8.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, marking the achievement of the Company's targeted return of $25 billion for the three-year period ended 2019. \n\nShares repurchased and dividends &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of shares repurchased \n\n25.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n32.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n31.4 \n\nShares outstanding at year end \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDividends declared per share \n\n$ \n\n4.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.19 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.83 \n\nTreasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity) \n\n$ \n\n4,980 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,247 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,651 \n\nDividends paid \n\n3,582 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,089 \n\nTotal returned to shareholders \n\n$ \n\n8,562 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,503 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,740 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date. In 2019, approximately 25.0 million shares were repurchased for $5.0 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to approximately 74.5 million shares or $12.9 billion. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2017 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2020, that authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. \n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 44 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2019 full year dividend of $4.73 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.16 per share, with an increase to $1.25 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 8% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $5.00 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company&#8217;s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\nFINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nTOTAL ASSETS \n\nTotal assets increased $14.7 billion or 45% in 2019 , primarily due to the addition of the Lease Right-of-Use Asset, Net, which was recorded upon adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019. Refer to the Lease Accounting section under Recent Accounting Pronouncements on page 39 for additional information on ASC 842. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion in 2019, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Net property and equipment and the Lease Right-of-Use Asset, Net represented over 50% and approximately 30%, respectively, of total assets at year-end. Approximately 93% of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2019. \n\nFINANCING AND MARKET RISK \n\nThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2019 totaled $34.2 billion, compared with $31.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The net increase in 2019 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.5 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 17 \n\nDebt highlights (1) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed-rate debt as a percent of total debt (2,3) \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nWeighted-average annual interest rate of total debt (3) \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\nForeign currency-denominated debt as a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total Shareholders' equity) (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations as a percent of total debt (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nAll percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company&#8217;s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#8217;s business. In October 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the borrowing of up to $15.0 billion of funds, of which $1.9 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2016 borrowing authority and authorized a new $15 billion of borrowing capacity with no specified expiration date. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $3.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). In 2020, the Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance $2.4 billion of maturing corporate debt. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's subsidiaries also had $242 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements. \n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. \n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders&#8217; equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.9 billion and $11.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company&#8217;s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. \n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2019 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company&#8217;s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company&#8217;s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: \n\nForeign currency net asset exposures \n\n##TABLE_START In millions of U.S. Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nBritish Pounds Sterling \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,840 \n\nCanadian Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\nRussian Ruble \n\n&#160; \n\nAustralian Dollars \n\n&#160; \n\n1,499 \n\nPolish Zloty \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 18 \n\nThe Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company&#8217;s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2019 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2019 levels would materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. \n\nLIQUIDITY \n\nThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn approximately 65% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. \n\nThe Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $425 million as of December 31, 2019 . \n\nConsistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, issuance of domestic debt, and repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing and financing activities. \n\nIn the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Minimum rent under franchise arrangements are based on the Company&#8217;s underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Company&#8217;s underlying lease obligations and escalations on properties that are leased. The Company believes that control over the real estate enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are amongst the highest in the industry. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company&#8217;s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2019 . \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nContractual cash outflows \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual cash inflows \n\n&#160; \n\nIn millions \n\nOperating leases (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDebt obligations (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMinimum rent under \n\nfranchise arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,147 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,008 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,096 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,132 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,884 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,014 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,250 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6,007 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,631 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,819 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,541 \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n7,090 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21,038 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n20,510 \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,134 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,305 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,324 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nFor sites that have lease escalations tied to an index, future minimum payments reflect the current index adjustments through December 31, 2019. In addition, future minimum payments exclude option periods that have not yet been exercised. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nThe maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $3.5 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2023. Debt obligations do not include the impact of non-cash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs and accrued interest. \n\n##TABLE_END In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") limitations. At December 31, 2019 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $435 million . \n\nAt December 31, 2019, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.4 billion . \n\nThere are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Company&#8217;s overall financial position. \n\nThe Company also has guaranteed certain other loans totaling approximately $75 million at December 31, 2019. These guarantees are contingent commitments generally issued by the Company to support borrowing arrangements of the System. At December 31, 2019, there was no carrying value for obligations under these guarantees in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 19 \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nManagement&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\nThe Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProperty and equipment \n\n##TABLE_END Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management&#8217;s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLeasing Arrangements \n\n##TABLE_END The Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability reflect the present value of the Company&#8217;s estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. \n\nTypically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company. \n\nAs the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nShare-based compensation \n\n##TABLE_END The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period. \n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLong-lived assets impairment review \n\n##TABLE_END Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company&#8217;s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company&#8217;s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual market) with risk of material goodwill impairment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLitigation accruals \n\n##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in a particular matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 20 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncome taxes \n\n##TABLE_END The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. \n\nThe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. The most significant new developments in 2019 and 2018 are described below. \n\nIn 2019 and 2018, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by $96 million and $162 million, respectively. In both 2019 and 2018, there was audit progression in the U.S. federal and state audits, as well as multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company has considered this new information in evaluating the unrecognized tax benefits and in certain situations, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits. These changes have been reflected in the Unrecognized Tax Benefits table that is included in the Income Taxes footnote on page 50. \n\nIn 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) issued a Revenue Agent Report (&#8220;RAR&#8221;) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December 2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and during 2019, the Company and the IRS Appeals team continued to have a dialogue regarding these disagreed transfer pricing matters. As of December 31, 2019, the Company does not yet have a signed closing agreement with the IRS related to the settlement of these issues. The Company expects resolution on these issues in 2020. \n\nIn 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company&#8217;s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process, such that resolution is expected in 2020. \n\nWhile the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the ASC. \n\nThe Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") 118. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. \n\nSAB 118 measurement period \n\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes , primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. \n\nOne-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\"E&#38;P\"), the tax on which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability for each of its foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a transition tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. \n\nUpon further analysis of the Tax Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Company finalized its calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018 and increased its December 31, 2017 provisional amount by approximately $75 million. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of approximately $500 million. No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018. \n\nEFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES&#8212;INFLATION \n\nThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. \n\n&#160;

Franchised restaurants represent 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 22 \n\nSTOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH \n\nAt least annually, we consider which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group. McDonald's is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of our size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, we believe that such a comparison is not meaningful. \n\nOur market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, we believe that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate. \n\nThe following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 Stock Index (S&#38;P 500 Index) and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2019 . The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the S&#38;P 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2014 . For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization, and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration. \n\n##TABLE_START Company/Index \n\n12/31/2014 \n\n12/31/2015 \n\n12/31/2016 \n\n12/31/2017 \n\n12/31/2018 \n\n12/31/2019 \n\nMcDonald's Corporation \n\n$100 \n\n$130 \n\n$139 \n\n$201 \n\n$213 \n\n$242 \n\nS&#38;P 500 Index \n\n$100 \n\n$101 \n\n$114 \n\n$138 \n\n$132 \n\n$174 \n\nDow Jones Industrials \n\n$100 \n\n$100 \n\n$117 \n\n$150 \n\n$144 \n\n$181 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSource: S&#38;P Capital IQ \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 23 \n\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nMARKET INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND POLICY \n\nThe Company&#8217;s common stock trades under the symbol MCD and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. \n\nThe number of shareholders of record and beneficial owners of the Company&#8217;s common stock as of January 31, 2020 was estimated to be 2,500,000 . \n\nGiven the Company&#8217;s returns on incremental invested capital and significant cash provided by operations, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 44 consecutive years through 2019 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nThe following table presents information related to repurchases of common stock the Company made during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 *: \n\n##TABLE_START Period \n\nTotal Number of \n\nShares Purchased \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage Price \n\nPaid per Share \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Number of \n\nShares Purchased as \n\nPart of Publicly \n\nAnnounced Plans or \n\nPrograms (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nApproximate Dollar \n\nValue of Shares \n\nthat May Yet \n\nBe Purchased Under \n\nthe Plans or Programs (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1-31, 2019 \n\n2,393,580 \n\n&#160; \n\n208.93 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,393,580 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,943,051,009 \n\nNovember 1-30, 2019 \n\n2,886,335 \n\n&#160; \n\n193.60 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,886,335 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,384,270,449 \n\nDecember 1-31, 2019 \n\n1,787,824 \n\n&#160; \n\n195.90 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,787,824 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,034,034,984 \n\nTotal \n\n7,067,739 \n\n&#160; \n\n199.37 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,067,739 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * \n\nSubject to applicable law, the Company may repurchase shares directly in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to derivative instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1, among other types of transactions and arrangements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) \n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, effective July 28, 2017 (\"2017 Program\"), that authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. On December 6, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2017 Program, effective December 31, 2019, and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2020 (\"2020 Program\"), that authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, no further share repurchases may be made under the 2017 Program; future share repurchases will be made pursuant to the 2020 program. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 24 \n\nRISK FACTORS \n\nIf we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including under the Velocity Growth Plan, we may not be able to increase operating income. \n\nTo drive operating income growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal, delivering sustainable guest count growth and driving a higher average check. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System&#8217;s ability to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nContinue to innovate and differentiate the McDonald&#8217;s experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCapitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to enhance our ability to retain, regain and convert key customer groups; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUtilize our organizational structure to build on our progress and execute against our business strategies; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIntegrate and augment our technology and digital initiatives, including mobile ordering and delivery; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIdentify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperate restaurants with high service levels and optimal capacity while managing the increasing complexity of our restaurant operations, create efficiencies through innovative use of technology and complete Experience of the Future (&#8220;EOTF&#8221;), particularly in the U.S.; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAccelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities, acquisitions, investments and partnerships. \n\n##TABLE_END If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. \n\nOur investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns. \n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, including in EOTF (which focuses on restaurant modernization), digital engagement and delivery, in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, as well as mobile ordering and payment systems. We also continue to refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial, and to enhance our drive-thru technologies, which may not generate expected returns. If these initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer. \n\nIf we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer. \n\nOur continued success depends on our System&#8217;s ability to retain, regain and convert customers. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings and consumer preferences in the &#8220;informal eating out&#8221; (&#8220;IEO&#8221;) segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted. \n\nOur ability to retain, regain and convert customers also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, and could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share. \n\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently. If the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 25 \n\nFailure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results. \n\nTo be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and our general business practices. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand, our operations, our suppliers, or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and our financial results may suffer. \n\nAdditionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require Systemwide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage any risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include any increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. \n\nIf we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In particular, business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. \n\nWe face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business. \n\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions or product offerings of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results. \n\nWe compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors&#8217; actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. \n\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results. \n\nOur results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer. \n\nOur results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely affect reported earnings. \n\nSupply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues. \n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our System&#8217;s supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our System&#8217;s operations. \n\nFood safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nOur ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System&#8217;s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald&#8217;s of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 26 \n\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks. \n\nThe Company's success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us. \n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company or by banks&#8217; lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand&#8217;s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. \n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives. \n\nChallenges with respect to talent management could harm our business. \n\nEffective succession planning is important to our long-term success. The Board named Christopher Kempczinski as President and Chief Executive Officer and named Joseph Erlinger as President, McDonald's USA, effective as of November 1, 2019. In addition, on December 6, 2019, the Board named Ian Borden as President, International, effective that same day. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions, including the recent leadership transitions, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results. \n\nChallenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could impact our business and results of operations. \n\nOur success depends in part on our System&#8217;s ability to proactively recruit, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in McDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. In many of our markets, unemployment is low and demand is high for labor. Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants, as well as costs to promote awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald's restaurants, could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins. Similar concerns apply to our franchisees. \n\nWe are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of sexual harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results. \n\nInformation technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm. \n\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, technologies supporting McDonald&#8217;s digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our franchisees&#8217; operations, or our customers&#8217; experience and perceptions. Additionally, we provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaffiliated with the McDonald&#8217;s System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaffiliated parties, which may result in liability to the Company or reputational harm. \n\nDespite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party&#8217;s business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees&#8217; operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 27 \n\nFurthermore, security incidents or breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, our employees, our franchisees, our business customers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal, financial, proprietary or other confidential information. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities. \n\nIf we fail to comply with privacy and data collection laws, we could be subject to penalties, which could negatively affect our financial results or brand perceptions. \n\nWe are subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to business partners, customers, employees, franchisees or other third parties. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the European Union to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of that data. We are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area. These regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be markets or jurisdictions that propose or enact new or emerging data privacy requirements in the future. Failure to meet GDPR or other data privacy requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results or brand perceptions. \n\nThe global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business. \n\nWe encounter differing cultural, regulatory, geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald&#8217;s restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System&#8217;s ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts. \n\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees&#8217; or our suppliers&#8217; operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions. \n\nAdditionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n\nWe may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, as a result of the U.K.&#8217;s decision to leave the European Union, whether through a negotiated exit over a period of time or without any agreement in place to govern post-exit relations, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, particularly in the event that the U.K. leaves the European Union without any agreement in place, as well as potential additional referenda in the U.K. and/or other European countries, that could cause uncertainty in European or worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nIf we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted. \n\nWe have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital and delivery, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability. \n\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations; insurance; zoning, tax and eminent domain laws; interest rate levels and the cost of financing. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 28 \n\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability. \n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. \n\nChanges in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nThe profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel, utilities and distribution, and other operating costs, including labor. Any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. \n\nIncreasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results. \n\nOur regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, product packaging, marketing, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of regulations that can affect our business plans and operations, and have increased our costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings. \n\nWe are also subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations and proceedings, shareholder proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, supplier related disputes, and claims by current or former franchisees. Regardless of whether claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management's attention away from operations. \n\nLitigation and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. \n\nOur results could also be affected by the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAdverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices. \n\n##TABLE_END A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory and legal environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald&#8217;s brand and our business. \n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. \n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. \n\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 29 \n\nChanges in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results. \n\nNew accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods. \n\nA decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability. \n\nOur credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. \n\nOur operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n\nTrading volatility and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors. \n\nMany factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGovernmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic, trade or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nTrading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald&#8217;s may be included, such as the S&#38;P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies, including through acquisitions, in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure. \n\n##TABLE_END Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects. \n\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, any shifting climate patterns, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. For example, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China has disrupted local operations, and neither the duration nor scope of the disruption can be predicted. Therefore, while we expect this matter to negatively impact our results, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 30 \n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\nThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company&#8217;s entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nFranchising \n\n##TABLE_END A substantial number of McDonald&#8217;s restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators and developmental licensees under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee claims for additional franchises or renewals of franchises. Additionally, occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a McDonald&#8217;s franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nSuppliers \n\n##TABLE_END The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald&#8217;s restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company&#8217;s high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company&#8217;s business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company&#8217;s restaurants. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nEmployees \n\n##TABLE_END Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCustomers \n\n##TABLE_END Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public as do independent owner/operators and developmental licensees of McDonald's restaurants. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, pricing, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nIntellectual Property \n\n##TABLE_END The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the Company&#8217;s business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third party intellectual property. &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nGovernment Regulations \n\n##TABLE_END Local and national governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation. The Company is occasionally involved in litigation or other proceedings regarding these matters. The Company strives to comply with all applicable existing statutory and administrative rules and cannot predict the effect on its operations from these matters or the issuance of additional requirements in the future. \n\nPROPERTIES \n\nThe Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the System. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Company&#8217;s experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which facilitates long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Company&#8217;s global sourcing network. \n\nIn addition, the Company primarily leases real estate in connection with its corporate headquarters, field and other offices. \n\nAdditional information about the Company&#8217;s properties is included in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 6 through 21 and in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data on pages 33 through 58 of this Form 10-K. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 31 \n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n\nThe following are the Executive Officers of our Company (as of the date of this filing): \n\nIan Borden , 51, is President, International, a position he has held since January 2020.

\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS \n\nThe Company franchises and operates McDonald&#8217;s restaurants in the global restaurant industry. All restaurants are operated either by the Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchised arrangements, and developmental licensees or affiliates under license agreements. \n\nThe following table presents restaurant information by ownership type: \n\n##TABLE_START Restaurants at December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConventional franchised \n\n21,837 \n\n&#160; \n\n21,685 \n\n&#160; \n\n21,366 \n\nDevelopmental licensed \n\n7,648 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,225 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,945 \n\nForeign affiliated \n\n6,574 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,175 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,797 \n\nTotal Franchised \n\n36,059 \n\n&#160; \n\n35,085 \n\n&#160; \n\n34,108 \n\nCompany-operated \n\n2,636 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,770 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,133 \n\nTotal Systemwide restaurants \n\n38,695 \n\n&#160; \n\n37,855 \n\n&#160; \n\n37,241 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. \n\nCONSOLIDATION \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald&#8217;s China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method. \n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. \n\nESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION \n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nLease Accounting \n\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 842, \"Leases\" (\"ASC 842\") as of January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method. As discussed further in the &#8220;Franchise Arrangements&#8221; and &#8220;Leasing Arrangements&#8221; footnotes, the Company is engaged in a significant amount of leasing activity, both from a lessor and a lessee perspective. \n\nThe Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company to retain the classification of existing leases; therefore, there was minimal initial impact in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and no cumulative adjustment to retained earnings was recognized upon adoption. As the Company enters into new ground leases or as existing ground leases are modified, many of these may be reclassified from operating classification to financing classification, which will change the timing and classification of a portion of lease expense between Operating income and Interest expense. It is not possible to quantify the impact at this time, due to the unknown timing of new leases and lease modifications, however the Company does not expect the impact to be material to any given year. The Company has also made an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off of the balance sheet. These types of leases primarily relate to leases of office equipment, and are not significant in comparison to the Company&#8217;s overall lease portfolio. Payments related to those leases will continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nThe Company has certain leases subject to index adjustments. Historically, the Company has calculated and disclosed future minimum payments for these leases using the index as of the end of the reporting period. As part of the transition, the Company used the index in effect at transition for adoption of ASC 842 in its disclosure of future minimum lease payments and its calculation of the lease liability. For leases entered into after January 1, 2019, the index at lease inception date will be used to calculate the lease liability until lease modification. \n\nThe Company recorded a Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of $12.5 billion upon adoption. The Lease Liability reflects the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. The impact of the new lease guidance is non-cash in nature, therefore, it does not affect the Company&#8217;s cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 39 \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses \n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\", that modifies the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on financial assets. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2020, prospectively. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION \n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. \n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term, and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. The Company's accounting policy through December 31, 2017, was to recognize initial franchise fees when received, upon a new restaurant opening and at the start of a new franchise term. Beginning in January 2018, initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years. \n\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT \n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings&#8211;up to 40 years; leasehold improvements&#8211; the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which generally include certain option periods; and equipment&#8211; 3 to 12 years. \n\nCAPITALIZED SOFTWARE \n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 2 to 7 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2019 - $ 665.4 ; 2018 - $ 609.7 ; 2017 - $ 535.6 . \n\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS \n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald&#8217;s restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant&#8217;s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. \n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered &#8220;available for sale.\" \n\nGOODWILL \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. \n\nThe following table presents the 2019 activity in goodwill by segment: ##TABLE_START In millions \n\nU.S. \n\nInternational \n\nOperated Markets \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets &#38; Corporate \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2018 \n\n$ \n\n1,276.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,055.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,331.5 \n\nBusiness acquisitions \n\n348.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n348.8 \n\nNet restaurant purchases (sales) \n\n( 9.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n5.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n99.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n95.6 \n\nImpairment losses \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 99.4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 99.4 \n\n) \n\nCurrency translation \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\nBalance at December 31, 2019 \n\n$ \n\n1,615.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,061.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,677.4 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 40 \n\nThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects accumulated impairment losses of $ 113.9 million and $ 15.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \n\nADVERTISING COSTS \n\nAdvertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2019 &#8211; $ 365.8 ; 2018 &#8211; $ 388.8 ; 2017 &#8211; $ 532.9 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related expenses are included in Selling, general &#38; administrative expenses and were (in millions): 2019 &#8211; $ 81.5 ; 2018 &#8211; $ 88.0 ; 2017 &#8211; $ 100.2 . Costs related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in the expenses for 2018. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. The costs incurred by these advertising cooperatives are approved and managed jointly by vote of both Company-operated restaurants and franchisees. \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nIncome Tax Uncertainties \n\nThe Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in management&#8217;s judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management&#8217;s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. \n\nThe Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. \n\nAccounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") \n\nThe Tax Act requires a U.S. shareholder of a foreign corporation to include GILTI in taxable income. The accounting policy of the Company is to record any tax on GILTI in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred. &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 41 \n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. \n\nThe valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLevel 1 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLevel 2 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nLevel 3 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. \n\n##TABLE_END Certain of the Company&#8217;s derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the Company. &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCertain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value \n\n##TABLE_END The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance: ##TABLE_START 12/31/2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIn millions \n\nLevel 1 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nDerivative assets \n\n$ \n\n179.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n45.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n224.7 \n\nDerivative liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 11.3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 11.3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/31/2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIn millions \n\nLevel 1 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nLevel 2 \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nDerivative assets \n\n$ \n\n167.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n39.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n206.3 \n\nDerivative liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 16.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 16.6 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nLevel 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Company&#8217;s supplemental benefit plans. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nNon-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \n\n##TABLE_END Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded fair value adjustments to its long-lived assets, primarily to goodwill, based on Level 3 inputs which includes the use of a discounted cash flow valuation approach. \n\n##TABLE_START &#9642; \n\nCertain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value \n\n##TABLE_END At December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Company&#8217;s debt obligations was estimated at $37.6 billion , compared to a carrying amount of $34.2 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying amount for both cash equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. \n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES \n\nThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. \n\nThe Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Company&#8217;s derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross-currency interest rate swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the \"Fair Value,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections. \n\nThe Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the &#8220;Undesignated Derivatives&#8221; section. \n\nAll derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments&#8217; maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to AOCI and/or current earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 42 \n\nThe following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 : ##TABLE_START &#160;

The Company enters into fair value hedges that convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2019 , the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was effectively converted was an equivalent notional amount of $ 998.5 million , which included an increase of $ 12.1 million of cumulative hedging adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recognized a $ 24.0 million gain on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding loss on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to interest expense. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. The hedges cover the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $ 754.7 million that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows. \n\nBased on market conditions at December 31, 2019 , the $ 12.0 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 43 \n\nNet Investment Hedges \n\nThe Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2019 , $ 11.9 billion of the Company's third party foreign currency denominated debt and $ 642.6 million of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. \n\nUndesignated Derivatives \n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in selling, general &#38; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. \n\nCredit Risk \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2019 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2019 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company&#8217;s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. \n\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nShare-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value. \n\nShare-based compensation expense and the effect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions, except per share data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShare-based compensation expense \n\n$ \n\n109.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n125.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n117.5 \n\nAfter tax \n\n$ \n\n94.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n108.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n82.0 \n\nEarnings per common share-diluted \n\n$ \n\n0.12 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.14 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.10 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCompensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &#38; administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2019, there was $ 107.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. \n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2019 , 2018 and 2017 stock option grants. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company&#8217;s most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life. \n\nWeighted-average assumptions \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n2018 \n\nExpected dividend yield \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n2.6 \n\n% \n\n3.1 \n\n% \n\nExpected stock price volatility \n\n18.9 \n\n% \n\n18.7 \n\n% \n\n18.4 \n\n% \n\nRisk-free interest rate \n\n2.5 \n\n% \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n2.2 \n\n% \n\nExpected life of options (in years) \n\n5.8 \n\n5.8 \n\n5.9 \n\nFair value per option granted \n\n$ \n\n25.60 \n\n$ \n\n23.80 \n\n$ \n\n16.10 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 44 \n\nPER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION \n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2019 &#8211; 6.8 ; 2018 &#8211; 7.3 ; 2017 &#8211; 8.1 . Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2019 &#8211; 0.1 ; 2018 &#8211; 0.5 ; 2017 &#8211; 0.1 . \n\nCASH AND EQUIVALENTS \n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. \n\n##TABLE_START Segment and Geographic Information \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Company provided investors with segment summary financial information and other data in accordance with its new organizational structure for the previously reported years ended December 31, 2016 through 2018.

Minimum rent payments are based on the Company's underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Company&#8217;s underlying leases and escalations on properties that are leased. Under the franchise arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonald&#8217;s System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. At the end of the 20-year franchise arrangement, the Company maintains control of the underlying real estate and building and can either enter into a new 20-year franchise arrangement with the existing franchisee or a different franchisee, or close the restaurant. Franchisees generally pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance. \n\nDevelopmental licensees and affiliates operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of sales, and generally pay initial fees. \n\nMcDonald&#8217;s has elected to allocate consideration in the franchise contract among lease and non-lease components in the same manner that it has historically: rental income (lease), royalty income (non-lease) and initial fee income (non-lease). This disaggregation and presentation of revenue is based on the nature, amount, timing and certainty of the revenue and cash flows. The allocation has been determined based on a mix of both observable and estimated standalone selling prices (the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer). \n\nRevenues from franchised restaurants consisted of: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRents \n\n$ \n\n7,500.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,082.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,496.3 \n\nRoyalties \n\n4,107.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,886.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,518.7 \n\nInitial fees \n\n48.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n44.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n86.5 \n\nRevenues from franchised restaurants \n\n$ \n\n11,655.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,012.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,101.5 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFuture gross minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing conventional franchise arrangements are: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions \n\nOwned sites \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLeased sites \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,558.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,449.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,008.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,501.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,382.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,883.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,439.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,310.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,749.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,384.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,246.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,631.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,344.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,196.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,541.1 \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n11,155.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,354.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n20,509.7 \n\nTotal minimum payments \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,383.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,940.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,324.0 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2019 , net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $ 19.2 billion (including land of $ 5.4 billion ) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $ 10.9 billion . \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 46 \n\n##TABLE_START Leasing Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Renewal options are typically solely at the Company&#8217;s discretion. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index and fair-value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years. \n\nThe following table provides detail of rent expense: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRestaurants \n\n$ \n\n1,530.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,433.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,562.5 \n\nOther \n\n76.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n87.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n82.0 \n\nTotal rent expense \n\n$ \n\n1,606.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,521.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,644.5 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as follows&#8211;Company-operated restaurants: 2019 &#8211; $ 74.4 ; 2018 &#8211; $ 82.1 ; 2017 &#8211; $ 115.6 . Franchised restaurants: 2019 &#8211; $ 200.7 ; 2018 &#8211; $ 200.8 ; 2017 &#8211; $ 204.9 . \n\nThe amount of the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability recorded at transition included known escalations and renewal option periods reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company, and are not currently a future obligation. \n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in our lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the Asset and Liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. \n\nIn addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company&#8217;s lease portfolio. \n\nAs the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. The weighted average discount rate used for operating leases was 4.0 % as of December 31, 2019 . \n\nAs of December 31, 2019, maturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions \n\nTotal * \n\n$ \n\n1,161.9 \n\n1,132.8 \n\n1,091.4 \n\n1,052.6 \n\n1,010.3 \n\nThereafter \n\n13,573.6 \n\nTotal lease payments \n\n19,022.6 \n\nLess: imputed interest \n\n( 5,643.8 \n\n) \n\nPresent value of lease liability \n\n$ \n\n13,378.8 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * \n\nTotal lease payments include option periods that are reasonably assured of being exercised.

The lease liability will continue to be impacted by new leases, lease modifications, lease terminations, reevaluation of likely-term due to new facts and circumstances, and foreign currency. \n\nAs of December 31, 2019 , the Weighted Average Lease Term remaining that is included in the maturities of lease liabilities was 20 years. \n\nAs of December 31, 2018, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, future minimum payments required under existing operating leases with initial terms of one year or more were: ##TABLE_START In millions \n\nRestaurant \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal * \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,093.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n51.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,144.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,032.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n51.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,083.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n955.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n45.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,001.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n873.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n35.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n909.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n806.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n24.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n830.6 \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n7,132.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n164.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,297.2 \n\nTotal minimum payments \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,893.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n373.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,266.3 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START * \n\nFuture minimum payments exclude option periods that have not yet been exercised. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 47 \n\n##TABLE_START Contingencies \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers.

A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in a particular matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.

The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective method, resulting in a cumulative catch up adjustment of $57 million, the majority of which was recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. \n\nThe Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in SAB 118. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 48 \n\nSAB 118 measurement period \n\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes , primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. \n\nOne-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\"E&#38;P\"), the tax on which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability of approximately $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Upon further analysis of the Tax Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS, the Company increased its December 31, 2017 provisional amount by approximately $ 75 million during 2018. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of approximately $ 500 million . No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018. \n\nThe provision for income taxes, classified by the timing and location of payment, was as follows: ##TABLE_START In millions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. federal \n\n$ \n\n521.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n292.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,030.8 \n\nU.S. state \n\n194.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n183.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n169.8 \n\nOutside the U.S. \n\n1,126.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,312.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,217.0 \n\nCurrent tax provision \n\n1,843.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,789.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,417.6 \n\nU.S. federal \n\n38.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n145.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 120.1 \n\n) \n\nU.S. state \n\n20.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n18.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n12.8 \n\nOutside the U.S. \n\n91.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 61.8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n70.9 \n\nDeferred tax provision \n\n149.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n102.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 36.4 \n\n) \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n$ \n\n1,992.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,891.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,381.2 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet deferred tax liabilities consisted of: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions \n\nDecember 31, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLease right-of-use asset \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,296.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nProperty and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,316.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,288.9 \n\nIntangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n334.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n312.3 \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n511.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n347.9 \n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,459.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,949.1 \n\nLease liability \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 3,331.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nIntangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1,051.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1,081.5 \n\n) \n\nProperty and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 585.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 658.9 \n\n) \n\nDeferred foreign tax credits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 311.2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 216.6 \n\n) \n\nEmployee benefit plans \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 192.3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 213.3 \n\n) \n\nDeferred revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 145.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 138.9 \n\n) \n\nOperating loss carryforwards \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 81.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 45.7 \n\n) \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 323.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 269.2 \n\n) \n\nTotal deferred tax assets before valuation allowance \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 6,021.8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 2,624.1 \n\n) \n\nValuation allowance \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n741.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n671.1 \n\nNet deferred tax (assets) liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n179.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 3.9 \n\n) \n\nBalance sheet presentation: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDeferred income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,318.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,215.5 \n\nOther assets-miscellaneous \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1,138.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1,219.4 \n\n) \n\nNet deferred tax (assets) liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n179.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n( 3.9 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 360.3 million , of which $ 232.7 million has an indefinite carryforward. The remainder will expire at various dates from 2020 to 2038. \n\nPrior to 2018, the Company's effective income tax rate was generally lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because foreign income was generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that were below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate and reflected the impact of global transfer pricing. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate to 21 % . As a result, the Company&#8217;s 2019 and 2018 effective income tax rates are higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and foreign income that is subject to local statutory country tax rates that are above the 21% U.S. statutory tax rate. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 49 \n\nThe statutory U.S. federal income tax rate reconciles to the effective income tax rates as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate \n\n21.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n35.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\nState income taxes, net of related federal income tax benefit \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\nForeign income taxed at different rates \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 4.6 \n\n) \n\nTransition tax \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n13.7 \n\nUS net deferred tax liability remeasurement \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 6.0 \n\n) \n\nForeign tax credit redetermination regulations \n\n( 1.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther, net \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\nEffective income tax rates \n\n24.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n39.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company&#8217;s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $ 1,439.1 million and $ 1,342.8 million , respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $ 880 million of the total as of December 31, 2019 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor. \n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START In millions \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance at January 1 \n\n$ \n\n1,342.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,180.4 \n\nDecreases for positions taken in prior years \n\n( 18.3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 64.1 \n\n) \n\nIncreases for positions taken in prior years \n\n107.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n180.8 \n\nIncreases for positions related to the current year \n\n88.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n75.1 \n\nSettlements with taxing authorities \n\n( 68.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 24.1 \n\n) \n\nLapsing of statutes of limitations \n\n( 12.2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n( 5.3 \n\n) \n\nBalance at December 31 (1) \n\n$ \n\n1,439.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,342.8 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nOf this amount, $ 1,285.3 million and $ 1,313.7 million are included in Long-term income taxes for 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and $ 138.8 million and $ 12.5 million are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets for 2019 and 2018, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remainder is included in Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nIn 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) issued a Revenue Agent Report (&#8220;RAR&#8221;) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December 2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and, during 2019, the Company and the IRS Appeals team continued to have a dialogue regarding these disagreed transfer pricing matters. As of December 31, 2019, the Company does not yet have a signed closing agreement with the IRS related to the settlement of these issues. \n\nIn 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company&#8217;s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process. The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $ 980 million within the next 12 months, of which only an immaterial amount would favorably affect the effective tax rate. This would be due to the possible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. \n\nIn addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate. \n\nThe Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009. \n\nThe Company had $ 174.4 million and $ 152.0 million accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $ 39.9 million in 2019 , $ 13.9 million in 2018, and $ 34.9 million in 2017 , which are included in the provision for income taxes. \n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries, which were predominantly taxed in the U.S. as a result of the transition tax provisions enacted under the Tax Act. Management does not assert that these previously-taxed unremitted earnings are indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. Accordingly, the Company has provided deferred taxes for the tax effects incremental to the transition tax. We have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside basis differences are indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis differences is not practicable. \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 50 \n\n##TABLE_START Employee Benefit Plans \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company's 401k Plan is maintained for U.S.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. The 401(k) feature allows participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) from cash contributions and through July 31, 2018 from shares released under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Effective August 1, 2018, the contributions are matched only through cash contributions. \n\nAll current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in eight investment alternatives as well as McDonald&#8217;s stock in accordance with each participant&#8217;s investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20 % investment in McDonald&#8217;s stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future contributions. \n\nThe Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the 401k Plan because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401k Plan. Total liabilities were $ 435.0 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 437.4 million at December 31, 2018 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. At December 31, 2019 , derivatives with a fair value of $ 179.1 million indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $ 187.7 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Miscellaneous other assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general &#38; administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the Company&#8217;s stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares. \n\nTotal U.S. costs for the 401k Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2019 &#8211; $ 30.4 ; 2018 &#8211; $ 18.0 ; 2017 &#8211; $ 19.3 . Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2019 &#8211; $ 35.3 ; 2018 &#8211; $ 33.7 ; 2017 &#8211; $ 43.3 . \n\nThe total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $ 42.3 million and $ 40.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Other post-retirement benefits and post-employment benefits were immaterial to the Consolidated Income Statement. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 51 \n\n##TABLE_START Debt Financing \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS \n\nAt December 31, 2019 , the Company had a line of credit agreement, of which $ 3.5 billion expires in December 2023 . The Company incurs fees of 0.080 % per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are primarily based on the Company&#8217;s long-term credit rating assigned by Moody&#8217;s and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s . In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest . \n\nThe weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 1.9 % at December 31, 2019 (based on $ 242.4 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $ 899.3 million of commercial paper outstanding) and 2.6 % at December 31, 2018 (based on $ 253.5 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $ 99.9 million of commercial paper outstanding). \n\nDEBT OBLIGATIONS \n\nThe Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Company&#8217;s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#8217;s business. Certain of the Company&#8217;s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries.

The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 42.5 million at December 31, 2019 , including 26.5 million available for future grants. \n\nSTOCK OPTIONS \n\nStock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. \n\nIntrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value of the Company&#8217;s stock and the exercise price. During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 356.1 million , $ 364.4 million and $ 353.6 million , respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during 2019 was $ 350.5 million and the tax benefit realized from stock options exercised totaled $ 70.5 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program to satisfy share-based exercises. \n\nA summary of the status of the Company&#8217;s stock option grants as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOptions \n\nShares in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\nexercise \n\nprice \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\nremaining \n\ncontractual \n\nlife in years \n\n&#160; \n\nAggregate \n\nintrinsic \n\nvalue in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\nexercise \n\nprice \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\nexercise \n\nprice \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at beginning of year \n\n16.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n113.06 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n101.55 \n\n&#160; \n\n21.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n92.25 \n\nGranted \n\n2.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n175.17 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n157.95 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n128.74 \n\nExercised \n\n( 3.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n97.70 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 4.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n89.31 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 5.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n81.77 \n\nForfeited/expired \n\n( 0.4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n154.65 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n137.08 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1.0 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n118.38 \n\nOutstanding at end of year \n\n14.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n124.21 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,074.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n16.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n113.06 \n\n&#160; \n\n18.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n101.55 \n\nExercisable at end of year \n\n9.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n107.51 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n826.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n10.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRSUs \n\nRSUs generally vest 100 % on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonald&#8217;s common stock or cash, at the Company&#8217;s discretion. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Separately, Company executives have been awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \n\nA summary of the Company&#8217;s RSU activity during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRSUs \n\nShares in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\ngrant date \n\nfair value \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\ngrant date \n\nfair value \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares in \n\nmillions \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- \n\naverage \n\ngrant date \n\nfair value \n\n&#160; \n\nNonvested at beginning of year \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n132.56 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n107.34 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n94.13 \n\nGranted \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n171.48 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n158.28 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n123.98 \n\nVested \n\n( 0.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n116.42 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n91.20 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n87.18 \n\nForfeited \n\n( 0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n153.58 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n132.14 \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n117.24 \n\nNonvested at end of year \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n150.95 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n132.56 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n107.34 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe total fair value of RSUs vested during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 111.0 million , $ 117.9 million and $ 87.6 million , respectively.

The spread of this virus has caused business disruption beginning in January 2020, due to the closure of some restaurants, modified operating hours in certain restaurants that remain open, and resulting traffic declines in our China market. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty around the duration. Therefore, while we expect this matter to negatively impact our results, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the China market represented approximately 5 % of Systemwide sales, 1 % of consolidated revenues and 3 % of consolidated operating income. \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 53 \n\n##TABLE_START Quarterly Results (Unaudited) \n\n&#160;

\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe financial statements were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n\n##TABLE_START I. \n\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START II. \n\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START III. \n\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. \n\nManagement assessed the design and effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). \n\nBased on management&#8217;s assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2019 , management believes that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective. \n\nErnst &#38; Young, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 and the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action. \n\nMcDONALD&#8217;S CORPORATION \n\nFebruary 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 55 \n\n##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonald&#8217;s Corporation \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonald&#8217;s Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards \n\nAs discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 56 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nDescription of the Matter \n\nAs described in the income taxes footnote to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits, which includes transfer pricing matters, totaled $1,439 &#160; million at December 31, 2019. The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in management&#8217;s judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management&#8217;s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. \n\nAuditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions was challenging because the measurement is based on judgmental interpretations of complex tax laws and legal rulings and because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm&#8217;s-length transaction). \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s process to assess the technical merits and measure unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions. For example, we tested management&#8217;s review of the unrecognized tax benefit calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to determine the ranges of outcomes, pricing conclusions reached in management&#8217;s transfer pricing studies, and the assessment of other third-party information. \n\nWith the assistance of our income tax professionals, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical merits of the Company&#8217;s position and testing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing. For example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclusions reached in the transfer pricing studies executed by management, and compared the methods used to alternative methods and industry benchmarks. We also reviewed the Company&#8217;s communications with the relevant tax authorities and any advice obtained by the Company from third-party advisors. In addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement activity, income tax laws, and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the positions and the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nERNST &#38; YOUNG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1964. \n\nChicago, Illinois \n\nFebruary 26, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 57 \n\n##TABLE_START Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonald&#8217;s Corporation \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited McDonald&#8217;s Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, McDonald&#8217;s Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of McDonald&#8217;s Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nERNST &#38; YOUNG LLP \n\nChicago, Illinois \n\nFebruary 26, 2020 \n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 58 \n\n##TABLE_START "}
