The results of operations for HTSI are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the sale. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nDuring 2018, Honeywell continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create long-term shareowner value. We grew net sales 3% to $41,802 million and grew income before taxes 8% to $7,487 million. The improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent, rigorous deployment of the Honeywell Operating System as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. We have continued our focus on commercial excellence processes, such as Velocity Product Development (&#147;VPD&#148;), to drive higher sales at better margins. \n\nWe are careful not to allow the attainment of short-term financial results to imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. Hence, as part of the announcement in October 2017 of the results of our portfolio review, we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the world&#146;s leading software industrial companies. Our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2018 we deployed capital of $7.6 billion, including the following: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Capital Investment &#151;we invested over $0.8 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return projects. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Dividends &#151;In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $2.3 billion and increased our annual dividend rate by 10%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend in line with earnings. The dividend increase in September 2018 marked the ninth consecutive double-digit increase since 2010. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Share Repurchases &#151;we continue to repurchase our shares with the goal of keeping share count flat and by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In 2018, we repurchased 26.5 million shares for $4.0 billion. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Mergers and Acquisitions &#151;we deployed approximately $0.5 billion during 2018 on acquisitions. \n\n##TABLE_END CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nNet Sales \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2018 \n\n&#160; 2017 \n\n&#160; 2016 \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n41,802 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n40,534 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n39,302 \n\n&#160; % change compared with prior period \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END The change in net sales is attributable to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2018 Versus 2017 \n\n&#160; 2017 Versus 2016 \n\nVolume \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3% \n\n&#160; Price \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1% \n\n&#160; Acquisitions/Divestitures \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (4)% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1)% \n\n&#160; Foreign Currency Translation \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 0% \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3% \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3% \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis. \n\nThe foreign currency translation impact in 2018 compared with 2017 was principally driven by the strengthening on average year over year of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. \n\nThe foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat.

In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#147;U.S. Tax Reform&#148;), which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and the Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily from the estimated impacts of U.S. Tax Reform of approximately $3.8 billion, partially offset by lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily from lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. \n\nFor further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $285 million, $177 million and $228 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2019, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-U.S. cash as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Years Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; 2018 \n\n&#160; 2017 \n\n&#160; 2016 \n\nCash provided by (used for): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,434 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,966 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n5,498 \n\n&#160; Investing activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,027 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (3,574 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (3,342 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancing activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (5,032 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (3,516 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 346 \n\n&#160; Effect of exchange rate changes on cash \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (201 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 340 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (114 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,228 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(784 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,388 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 2018 compared with 2017 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $239 million increase in customer advances and deferred income and lower cash tax payments of $185 million. \n\nCash provided by investing activities increased by $4,601 million primarily due to a net $4,302 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, and a $620 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $453 million. \n\nCash used for financing activities increased by $1,516 million primarily due to an increase in net debt payments of $2,622 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,364 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $153 million, partially offset by net spin separation funding of $2,622 million net of spin-off cash. \n\n2017 compared with 2016 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $504 million increase in segment profit and a $294 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable accounts payable partially offset by inventory and accounts receivable), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of $609 million. \n\nCash used for investing activities increased by $232 million primarily due to (i) a net $2,056 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of $500 million of settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $296 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. in 2016), partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,491 million (most significantly Intelligrated in 2016). \n\nCash provided by financing activities increased by $3,862 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $2,827 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $699 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $204 million. \n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity \n\nEach of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. \n\nA source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was (0.31%) and as of December 31, 2017 was (0.17%). \n\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2018, Standard and Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P), Fitch, and Moody&#146;s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S&#38;P, Fitch and Moody&#146;s have Honeywell&#146;s rating outlook as &#147;stable.&#148; \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n\nSee Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 13 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. \n\nIn 2018, the Company repurchased $4,000 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans, and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $3.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. This authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. We will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions and debt repayments. \n\nSpecifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2019 to be as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures&#151;we expect to spend approximately $800 million for capital expenditures in 2019 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. \n\n##TABLE_END 27 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Share repurchases&#151;under the Company&#146;s share repurchase program, $3.7 billion is available as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Dividends&#151;we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.82 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2018, we realized $2,622 million in net cash proceeds from the spin-off of non-strategic businesses. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. \n\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2018: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Total (6)(7) \n\n&#160; Payments by Period \n\n&#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; 2019 \n\n&#160; 2020- 2021 \n\n&#160; 2022- 2023 \n\nLong-term debt, including capitalized leases (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n12,628 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,872 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,761 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,778 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4,217 \n\n&#160; Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3,049 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 313 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 519 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 389 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,828 \n\n&#160; Minimum operating lease payments \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 856 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 210 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 310 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 189 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 147 \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2,002 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,146 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 578 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 250 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 28 \n\n&#160; Estimated environmental liability payments (3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 755 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 175 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 355 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 172 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 53 \n\n&#160; Asbestos related liability payments (4) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2,514 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 245 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 786 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 710 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 773 \n\n&#160; Asbestos insurance recoveries (5) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (477 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (40 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (114 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (84 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (239 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n21,327 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4,921 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,195 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,404 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,807 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; (1) \n\n&#160; Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n&#160; (2) \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n&#160; (3) \n\n&#160; The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018. \n\n&#160; (4) \n\n&#160; These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018.

In addition, in 2018, 2017 and 2016 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $95 million, $82 million and $83 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nSpending related to known environmental matters was $218 million, $212 million and $228 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and is estimated to be approximately $175 million in 2019. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. \n\nReimbursements from Resideo for spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was $25 million in 2018 and is expected to be $140 million in 2019. Such reimbursements will offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. \n\nSee Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Face or Notional Amount \n\n&#160; Carrying Value (1) \n\n&#160; Fair Value (1) \n\n&#160; Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) \n\nDecember 31, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n12,628 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(12,628 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,133 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(654 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2,600 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (45 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (45 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (83 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 14,995 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 115 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 115 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (742 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nCross currency swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,200 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 32 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 32 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (117 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n13,924 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,924 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(14,695 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n(782 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2,600 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (233 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 9,273 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (58 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 29 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; (1) \n\n&#160; Asset or (liability). \n\n&#160; (2) \n\n&#160; A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. \n\n&#160; (3) \n\n&#160; Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 15 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#151;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. \n\nAsbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries, and Indemnification Receivables &#151;Honeywell&#146;s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (&#147;NARCO&#148;) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, \n\n&#160;\n\nestimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. This estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trust&#146;s lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual NARCO Trust experience. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (&#147;Bendix&#148;) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. \n\nAdditionally, in conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garrett&#146;s subsidiary has an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell as reimbursement for asbestos liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements of Garrett and its general ability to pay. \n\nSee Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries, and additional details regarding the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#151;We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our 2018, 2017 and 2016 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2018 \n\n&#160; 2017 \n\n&#160; 2016 \n\nDiscount Rate: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProjected benefit obligation \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3.68 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.20 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.46 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nService cost \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3.77 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.42 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.69 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest cost \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3.27 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3.49 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3.59 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; -1.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 20.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 9.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 11.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 6.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 31 \n\n&#160;\n\nThe MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans&#146; projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $37 million, $87 million and $273 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. \n\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 21 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2019 down from 7.75% for 2018 reflecting a re-balancing of assets to more fixed income during 2018. \n\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 4.35% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in Assumption \n\n&#160; Impact on 2019 Pension Ongoing Expense \n\n&#160; Impact on PBO \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate \n\n&#160; Decrease $20 million \n\n&#160; Increase $420 million \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate \n\n&#160; Increase $20 million \n\n&#160; Decrease $410 million \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Increase $41 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Decrease $41 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $590 million in 2019 compared with pension ongoing income of $992 million in 2018. The expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower actual asset returns in 2018 and a lower expected return on asset assumption for 2019 in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2019, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nLong-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) &#151;The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant negative industry or economic trends; or \n\n&#160; &#149; \n\n&#160; Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing &#151;Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. \n\nIncome Taxes &#151;On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. \n\nFor further discussion of additional income tax policies and provision items recorded in regards to U.S Tax Reform, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#151;We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates \n\n&#160;\n\ninclude inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation&#146;s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\n&#160;\n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n"}
