We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. \n\nManagement measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability . \n\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. &#32;&#32;Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. &#32;&#32;Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. \n\nOur business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . \n\nWe made certain strategic portfolio decisions, further discussed in Item 1. Business , which include the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAcquisition of 81 percent &#32;of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") in August 2018. The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020. &#32; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), where we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company, however, the held for sale criteria has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (\"Advent\") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDivestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Retail Industry \n\nWe operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (\"associates\"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \" Item 1A. Risk Factors ,\" and under \" Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements .\" \n\nCompany Performance Metrics \n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nstrong, efficient growth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nconsistent operating discipline; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nstrategic capital allocation. \n\n##TABLE_END As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. \n\nStrong, Efficient Growth \n\nOur objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. \n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. \n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWith Fuel \n\n&#160; \n\nFuel Impact \n\nWalmart U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1% \n\nSam's Club \n\n&#160; \n\n5.4% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0% \n\nTotal U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWalmart U.S. comparable sales increased 3.7% &#32;and 2.1% &#32;in fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 &#32;and fiscal 2018 , respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Sam's Club comparable sales increased 5.4% &#32;and 2.8% &#32;in fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club fiscal 2019 &#32;comparable sales were driven by strong traffic, which was aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs and fuel sales. These increases were partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations in fiscal 2019 . Sam's Club fiscal 2018 &#32;comp sales were driven by strong traffic and fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. \n\nConsistent Operating Discipline \n\nWe operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n510,329 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n495,761 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n2.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n107,147 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n106,510 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.5 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFor fiscal 2019 , operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 &#32; basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit . \n\nFor fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. \n\nStrategic Capital Allocation \n\nWe are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Total fiscal 2019 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year; the following table provides additional detail: \n\n##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\nAllocation of Capital Expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\neCommerce, technology, supply chain and other \n\n&#160; \n\n5,218 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,521 \n\nRemodels \n\n&#160; \n\n2,152 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,009 \n\nNew stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nTotal U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n7,683 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,444 \n\nWalmart International \n\n&#160; \n\n2,661 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,607 \n\nTotal capital expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,344 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,051 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nReturns \n\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources &#32;section. \n\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment \n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 3.4% &#32;and 5.2% &#32;for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. For fiscal 2019 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and also the $2.8 billion net unrealized loss on our JD.com investment. For fiscal 2018 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income. ROI was 14.2% &#32;for fiscal 2019 , which was flat compared to fiscal 2018 . \n\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. \n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. \n\nAlthough ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. &#32;&#32;Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of ROI will change upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases , primarily to replace the factor of 8 for rent expense with US GAAP operating lease assets. \n\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS \n\nNumerator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated net income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,523 \n\nDenominator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage total assets (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n211,909 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n201,674 \n\nReturn on assets (ROA) \n\n&#160; \n\n3.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT \n\nNumerator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,957 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,437 \n\n+ Interest income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n+ Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n10,678 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,529 \n\n+ Rent \n\n&#160; \n\n3,004 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,932 \n\n= Adjusted operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,856 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,050 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDenominator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage total assets (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n211,909 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n201,674 \n\n+ Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n85,107 \n\n&#160; \n\n79,995 \n\n- Average accounts payable (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n46,576 \n\n&#160; \n\n43,763 \n\n- Average accrued liabilities (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n22,141 \n\n&#160; \n\n21,388 \n\n+ Rent x 8 \n\n&#160; \n\n24,032 \n\n&#160; \n\n23,456 \n\n= Average invested capital \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n252,331 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n239,974 \n\nReturn on investment (ROI) \n\n&#160; \n\n14.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n14.2 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain Balance Sheet Data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal assets \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n219,295 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n204,522 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n198,825 \n\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n87,175 \n\n&#160; \n\n83,039 \n\n&#160; \n\n76,951 \n\nAccounts payable \n\n&#160; \n\n47,060 \n\n&#160; \n\n46,092 \n\n&#160; \n\n41,433 \n\nAccrued liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n22,159 \n\n&#160; \n\n22,122 \n\n&#160; \n\n20,654 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32;(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. &#32; &#32;Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources &#32;for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. \n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion &#32;and $31.7 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $17.4 billion , $18.3 billion &#32;and $21.1 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 &#32;declined when compared to fiscal 2018 &#32;primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 &#32;declined when compared to fiscal 2018 &#32; due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 &#32;from fiscal 2017 &#32;were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. \n\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . \n\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. \n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,753 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,337 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,673 \n\nPayments for property and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,344 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,051 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,619 \n\n) \n\nFree cash flow \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,409 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,286 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,054 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(24,036 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9,079 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(13,896 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,537 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19,875 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19,072 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nConsolidated Results of Operations \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n514,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n500,343 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n485,873 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n% \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n510,329 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n495,761 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n481,317 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n2.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n% \n\nTotal U.S. calendar comparable sales increase \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n% \n\nGross profit rate \n\n&#160; \n\n24.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.9 \n\n% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,957 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,764 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\nConsolidated net income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,523 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,293 \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n11,361 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,718 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,695 \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n1,129 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,158 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,164 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $14.1 billion &#32;or 2.8% &#32;and $14.5 billion &#32;or 3.0% &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales increased $14.6 billion &#32;or 2.9% &#32;and $14.4 billion &#32;or 3.0% &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets and net sales \n\nfrom Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019 , the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018 , a $ 3.1 &#32;billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil &#32;in the International segment, and $0.7 billion &#32;of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates . For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 &#32;was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses &#32;and the $0.5 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\nOur gross profit rate decreased 18 &#32;and 26 basis points for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the consolidation of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. \n\nMembership and other income decreased for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia in our International Segment. Membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 &#32;included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia, along with a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club, these gains were offset by gains recognized in fiscal 2017 . \n\nFor fiscal 2019 , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 &#32;basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit . \n\nFor fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. \n\nOther losses were $8.4 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion pre-tax decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com. Fiscal 2018 &#32;results included loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.1 billion . \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 37.4% &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 30.4% &#32;for fiscal 2018 , and 30.3% for fiscal 2017 . Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 &#32;primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 &#32;is presented in Note 9 &#32;in the \" Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .\" \n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $7.2 billion &#32;and $10.5 billion &#32;of consolidated net income for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.3 billion &#32;and $3.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (\"EPS\") was $2.26 , $3.28 &#32;and $4.38 &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. \n\nWalmart U.S. Segment \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n331,666 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n318,477 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n307,833 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\n3.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n% \n\nCalendar comparable sales increase \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,386 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,995 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,012 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n% \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n4,769 \n\n4,761 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,672 \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n705 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $13.2 billion &#32;or 4.1% &#32;and $10.6 billion or 3.5% &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 3.7% &#32;and 2.1% &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth.

Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , year-over-year growth in retail square feet further contributed to the year-over-year increase. \n\nGross profit rate decreased 28 &#32;and 24 basis points for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 &#32;was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise. \n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 23 &#32;basis points for fiscal 2019 &#32;and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 &#32;was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million. These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019. \n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $391 million &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. \n\nWalmart International Segment \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n120,824 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n118,068 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n116,119 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n2.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.9 \n\n)% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,883 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,229 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,737 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\n&#160;% \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n5,993 \n\n6,360 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,363 \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n373 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.8 billion &#32;or 2.3% &#32;and $1.9 billion or 1.7% &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $ 3.1 &#32;billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil , a $0.7 billion &#32;negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates , the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses &#32;and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\nGross profit rate decreased 41 &#32;and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to Flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets. \n\nMembership and other income decreased 22.4% and 14.0% for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 &#32;was due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 &#32;included the $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal &#32; 2017 , which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile . \n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 &#32;basis points for fiscal 2019 &#32;and was flat for 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 &#32;was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019 . While fiscal 2018 &#32;was benefited by an increase in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down &#32;the first party Brazil eCommerce operations . \n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million &#32;and $508 million for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. \n\nSam's Club Segment \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncluding Fuel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n57,839 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n59,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n57,365 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n% \n\nCalendar comparable sales increase \n\n&#160; \n\n5.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,520 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,628 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n597 \n\n&#160; \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n80 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExcluding Fuel (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n52,332 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n54,456 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n53,289 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,383 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,576 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32; \n\n(1) We believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. \n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased $1.4 billion &#32;or 2.3% &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% &#32;for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018 , as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 . Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion &#32;partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019 . For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2018 . \n\nGross profit rate was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 &#32;and decreased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , gross profit rate was benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 &#32;and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019 , which have lower margins. This benefit to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, increased shrink, increased eCommerce shipping costs and the investment in cash rewards. \n\nMembership and other income increased 2.6% &#32;and 2.3% for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an increase of 1.5% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration and gains on property sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration. \n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 99 &#32;basis points for fiscal 2019 &#32;and increased 83 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparable period related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. This charge resulted in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2018 . \n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $605 million &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;and decreased $713 million f or fiscal &#32; 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nLiquidity \n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. \n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,753 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,337 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,673 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion &#32;and $31.7 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 &#32;declined when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. \n\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital \n\nCash and cash equivalents were $7.7 billion &#32;and $6.8 billion &#32;as of January 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.6 billion &#32;and $18.9 billion &#32;as of January 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 &#32;compared to 2018 &#32;was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart. \n\nHistorically, we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion &#32;of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . \n\nAs of January 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion &#32;and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion &#32;as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion &#32;can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. \n\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(24,036 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9,079 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(13,896 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $24.0 billion , $9.1 billion &#32;and $13.9 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities increased $15.0 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 &#32;when compared to the previous fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the $13.8 billion &#32;payment for Flipkart , net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 &#32;included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico, while fiscal 2017 &#32;included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. (\"jet.com\") for $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of shares in JD.com (\"JD\"). Refer to Note 13 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the \" Strategic Capital Allocation \" section in our Company Performance Metrics &#32;for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2019 &#32;and 2018 . \n\nGrowth Activities \n\nFor the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 &#32;(\"fiscal 2020 \"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion. In fiscal 2020 , we expect to add approximately 300 new stores in Walmart International, primarily in Mexico, Central America and China, and add less than 10 stores in Walmart U.S. \n\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,537 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(19,875 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(19,072 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2019 &#32;net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion &#32;when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Fiscal 2018 &#32;net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major categories below. \n\nShort-term Borrowings \n\nNet cash flows provided by short-term borrowings were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 and increased $4.1 billion &#32;in fiscal 2018 , when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2018 , the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment. \n\nThe following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,389 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,386 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,493 \n\nAverage daily short-term borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n10,625 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,131 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,691 \n\nAnnual weighted-average interest rate \n\n&#160; \n\n2.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to our short-term borrowings, we have $15.0 billion &#32;of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion &#32;of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. , as of January 31, 2019 , that provide additional liquidity, if needed. \n\nLong-term Debt \n\nThe following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2019 : ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt due within one year \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nBalances as of February 1, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33,783 \n\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n15,872 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,872 \n\nPayments of long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,763 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(21 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,784 \n\n) \n\nReclassifications of long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n1,864 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,864 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(512 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(475 \n\n) \n\nBalances as of January 31, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,876 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n43,520 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n45,396 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur total long-term debt increased $11.6 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes . \n\nDividends \n\nOur total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.1 billion &#32;and $6.2 billion &#32;for fiscal 2019 , 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively.

All repurchases made during &#32;fiscal 2019 &#32; were made under the current &#32; $20 billion &#32; share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. &#32;&#32;As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion &#160; of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. &#32; \n\nWe regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. &#32;&#32;We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.

Repurchases of Company stock returned to a more normalized level in the latter half of fiscal 2019. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nWe believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. \n\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Rating agency \n\n&#160; \n\nCommercial paper \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt \n\nStandard &#38; Poor's \n\n&#160; \n\nA-1+ \n\n&#160; \n\nAA \n\nMoody's Investors Service \n\n&#160; \n\nP-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nAa2 \n\nFitch Ratings \n\n&#160; \n\nF1+ \n\n&#160; \n\nAA \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2019 : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\nTotal \n\n2021-2022 \n\n2023-2024 \n\nThereafter \n\nRecorded contractual obligations: \n\nLong-term debt (1) \n\n$ \n\n45,396 \n\n$ \n\n1,876 \n\n$ \n\n8,427 \n\n$ \n\n7,439 \n\n$ \n\n27,654 \n\nShort-term borrowings \n\n5,225 \n\n5,225 \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCapital lease and financing obligations (2) \n\n9,896 \n\n1,650 \n\n1,260 \n\n6,069 \n\nUnrecorded contractual obligations: \n\nNon-cancelable operating leases (3) \n\n14,118 \n\n1,856 \n\n3,075 \n\n2,296 \n\n6,891 \n\nEstimated interest on long-term debt \n\n23,039 \n\n1,745 \n\n3,219 \n\n2,851 \n\n15,224 \n\nSyndicated and other letters of credit \n\n2,180 \n\n2,180 \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations \n\n14,343 \n\n7,325 \n\n4,249 \n\n1,441 \n\n1,328 \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n$ \n\n114,197 \n\n$ \n\n21,124 \n\n$ \n\n20,620 \n\n$ \n\n15,287 \n\n$ \n\n57,166 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\n\"Long-term debt\" includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\n\"Capital lease and financing obligations\" represents undiscounted aggregate minimum annual rentals, which are recorded on the balance sheet at present value. Refer to Note 11 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nRepresents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 . \n\n##TABLE_END Under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2019 , the indemnification liability recorded was $0.8 billion &#32;and included in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nAdditionally, we have $15.0 billion &#32;of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion &#32;of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. &#32;which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nEstimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2019 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. \n\nPurchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. \n\nThe expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. \n\nIn addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.3 billion &#32;of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nAs of January 31, 2019 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \n\nOther Matters \n\nWe discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters and possible effects of those matters on Walmart's business, including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A &#32;of this Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and under the sub-caption \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 10 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies,\" and appears elsewhere herein. We discuss the \"ASDA Equal Value Claims\" which includes certain existing employment claims against our United Kingdom subsidiary, ASDA Stores, Ltd., including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A &#32;of this Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and under the sub-caption \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 10 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies,\" and appears elsewhere herein. We also discuss the National Prescription Opiate Litigation and related matters including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A &#32;of this Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and under the sub-caption \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 10 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies,\" and appears elsewhere herein. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the FCPA investigation, ASDA Equal Value Claims, and National Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part I, Item 3 &#32;herein under the caption \"Legal Proceedings.\" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the Company incurring a material liability upon their final resolution. \n\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates \n\nManagement strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. \n\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. \n\nInventories \n\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2019 &#32;and 2018 , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. \n\nImpairment of Assets \n\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2019 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. For fiscal 2018, although impairment charges were $1.4 billion, these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in &#32; Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material. \n\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets \n\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \n\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. &#32;&#32;As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. \n\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. \n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates. \n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard&#8211;setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. \n\n##TABLE_START "}
