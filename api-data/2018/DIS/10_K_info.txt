Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting guidance. Segment operating income for fiscal 2019 includes a $91 million benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the timing of recognition of TV/SVOD distribution revenue at Studio Entertainment. Further information about our adoption of ASC 606 is provided in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . \n\n2019 vs. 2018 \n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company acquired TFCF on March 20, 2019. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of TFCF, we acquired a controlling interest in Hulu. The Company began consolidating the results of TFCF and Hulu effective March 20, 2019. \n\nRevenues for fiscal 2019 increased 17% , or $10.1 billion , to $69.6 billion ; net income attributable to Disney decreased 12% , or $1.5 billion , to $11.1 billion ; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney (EPS) decreased 25% , or $2.09 to $6.27 . The decrease in EPS was due to the comparison to a benefit in fiscal 2018 from U.S. federal income tax legislation (Tax Act), which was enacted in fiscal 2018 (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), amortization expense on intangibles and the fair value step-up on film and television costs from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu, an increase in shares outstanding and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF. The increase in shares outstanding was due to shares that were issued in connection with the acquisition of TFCF. Additionally, the decrease in EPS reflected lower segment operating income, which included a $0.5 billion adverse impact from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu in the current year, the absence of a gain recognized in the prior year on the sale of real estate, a charge in the current year for the extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a non-cash gain recognized in the current year in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hulu (Hulu Gain) (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Segment operating income from our legacy operations decreased due to higher losses at Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International and lower results at Media Networks, partially offset by growth at Parks, Experiences and Products. \n\nRevenues \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 19% , or $9.7 billion , to $60.5 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu&#8217;s operations and to a lesser extent, growth at our legacy operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher guest spending at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, higher theatrical distribution revenue and growth in merchandise licensing. These increases were partially offset by lower ABC Studios program sales. Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (Foreign Exchange Impact). \n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5% , or $0.5 billion , to $9.0 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations and growth at our legacy operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to guest spending growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nCosts and expenses \n\nCost of services for fiscal 2019 increased 32% , or $8.9 billion , to $36.5 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu&#8217;s operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. The increase in costs at our legacy operations reflected higher programming and production costs, labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts and an increase in film cost amortization. Cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nCost of products for fiscal 2019 increased 7% , or $0.4 billion , to $5.6 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF's operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. The increase in costs at our legacy operations was due to higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise and labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment volumes. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2019 increased 30% , or $2.7 billion , to $11.5 billion , due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu&#8217;s operations, and increases in marketing and compensation costs at our legacy operations.

These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest and a benefit from market value adjustments on pay-floating interest rate swap options. \n\nThe increase in interest income, investment income and other for the year was due to a $102 million benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost, and higher interest income on cash balances. The comparable benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs of $30 million in the prior year was reported in &#8220;Costs and expenses.&#8221; The benefit in the current year was due to the expected return on pension plan assets exceeding interest expense on plan liabilities and amortization of prior net actuarial losses. \n\nEquity in the Loss of Investees \n\nEquity in the loss of investees of $103 million was comparable to the prior year as higher impairments in the current year were offset by lower equity losses from Hulu as a result of our consolidation of Hulu following the TFCF acquisition. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nEffective income tax rate - continuing operations \n\n21.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n11.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(10.4 \n\n) \n\nppt \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Act, of which the most significant impacts were a $1.7 billion net benefit (11 percentage points) that was recognized in the prior year, partially offset by a current year benefit from a reduction in the Company&#8217;s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 21% in fiscal 2019 from 24.5% in fiscal 2018. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter/(Worse) \n\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(472 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(468 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was comparable to the prior year as the accretion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Hulu (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and a lower loss allocation to the noncontrolling interest holders of BAMTech were offset by a higher loss from our direct-to-consumer sports business. \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nNet income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the RSNs. \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\nRevenues for fiscal 2018 increased 8% , or $4.3 billion , to $59.4 billion ; net income attributable to Disney increased 40% , or $3.6 billion , to $12.6 billion ; and EPS for the year increased 47% , or $2.67 to $8.36 . The EPS increase in fiscal 2018 was due to a benefit from the Tax Act, higher segment operating income, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and gains on the sale of real estate and property rights. These increases were partially \n\noffset by the comparison to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech, impairments of our Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments in fiscal 2018 and higher net interest and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. The increase in segment operating income was due to growth at our Studio Entertainment, Parks, Experiences and Products and Media Networks segments, partially offset by lower results at our Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nRevenues \n\nService revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9% , or $4.0 billion , to $50.9 billion , due to higher theatrical distribution revenue, growth in guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, increased TV/SVOD distribution revenue and the consolidation of BAMTech. In September 2017, the Company increased its ownership in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. \n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 3% , or $0.3 billion , to $8.6 billion , due to guest spending and volume growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in retail store sales. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nCosts and expenses \n\nCost of services for fiscal 2018 increased 9% , or $2.2 billion , to $27.5 billion , due to higher film and television cost amortization driven by an increase in theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution revenue and contractual rate increases for television programming. Costs of services also increased due to the consolidation of BAMTech and higher costs at our theme parks and resorts reflecting cost inflation, higher technology and operations support expenses and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. \n\nCost of products for fiscal 2018 increased 4% , or $0.2 billion , to $5.2 billion due to cost inflation and higher guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2018 increased 8% , or $0.7 billion , to $8.9 billion , due to higher marketing spend, the consolidation of BAMTech, costs incurred in connection with the TFCF acquisition and an increase in compensation costs. \n\nDepreciation and amortization costs increased 8% , or $0.2 billion , to $3.0 billion primarily due to depreciation of new attractions at our theme parks and resorts and the consolidation of BAMTech. Depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $33 million and $98 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Charges in fiscal 2018 were due to severance costs.

These decreases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in fiscal 2017. The decrease at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses. \n\nOur Media Networks segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising (excluding addressable ad sales) and other revenues, which include the sale and distribution of television programs. Significant expenses include amortization of programming and production costs, participations and residuals expense, technical support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. \n\nOur Parks, Experiences and Products segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing intellectual properties and sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings. \n\nOur Studio Entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and TV/SVOD markets, stage play ticket sales and licensing of our intellectual properties for use in live entertainment productions. Significant expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, marketing and sales costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales. \n\nOur Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising sales (includes addressable ad sales), subscription fees for our DTC streaming and other services, and fees charged for technology support services. Significant expenses include operating expenses, selling general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses include programming and production costs (including programming, production and branded digital content obtained from other Company segments), technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. \n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. \n\nThe following table reconciles income from continuing operations before income taxes to total segment operating income. &#160;

Cable Networks advertising revenue reflected increases of 11% from the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations and 2% from higher impressions reflecting higher units delivered, partially offset by lower average viewership. Broadcasting advertising revenue was comparable to the prior-year period as increases of 7% from higher network rates and 2% from the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations were offset by a decrease of 9% from average viewership. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $1,000 million , due to sales of TFCF programs, partially offset by a decrease in ABC Studios program sales. The decrease in ABC Studios program sales reflects the prior-year sales of Daredevil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist , partially offset by the current-year sale of The Punisher . \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $2,142 million from $12,555 million to $14,697 million . At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $1,255 million due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations and contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $887 million due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations, partially offset by the impact of lower ABC Studios program sales. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased from $1,899 million to $2,361 million due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 2%, or $141 million , to $7,479 million due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations, partially offset by lower income from ABC Studios program sales. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n16,486 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n8,341 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,312 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,827 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,922 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n5,425 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,225 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n1,351 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,402 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,479 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,338 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Media Networks \n\nThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Media Network segment that are excluded from segment operating income: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Better/(Worse) \n\nAmortization of TFCF intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs (1) \n\n$ \n\n(684 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(105 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100) \n\n&#160;% \n\nImpairment of equity investments \n\n(184 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100) \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $359 million and amortization of intangible assets was $325 million . \n\nParks, Experiences and Products \n\nOperating results for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheme park admissions \n\n$ \n\n7,540 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,183 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nParks &#38; Experiences merchandise, food and beverage \n\n5,963 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,674 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nResorts and vacations \n\n6,266 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,938 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nMerchandise licensing and retail \n\n4,519 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,249 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nParks licensing and other \n\n1,937 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n26,225 \n\n&#160; \n\n24,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(14,015 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,326 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(3,133 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,930 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(2,306 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,327 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the loss of investees \n\n(13 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n6,758 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,095 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to an increase of 8% from higher average ticket prices, partially offset by decreases of 2% from lower attendance and 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in attendance was due to lower attendance at Shanghai Disney Resort. Attendance at our domestic theme parks was comparable to the prior year. \n\nParks &#38; Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to an increase of 6% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from lower volumes. \n\nThe increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 2% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from an increase in average ticket prices for cruise line sailings and 1% from the consolidation of TFCF's operations. \n\nMerchandise licensing and retail revenue growth was due to increase s of 3% from merchandise licensing, 1% from our retail stores, 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact and 1% from our publishing business due to the consolidation of TFCF's operations. The increase in merchandise licensing revenues was primarily due to higher revenue from products based on Toy Story, an increase in guaranteed shortfall recognition and higher revenues from Avengers and Frozen merchandise. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from products based on Star Wars and Cars. Higher revenues at our retail stores were due to an increase in online sales. \n\nThe increase in parks licensing and other revenue was due to the adoption of ASC 606 and higher real estate sales. The adoption of ASC 606 required certain cost reimbursements from licensees to be recognized as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2018 \n\nParks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAttendance \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nPer Capita Guest Spending \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nHotels &#160; (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOccupancy \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nAvailable Room Nights \n\n(in thousands) \n\n10,030 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,182 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,212 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,224 \n\nPer Room Guest Spending \n\n$353 \n\n&#160; \n\n$345 \n\n&#160; \n\n$330 \n\n&#160; \n\n$315 \n\n&#160; \n\n$348 \n\n&#160; \n\n$338 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nPer room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

Per room guest spending is stated at the fiscal 2018 average foreign exchange rate. \n\n##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include operating labor, which increased $237 million from $5,937 million to $6,174 million , cost of sales and distribution costs, which increased $154 million from $2,764 million to $2,918 million , and infrastructure costs, which increased $99 million from $2,370 million to $2,469 million . The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, including the impact of wage increases for union employees, partially offset by the comparison to a special domestic employee bonus that was recognized in fiscal 2018. The increase in cost of sales and distribution costs was driven by higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts. Higher infrastructure costs were due to an increase in technology spending and costs for new guest offerings, including expenses associated with Star Wars: Galaxy&#8217;s Edge. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased $199 million , from $2,255 million to $2,454 million , due to the recognition of certain cost reimbursements from licensees as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increase d $203 million from $2,930 million to $3,133 million primarily due to inflation and higher marketing spend at our parks and resorts. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 11% , or $663 million , to $6,758 million due to growth at our domestic theme parks and resorts and our consumer products businesses. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment to provide continuity with our legacy reporting: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSupplemental revenue detail \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nParks &#38; Experiences \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n$ \n\n17,369 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,161 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nInternational \n\n4,223 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,135 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nConsumer Products \n\n4,633 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,225 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nSupplemental operating income detail \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nParks &#38; Experiences \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n$ \n\n4,412 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,013 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nInternational \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nConsumer Products \n\n1,839 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,626 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,758 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,095 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheatrical distribution \n\n$ \n\n4,726 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,303 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nHome entertainment \n\n1,734 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,647 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other \n\n4,667 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,115 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n11,127 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,065 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(5,187 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,449 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(17 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(3,119 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,493 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(25 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(135 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(119 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n2,686 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,004 \n\n&#160; \n\n(11 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the comparison of four significant Disney live-action titles, Lion King, Aladdin, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo in the current year to no significant Disney live-action titles in the prior year, and the consolidation of TFCF's operations. These increases were partially offset by two Marvel titles, Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel and no Star Wars title in the current year compared to four Marvel titles, Avengers: Infinity War , Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and the Wasp , and two Star Wars titles, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Solo: A Star Wars Story in the prior year. The current year also included Toy Story 4 and Ralph Breaks the Internet , while the prior year included Incredibles 2 and Coco . \n\nHigher home entertainment revenue was due to an increase of 16% from the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations, partially offset by decreases of 9% from lower unit sales and 1% from a decrease in net effective pricing at our legacy operations. The decrease in unit sales was due to the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the prior year compared to no Star Wars release in the current year. Other significant titles in release included Avengers: Endgame , Incredibles 2 , Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp , and Ralph Breaks the Internet in the current year and Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok , Coco and Cars 3 in the prior year. \n\nHigher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to an increase of 14% from TV/SVOD distribution, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from Lucasfilm&#8217;s special effects business due to fewer projects. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution was due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which increase d $575 million , from $3,187 million to $3,762 million , due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations. Operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increased $163 million , from $1,262 million to $1,425 million , due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations, partially offset by fewer projects at Lucasfilm&#8217;s special effects business. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased $626 million from $2,493 million to $3,119 million due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations. \n\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 11% , or $318 million to $2,686 million due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations and lower home entertainment results, partially offset by decreases in film impairments and write-offs from our legacy operations. \n\nItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Studio Entertainment \n\nThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Studio Entertainment segment that are excluded from segment operating income: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Better/(Worse) \n\nAmortization of TFCF intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs (1) \n\n$ \n\n(206 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n(219 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100) \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $179 million and amortization of intangible assets was $27 million . \n\nDirect-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\nOperating results for the Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAffiliate fees \n\n$ \n\n2,740 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,372 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nAdvertising \n\n3,534 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,311 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;100 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription fees and other \n\n3,075 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;100 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n9,349 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,414 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;100 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(8,497 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,384 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(2,108 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,003 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(318 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(185 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(72 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the loss of investees \n\n(240 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(580 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Loss \n\n$ \n\n(1,814 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(738 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in affiliate fees was due to the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations and to a lesser extent, higher rates at our legacy operations, partially offset by an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nThe increase in advertising revenues was due to increases of $1,178 million in addressable advertising sales, driven by the consolidation of Hulu&#8217;s operations, and $1,045 million at our International Channels, driven by the consolidation of TFCF&#8217;s operations. \n\nSubscription fees and other revenue increased due to the consolidation of Hulu&#8217;s operations and, to a lesser extent, the consolidation of TFCF's international program sales and higher subscription fees for ESPN+, which launched in April 2018. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include an increase of $5,208 million in programming and production costs, from $1,572 million to $6,780 million , and an increase of $905 million in other operating expenses, from $812 million to $1,717 million . The increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF's operations and, to a lesser extent, the ramp up of our investment in ESPN+ and the upcoming launch of Disney+.

The decrease at Cable Networks was due to a decrease of 6% from lower impressions as lower average viewership was partially offset by higher units delivered. The decrease at Broadcasting was due to decreases of 7% from lower network impressions and 2% from lower impressions at the owned television stations, both of which were driven by lower average viewership. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increase d $392 million due to higher ABC Studios program sales driven by increased revenue from programs licensed to Hulu and higher sales of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy and Black-ish. Additionally, fiscal 2018 included the sales of Luke Cage , Daredevil and Jessica Jones compared to fiscal 2017 sales of The Punisher and The Defenders . \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increase d $486 million from $12,069 million to $12,555 million . At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increase d $317 million due to higher program sales and a higher average cost of network programming, including the impact of American Idol , Roseanne and The Goldbergs in fiscal 2018. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increase d $169 million due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming, partially offset by lower production costs. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nIncome from equity investees decrease d $55 million from $766 million to $711 million due to lower income from A+E driven by decreased advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 2% , or $142 million , to $7,338 million due to higher program sales and an increase at the Domestic Disney Channels, partially offset by lower income from equity investees. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n14,610 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,416 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n7,312 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,883 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,922 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,299 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n$ \n\n5,225 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nBroadcasting \n\n1,402 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,338 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,196 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nParks, Experiences and Products \n\nOperating results for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheme park admissions \n\n$ \n\n7,183 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,504 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nParks &#38; Experiences merchandise, food and beverage \n\n5,674 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,154 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nResorts and vacations \n\n5,938 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,378 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nMerchandise licensing and retail \n\n4,249 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,494 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nParks licensing and other \n\n1,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,494 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n24,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n23,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(13,326 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(12,455 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(2,930 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,896 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(2,327 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,161 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the loss of investees \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(25 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n6,095 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to increases of 6% from higher average ticket prices, 4% from attendance growth and 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Attendance growth included a favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew at Walt Disney World Resort. \n\nParks &#38; Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increase s of 5% from higher average guest spending, 3% from volume growth and 2% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Volume growth included a benefit from the favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew. \n\nThe increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 3% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from higher average ticket prices for cruise line sailings, 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact, 1% from an increase in passenger cruise ship days and 1% from higher occupied hotel room nights. Higher occupied hotel room nights were due to an increase at our international resorts, partially offset by a decrease at our domestic resorts, reflecting fewer available room nights at Walt Disney World Resort due to room refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units. \n\nMerchandise licensing and retail revenues were lower primarily due to decrease s of 2% from licensing, 2% from lower retail sales and 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in revenue from licensing was driven by a decrease in licensee settlements and lower revenues from products based on Frozen, Cars and Princess, partially offset by an increase from products based on Mickey and Minnie and Avengers. Lower retail revenue was driven by a decrease in comparable store sales at The Disney Stores, partially offset by higher online revenue. The decrease in comparable store sales reflected lower sales of Star Wars and Moana merchandise in the fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher sales of Mickey and Minnie merchandise. \n\nThe increase in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to an increase in real estate rental and sponsorship revenues. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2017 \n\nParks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAttendance \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nPer Capita Guest Spending \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n)% \n\nHotels &#160;(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOccupancy \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nAvailable Room Nights (in thousands) \n\n10,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,205 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,179 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n13,227 \n\nPer Room Guest Spending \n\n$345 \n\n&#160; \n\n$317 \n\n&#160; \n\n$297 \n\n&#160; \n\n$289 \n\n&#160; \n\n$334 \n\n&#160; \n\n$311 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nPer room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher volumes, an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. The increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to higher volumes and inflation. Higher infrastructure costs were driven by increased technology spending at our theme parks and resorts and inflation. Other operating expenses, which include costs such as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings increased $141 million from $2,114 million to $2,255 million due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact, inflation and new guest offerings at our theme parks and resorts. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased $34 million from $2,896 million to $2,930 million primarily due to inflation and higher technology spending, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. \n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $166 million from $2,161 million to $2,327 million primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and asset impairments in fiscal 2018. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 11% , or $608 million , to $6.1 billion due to growth at our domestic and international Parks &#38; Experiences, partially offset by decreases at our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment to provide continuity with our legacy reporting: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nSupplemental revenue detail \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nParks &#38; Experiences \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n$ \n\n16,161 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,812 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nInternational \n\n4,135 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,603 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nConsumer Products \n\n4,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,609 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4) \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,701 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n23,024 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nSupplemental operating income detail \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nParks &#38; Experiences \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n$ \n\n4,013 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,464 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nInternational \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\nConsumer Products \n\n1,626 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,713 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5) \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,095 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,487 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTheatrical distribution \n\n$ \n\n4,303 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,903 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nHome entertainment \n\n1,647 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,677 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other \n\n4,115 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,772 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n10,065 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,352 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(4,449 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,718 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(20 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(2,493 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,156 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(119 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(115 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n3,004 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,363 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the release of four Marvel titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two Marvel titles in fiscal 2017. The Marvel titles in fiscal 2018 were Avengers: Infinity War , Black Panther , Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and the Wasp , whereas fiscal 2017 included Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Doctor Strange . Other significant titles in fiscal 2018 included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Incredibles 2 and Coco , while fiscal 2017 included Beauty and the Beast, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Moana. \n\nLower home entertainment revenue reflected a 5% decrease from lower unit sales, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher average net effective pricing. Lower unit sales were driven by the success of Moana and Finding Dory in fiscal 2017 compared to Coco and Cars 3 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was also driven by three live-action titles in fiscal 2017 as compared to two live-action titles in fiscal 2018 and the carryover performance of fiscal 2016 new release titles in fiscal 2017 compared to the carryover performance of fiscal 2017 new release titles in fiscal 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the release of three Marvel titles and two Lucasfilm titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two Marvel titles and one Lucasfilm title in fiscal 2017. The increase in average net effective pricing was due to higher rates and a higher sales mix of Blu-ray discs, partially offset by a lower mix of new release titles. \n\nTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue reflected a 5% increase from TV/SVOD distribution and a 3% increase from stage plays. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to an increase in our free television business driven by \n\nnew international agreements and the sale of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in fiscal 2018 with no comparable title in fiscal 2017. Higher stage play revenue was due to the opening of additional productions in fiscal 2018. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which increase d $625 million , from $2,562 million to $3,187 million and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increase d $106 million , from $1,156 million to $1,262 million . Higher film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher theatrical distribution revenues. Higher cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to an increase in stage play production and theatrical distribution costs. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased $337 million from $2,156 million to $2,493 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal 2018 and, to a lesser extent, higher stage play marketing costs due to additional productions in fiscal 2018. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increase d 27% , or $641 million to $3,004 million due to an increase in theatrical distribution results. \n\nDirect-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\nOperating results for the Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAffiliate fees \n\n$ \n\n1,372 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,335 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nAdvertising \n\n1,311 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,293 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSubscription fees and other \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n3,414 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,075 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses \n\n(2,384 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,983 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(20 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other \n\n(1,003 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(861 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(16 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n(185 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(94 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(97 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the income of investees \n\n(580 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(421 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(38 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income \n\n$ \n\n(738 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(284 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues \n\nThe increase in affiliate fees was due to an increase of 5% from higher contractual rates, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. \n\nAdvertising revenue increase d 1% as higher addressable ad sales were largely offset by lower revenue generated from content distributed on YouTube. \n\nOther revenue increase d $284 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech.

The Company&#8217;s share of BAMTech&#8217;s results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees. The higher loss at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. \n\nSegment Operating Loss \n\nSegment operating loss increase d $454 million , to $738 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech and a higher loss from Hulu, partially offset by growth at our International Channels. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income/(loss) detail for the Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International segment to provide information on International Channels that were historically reported in the Media Networks segment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\nBetter / \n\n(Worse) \n\n(unaudited; in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nSupplemental revenue detail \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Channels \n\n$ \n\n1,920 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,853 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nDTC businesses and other \n\n1,494 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,222 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,414 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,075 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nSupplemental operating income/(loss) detail \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Channels \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\nDTC businesses and other \n\n(469 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(96 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nEquity in the loss of investees \n\n(580 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(421 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(38 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(738 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(284 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#62;(100 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEliminations \n\nIntersegment content transactions are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nYear Ended \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n(in millions) \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 30, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nBetter/ (Worse) \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStudio Entertainment: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContent transactions with Media Networks \n\n$ \n\n(169 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(137 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(23) \n\n&#160;% \n\nContent transactions with Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\n(28 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(22 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(27) \n\n&#160;% \n\nMedia Networks: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContent transactions with Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\n(471 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(454 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4) \n\n&#160;% \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n(668 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(613 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(9) \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStudio Entertainment: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContent transactions with Media Networks \n\n$ \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\nContent transactions with Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\nMedia Networks: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nContent transactions with Direct-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\nTotal \n\n$ \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nnm \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change Better/(Worse) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2019 vs. 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n2018 vs. 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(987 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(744 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(582 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(33 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n(28 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe increases in corporate and unallocated shared expenses from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 and from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 were due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of TFCF and higher compensation costs. \n\nRESTRUCTURING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF TFCF \n\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in connection with the acquisition of TFCF the Company has begun implementing a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of TFCF. During fiscal 2019, we recorded charges of $1.2 billion , including $0.9 billion of severance and related costs in connection with the plan and $0.3 billion of equity-based compensation costs, primarily for TFCF awards that were accelerated to vest upon the closing of the TFCF acquisition. These charges are recorded in &#8220;Restructuring and impairment charges&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Although our plans are not yet finalized, we anticipate that the total severance and related costs could be on the order of $1.5 billion. The Company may incur other restructuring costs, such as contract termination costs, but we expect these will not be material. For fiscal 2018, restructuring and impairment charges were not material. \n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in restructuring reserves related to TFCF integration efforts in fiscal 2019: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nBeginning \n\nBalance \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditions \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\nEnding \n\nBalance \n\nRestructuring reserves \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(230 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS \n\nIn November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based direct-to-consumer streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming in the U.S. and four other countries. Further launches are planned for Western Europe in spring 2020, Latin America in fall 2021, Eastern Europe starting in late 2020 and continuing in 2021, and various Asia-Pacific territories throughout 2020 and 2021. As we will use our branded film and television content on the Disney+ service, we expect to forgo licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets. In addition, we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for Disney+. \n\nDue to the circumstances in Hong Kong, we have seen a significant decrease in tourism from China and other parts of Asia to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. If current trends continue, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort's fiscal 2020 operating income could decrease by approximately $275 million compared to fiscal 2019. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operations - continuing operations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,984 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,295 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,343 \n\nCash used in investing activities - continuing operations \n\n&#160; \n\n(15,096 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(5,336 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,111 \n\n) \n\nCash used in financing activities - continuing operations \n\n&#160; \n\n(464 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,843 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,959 \n\n) \n\nCash provided by operations - discontinued operations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCash provided by investing activities - discontinued operations \n\n&#160; \n\n10,978 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCash used in financing activities - discontinued operations \n\n&#160; \n\n(626 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nImpact of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n\n&#160; \n\n(98 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(25 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(696 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nContinuing operations \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 decreased 58% or $8.3 billion to $6.0 billion compared to fiscal 2018 due to the payment of approximately $7.6 billion of tax obligations that arose from the spin-off of Fox Corporation in connection with the TFCF acquisition and the sale of the RSNs acquired with TFCF, higher pension plan contributions and higher interest payments. Lower operating cash flows at our DTCI and Media Networks segments were largely offset by increases at Parks, Experiences and Products and Studio Entertainment. The decreases at DTCI and Media Networks were due to higher film and television spending and operating disbursements, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. The increases at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experiences and Products were due to higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. The increase at Studio Entertainment was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. The increase at Parks, Experiences and Products was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by cost inflation and higher marketing expenses. \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased 16% or $2.0 billion to $14.3 billion compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the Tax Act, a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experiences and Products, partially offset by lower operating cash flows at Media Networks and DTCI and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in New York. The increase in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. Parks, Experiences and Products cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue, partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs. Lower operating cash flow at Media Networks was due to higher television production spending. The decrease in operating cash flow at DTCI was due to higher operating cash disbursements. \n\nDepreciation expense is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMedia Networks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCable Networks \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nBroadcasting \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Media Networks \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nParks, Experiences and Products \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDomestic \n\n&#160; \n\n1,474 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,449 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,371 \n\nInternational \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Parks, Experiences and Products \n\n&#160; \n\n2,198 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,217 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,050 \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDirect-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal depreciation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,837 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,758 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,586 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAmortization of intangible assets is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMedia Networks \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nParks, Experiences and Products \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDirect-to-Consumer &#38; International \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTFCF and Hulu \n\n&#160; \n\n1,043 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nTotal amortization of intangible assets \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,323 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and DTCI segments incur costs to acquire and produce feature film and television programming.

The increase in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort, partially offset by lower spending on new attractions at Disneyland Resort, while the increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, including Star Wars: Galaxy&#8217;s Edge. The increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending at Disneyland Paris, while the decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to lower spending at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. \n\nCapital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. \n\nCapital expenditures at DTCI primarily reflect investments in technology. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on technology to support our DTC services. \n\nCapital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was driven by investments in corporate facilities. \n\nThe Company currently expects its fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.5 billion higher than fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of $4.9 billion due to increased spending on technology and facilities at DTCI and Corporate. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nThe fiscal 2019 spending of $9.9 billion on acquisitions reflects $35.7 billion of cash paid to acquire TFCF less $25.7 billion of cash acquired in the transaction (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash used in other investing activities of $319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of $347 million to Hulu prior to the consolidation of Hulu. \n\nThe fiscal 2018 spending of $1.6 billion on acquisitions was for the September 2017 acquisition of an additional 42% of BAMTech. Cash provided by other investing activities of $710 million in fiscal 2018 reflected $1.2 billion of cash received in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights, partially offset by contributions of $442 million to Hulu. \n\nThe fiscal 2017 spending of $417 million on acquisitions was for the January 2017 acquisition of additional interests in BAMTech net of cash assumed upon the consolidation of BAMTech. Cash used in other investing activities of $71 million in fiscal 2017 reflected $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions. \n\nDiscontinued operations \n\nCash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the RSNs. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nContinuing operations \n\nCash used in financing activities was $ 0.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $ 8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 . The net use of cash in the current year was due to $2.9 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from borrowing of $3.7 billion . The decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to a net increase in borrowings in the current year compared to net repayments in the prior year ($3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018) and the absence of common stock repurchases in the current year (compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2018), partially offset by acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in the current year ($1.4 billion in fiscal 2019). \n\nCash used in financing activities was $ 8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017 . The net use of cash in fiscal 2018 was due to $3.6 billion of common stock repurchases, $2.5 billion in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of $2.6 billion . Cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 as lower common stock repurchases ( $3.6 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.4 billion in fiscal 2017 ) and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.4 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2018 compared to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2017 ( $2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018 compared to $3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2017 ). \n\nDiscontinued operations \n\nCash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the RSNs. \n\nBorrowings activities and other \n\nDuring the year ended September 28, 2019 , the Company&#8217;s borrowing activity was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 29, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nBorrowings \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments \n\n&#160; \n\nBorrowings Assumed in Acquisition of TFCF \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\nActivity \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 \n\nCommercial paper with original maturities less than three months (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,881 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,934 \n\nCommercial paper with original maturities greater than three months \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6,889 \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,452 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,408 \n\nU.S. dollar denominated notes \n\n&#160; \n\n18,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,930 \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,044 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n21,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n39,424 \n\nAsia Theme Parks borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n1,145 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(47 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,114 \n\nForeign currency denominated debt and other (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(690 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,106 \n\nCredit facilities to acquire TFCF \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n31,100 \n\n&#160; \n\n(31,100 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n20,874 \n\n&#160; \n\n47,010 \n\n&#160; \n\n(43,333 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n21,723 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n46,986 \n\nLiabilities held for sale (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(68 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n1,069 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,051 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,874 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n47,060 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(43,401 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,792 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(339 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n46,986 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nBorrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nThe other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nThe other activity is due to the sale of the RSNs in fiscal 2019. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#8217;s bank facilities. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. \n\nSee Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company&#8217;s dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . \n\nWe believe that the Company&#8217;s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company&#8217;s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company&#8217;s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company&#8217;s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of \n\nSeptember 28, 2019 , Moody&#8217;s Investors Service&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, Standard and Poor&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, and Fitch&#8217;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F1, respectively. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 28, 2019 , by a significant margin. The Company&#8217;s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nThe Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 28, 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than \n\n1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1-3 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\n4-5 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than \n\n5 Years \n\nBorrowings (Note 9) (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n65,888 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,398 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,021 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,516 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,953 \n\nOperating lease commitments (Note 15) \n\n&#160; \n\n5,931 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,519 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,491 \n\nCapital lease obligations (Note 15) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSports programming commitments (Note 15) \n\n&#160; \n\n43,940 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,878 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,613 \n\n&#160; \n\n9,315 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,134 \n\nBroadcast programming commitments (Note 15) \n\n&#160; \n\n6,474 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,599 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,277 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sports and other broadcast programming commitments \n\n&#160; \n\n50,414 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,477 \n\n&#160; \n\n17,890 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,261 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,786 \n\nOther (2) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,210 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,218 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,198 \n\nTotal contractual obligations (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n135,700 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,086 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n32,761 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,967 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n56,886 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nExcludes market value adjustments, which reduce recorded borrowings by $31 million .

For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFilm and Television Revenues and Costs \n\nWe produce films and television series for distribution in the theatrical and television markets and on our DTC streaming services. We expense the production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period&#8217;s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. \n\nWith respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g. the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film&#8217;s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company&#8217;s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. \n\nWith respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company&#8217;s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, SVOD services and in home entertainment formats. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. \n\nWe expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on an accelerated or straight-line basis over the useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program&#8217;s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season&#8217;s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. \n\nWe also acquire, license and produce films and television series for our direct-to-consumer streaming platforms. We expense these costs based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, which may be on an accelerated or straight-line basis, as appropriate. \n\nCosts of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company&#8217;s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. \n\nEstimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. \n\nFor film and television series that are exploited on our direct-to-consumer streaming services, the unamortized costs are reviewed for impairment on an aggregate basis for each service. \n\nFixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and motion picture productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee. TV/SVOD distribution contracts may contain more than one title and/or provide that certain titles are only available for use during defined periods of time during the contract term. In these instances, each title and/or period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation. For these contracts, license fees are allocated to each title and period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using management's best estimate. Estimates used to determine a performance obligation's standalone selling price impact the timing of revenue recognition, but not the total revenue to be recognized under the arrangements. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. We have updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. \n\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We reduced our discount rate to 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 from 4.31% at the end of fiscal 2018 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2019 year-end measurement date. The Company&#8217;s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans&#8217; liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $313 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 28, 2019 by approximately $3.6 billion . A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $273 million and $3.0 billion , respectively. \n\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.25% . A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $157 million . \n\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments \n\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company&#8217;s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. In addition, the projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. \n\nThe Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. \n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group&#8217;s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group&#8217;s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset&#8217;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. \n\nThe Company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment. The impairment charges recorded for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material. \n\nFor fiscal 2019, the fair value of our International Channels reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by less than 10%. Our International Channels reporting unit comprises the Company&#8217;s international cable networks that provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs. A majority of the operations in this reporting unit consist of businesses acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value approximates carrying value. Goodwill of this reporting unit is approximately $3 billion. Changes to key assumptions, market trends, or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record an impairment charge. \n\nThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. \n\nThe Company tested its investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $538 million and $210 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in &#8220;Equity in the income (loss) of investees, net&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fiscal 2017 impairment charges recorded were not material. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nWe evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. \n\nContingencies and Litigation \n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. \n\nIncome Tax Audits \n\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. The acquisition of TFCF increased the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax benefits as the Company assumed the tax liabilities of TFCF. The Company is still obtaining information related to the evaluation of the \n\nincome tax impact of certain pre-acquisition transactions of TFCF which may result in adjustments to the recorded amount of uncertain tax benefits. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company&#8217;s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company&#8217;s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are &#8220;forward-looking,&#8221; including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management&#8217;s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business. \n\n"}
