The decrease is primarily due to lower pension expense, lower sales as a result of the factors discussed within the Review of Business Segments section of this MD&#38;A, lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work scheduled reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our Business Segments, and lower repositioning charges. \n\nGross margin percentage increased by 7.4 percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower pension expense, increases of 2.9 and 0.6 percent, respectively, in our Specialty Materials and Automation &#38; Controls Solutions segments, as a result of the cost savings initiatives discussed above, and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by lower margins in our Transportation Systems and Aerospace Solutions segments of 3.2 and 0.7 percent, respectively, due to lower sales partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,717 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,443 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,130 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n14.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n14.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A) decreased as a percentage of sales by 0.3 percent in 2010 compared to the 2009 driven by the impact of higher sales volume, discussed above, and lower pension expense, partially offset by an estimated $500 million increase in labor costs (reflecting the absence of prior period labor cost actions). \n\nSG&#38;A as a percentage of sales increased by 0.4 of a percentage point in 2009 compared with 2008.

The foreign effective tax rate increased by approximately 7 percentage points which primarily consisted of i) a 6 percentage point impact from the absence of tax benefits related to foreign exchange and investment losses and ii) a 0.5 percentage points impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating loss. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. \n\nThe effective tax rate increased by 60.4 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings related to lower U.S. pension expense and to a lesser extent, a decreased impact from the settlement of audits. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings taxed at lower foreign rates. \n\nIn 2011, the effective tax rate could change based upon the Company&#146;s operating results and the outcome of tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns currently under audit by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities, several of which may be finalized in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has adequate reserves for these matters, the outcome of which could materially impact the results of operations and operating cash flows in the period they are resolved. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nNet income attributable to Honeywell \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,548 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings per share of common stock &#150; assuming dilution \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.59 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.05 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.08 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stock &#150; assuming dilution increased by $0.54 per share in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to increased segment profit in our Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems segments and lower pension expense, partially offset by higher tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges. \n\nEarnings per share of common stock &#150; assuming dilution increased by $0.97 per share in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily relates to lower pension expense and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by a decrease in segment profit in each of our business segments, decreased Other (Income) Expense, as discussed above, and an increase in the number of shares outstanding. \n\nFor further discussion of segment results, see &#147;Review of Business Segments&#148;. \n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW \n\nThis Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2011 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segment&#146;s results for the three years ended December 31, 2010.

\n\n&#149; \n\nAir transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 2 percent in 2010 primarily due to lower sales to our air transport OE customers. \n\n##TABLE_END 30 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAir transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 1 percent for 2010 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts driven by the impact of increased flying hours of approximately 6 percent in 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nBusiness and general aviation OE sales decreased by 27 percent in 2010 due to decreases in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers in the first six months and the impact of the OEM Payments discussed above. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nBusiness and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts due to higher engine utilization, partially offset by lower revenue associated with licensing and maintenance service agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nDefense and space sales increased by 1 percent in 2010 primarily due to higher sales of logistics services partially offset by program wind-downs and completions and lower sales related to commercial helicopters. Changes in defense and space budgets and program delays are anticipated to impact the amount and timing of sales in this end-market in 2011. \n\n##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 3 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to a negative 3 percent impact from the OEM payments, discussed above. Operational segment profit was flat in 2010 with the approximate positive 4 percent impact from price and productivity, net of inflation (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions offset by the benefits from prior repositioning actions) offset by an approximate negative 4 percent impact from lower sales volume. Cost of goods sold totaled $8.1 billion in 2010, unchanged from 2009. \n\n2009 compared with 2008 \n\nAerospace sales decreased by 15 percent in 2009. Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAir transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009. The decrease is driven by lower sales to our OE customers, consistent with production rates and platform mix, and the impact of divesting our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly due to the absence of a strike at a major OEM in the fourth quarter of 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAir transport and regional aftermarket sales decreased by 16 percent in 2009 primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower maintenance activity driven by the impact of higher parked aircraft part utilization, customer inventory reductions initiatives and decreased flying hours of approximately 2 percent, including a 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nBusiness and general aviation OE sales decreased by 51 percent in 2009 due to the decreases in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nBusiness and general aviation aftermarket sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower revenue associated with maintenance service agreements, consistent with the decrease in business jet utilization. We started to see an increase in business jet utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nDefense and space sales were essentially unchanged in 2009, primarily due to higher sales of logistics services and original equipment for military platforms in the first nine months of 2009 offset by program completions. \n\n##TABLE_END Aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices. \n\n2011 Areas of Focus \n\nAerospace&#146;s primary areas of focus for 2011 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAligning inventory, production and research and development with improving customer demand and production schedules; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nExpanding sales and operations in international locations; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nGlobal pursuit of new defense and space programs; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nFocus on cost structure initiatives to maintain profitability in face of evolving defense and space budgets and program specific appropriations; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinuing to design equipment that enhances the safety, performance and durability of aerospace and defense equipment, while reducing weight and operating costs; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nDelivering world-class customer service and achieving cycle and lead time reduction to improve responsiveness to customer demand; and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinued deployment of our common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. \n\n##TABLE_END Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) \n\n&#160; Overview \n\nACS provides innovative products and solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable.

\n\n&#149; \n\nSales in our Products businesses increased by 11 percent in 2010 primarily reflecting higher sales volumes in our businesses tied to industrial production (environmental and combustion controls, sensing and control, gas detection, personal protective equipment and scanning and mobility products), new product introductions and acquisitions, primarily Sperian. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nSales in our Solutions businesses increased by 6 percent in 2010 primarily due to the positive impact of increased volume, acquisitions, net of divestitures (primarily the RMG Group), net of divestitures, higher prices and growth in energy efficiency projects and industrial field solutions driven by orders growth and conversion to sales from order backlog. Orders and backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily driven by energy efficiency projects, refining and natural gas infrastructure projects and growth in emerging regions. \n\n##TABLE_END ACS segment profit increased by 11 percent in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a 9 percent increase in operational segment profit and 2 percent increase from acquisitions. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of an approximate 18 percent positive impact from higher sales volume, partially offset by an approximate 9 percent negative impact from inflation, net of price and productivity (including the absence of prior period labor cost actions, partially offset by the benefits of prior repositioning). Cost of goods sold totaled $9.3 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $750 million which is primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. \n\n2009 compared with 2008 \n\nACS sales decreased by 10 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decreased sales volume (reflecting slower global economic growth) and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4 percent, partially offset by a 3 percent growth from acquisitions. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nSales in our Products businesses decreased by 11 percent, including (i) lower volumes of sales in each of our businesses (excluding the impact of acquisitions) and (ii) the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.

Higher backlog is primarily due to longer duration projects. The impact of these factors was partially offset by the positive impact of acquisitions, most significantly the RMG Group. \n\n##TABLE_END ACS segment profit decreased by 2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the negative impact of lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors more than offset the impact of lower sales described above resulting in a 5 percent increase in segment profit. \n\n2011 Areas of Focus \n\nACS&#146;s primary areas of focus for 2011 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nProducts and solutions for energy efficiency and asset management; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nExtending technology leadership: lowest total installed cost and integrated product solutions; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nDefending and extending our installed base through customer productivity and globalization; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nSustaining strong brand recognition through our brand and channel management; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinued centralization and standardization of global software development capabilities; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinuing to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions in or adjacent to the markets which we serve; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinuing to establish and grow emerging markets presence and capability; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinuing to invest in new product development and introductions; and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nContinued deployment of our common ERP system. \n\n##TABLE_END Specialty Materials \n\nOverview \n\nSpecialty Materials develops and manufactures high-purity, high-quality and high-performance chemicals and materials for applications in the refining, petrochemical, automotive, healthcare, agricultural, packaging, refrigeration, appliance, housing, semiconductor, wax and adhesives segments.

\n\n&#149; \n\nTurbo Technologies sales increased 31 percent primarily due to increased turbocharger sales to both light vehicle and commercial vehicle engine manufacturers partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign exchange. We expect increased volume to continue in 2011 as we benefit from new platform launches and continued strong diesel penetration rates in Western Europe. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nConsumer Products Group (&#147;CPG&#148;) sales increased 7 percent, primarily due to higher prices (primarily pass through of ethylene glycol cost increases) and higher volume of antifreeze products in the fourth quarter. \n\n##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit increased by $317 million in 2010 compared with 2009 predominantly due to the positive impact from increased sales volume. Cost of goods sold totaled $3.4 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately $500 million which is also primarily a result of increased sales volume. \n\n2009 compared with 2008 \n\nTransportation Systems sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009 compared with the 2008, primarily due to lower volumes (driven by the ongoing challenging global automotive industry conditions) and the negative impact of foreign exchange in the first nine months of 2009. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nTurbo Technologies sales, including Friction Materials, decreased by 32 percent primarily due to lower sales volumes to both our commercial and light vehicle engine manufacturing customers and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Diesel penetration rates in Western Europe declined in the first nine months of 2009 and there was a shift in consumer preference towards lower displacement engines. Full year 2009 sales decline was partially offset by a 19 percent sales increase during the fourth quarter primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange and higher sales volumes to our light vehicle engine manufacturing customers. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nCPG sales decreased by 8 percent primarily due to lower prices (primarily pass through of ethylene glycol cost decreases), lower volumes, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. \n\n##TABLE_END Transportation Systems segment profit decreased by $ 250 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due principally to lower sales volume as a result of the factors discussed above partially offset by lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation) and the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives. In the fourth \n\nquarter of 2009 these factors and increased Turbo Technologies volumes resulted in a $66 million increase in Transportation Systems&#146; segment profit. \n\n2011 Areas of Focus \n\nTransportation Systems primary areas of focus in 2011 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nSustaining superior turbocharger technology through successful platform launches; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nMaintaining the high quality of current products while executing new product introductions; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nIncreasing global penetration and share of diesel and gasoline turbocharger OEM demand; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nIncreasing plant productivity to address capacity challenges generated by volatility in product demand and OEM inventory levels; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAligning cost structure with current economic outlook, and successful execution of repositioning actions; and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAligning development efforts and costs with new turbo platform launch schedules. \n\n##TABLE_END Repositioning and Other Charges \n\nSee Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of repositioning and other charges incurred in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $200 million in 2011 compared with 2010 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $151, $200, and $157 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate a total of $150 million in 2011 and will be funded through operating cash flows. \n\nThe following tables provide details of the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;

Considering the current economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and our business plans and strategies, including our focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity \n\ninitiatives, we believe that our cash balances and operating cash flows will remain our principal source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables. \n\nA source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing potential acquisitions. There was $299 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010. \n\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2010, Standard and Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P), Fitch, and Moody&#146;s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. S&#38;P, Fitch and Moody&#8217;s have Honeywell&#146;s rating outlook as &#147;stable&#148;. To date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We maintain a $2.8 billion committed bank revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper, which expires in mid-May 2012. At December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued under the credit facility. The credit facility does not restrict Honeywell&#146;s ability to pay dividends, nor does it contain financial covenants. We expect to refinance the credit facility in 2011. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2010, the Company repaid $1,000 million of its 7.50% notes. The repayment was funded with cash provided by operating activities. \n\nIn October 2010, we completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding shares of Sperian Protection (Sperian), a French company that operates globally in the personal protection equipment design and manufacturing industry. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was approximately $1,475 million, including the assumption of approximately $326 million of outstanding debt. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n\nAs a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable program permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Company&#146;s balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as either Short-term borrowings or Long-term debt. \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. \n\nGlobal economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers&#146; or suppliers&#146; ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. \n\nSpecifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2011 to be as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nCapital expenditures&#151;we expect to spend approximately $800 million for capital expenditures in 2011 primarily for cost reduction, maintenance, replacement, growth, and production and capacity expansion. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nDebt repayments&#151;there are $523 million of scheduled long-term debt maturities in 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nShare repurchases&#151;The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $3 billion of Honeywell common stock, which amount includes $1.3 billion that remained available under the Company&#146;s previously reported share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2011 to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nDividends&#151;we expect to pay approximately $1,050 million in dividends on our common stock in 2011, reflecting a 1 percent increase in the number of shares outstanding and a 10 percent increase in the 2011 dividend rate. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nAsbestos claims&#151;we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $162 and $50 million, respectively, in 2011. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for further discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nPension contributions&#151;In 2011, we are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements. However, in January 2011 we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of the plans. During 2010, we made voluntary contributions of $600 million in cash and $400 million of Honeywell common stock to our U.S. pension plans, as well as $242 million of marketable securities to our non-U.S. pension plans, to improve the funded status of our plans. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension contributions. In addition, the Company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011 and currently expects to contribute a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its Consumer Products Group business (discussed below) to our U.S. Pension plans. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nRepositioning actions&#151;we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the previously announced repositioning actions will approximate $150 million in 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nEnvironmental remediation costs&#151;we expect to spend approximately $325 million in 2011 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2008 we realized $909 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. \n\nIn January 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Consumer Products Group business (CPG) to Rank Group Limited for approximately $950 million. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2011. We currently estimate that the transaction will result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $350 million, approximately $200 million net of tax. The sale of CPG, within the Transportation Systems segment, is consistent with the Company&#146;s strategic focus on its portfolio of differentiated global technologies. \n\nIn July 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Consumables Solutions business to B/E Aerospace (&#147;B/E&#148;) for $1.05 billion, consisting of approximately $901 million in cash and six million shares of B/E common stock. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, this transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $623 million, $417 million net of tax. These proceeds, along with our other sources and uses of liquidity, as discussed above, were utilized to invest in our existing core businesses and fund acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Based on our current financial position and expected economic performance. \n\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2010: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments by Period \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal(6) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012- 2013 \n\n&#160; \n\n2014- 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nLong-term debt, including capitalized leases (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,278 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,125 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,844 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,804 \n\n&#160; \n\nMinimum operating lease payments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,353 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase obligations (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,856 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimated environmental liability payments (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsbestos related liability payments (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,719 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsbestos insurance recoveries (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(875 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(50 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(133 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(176 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(516 \n\n) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,928 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,515 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,496 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,677 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,240 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1) \n\nAssumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2) \n\nPurchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3) \n\nThe payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2010. See Environmental Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4) \n\nThese amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2010. NARCO estimated payments are based on the terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, specified in the definitive agreements or agreements in principle and pursuant to Trust Distribution Procedures. Projecting the timing of NARCO payments is dependent on, among other things, the effective date of the Trust which could cause the timing of payments to be earlier or later than that projected. Bendix payments are based on our estimate of pending and future claims. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5) \n\nThese amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2010. The timing of insurance recoveries are impacted by the terms of insurance settlement agreements, as well as the documentation, review and collection process required to collect on insurance claims. Where probable insurance recoveries are not subject to definitive settlement agreements with specified payment dates, but instead are covered by insurance policies, we have assumed collection will occur beyond 2015. Projecting the timing of insurance recoveries is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the amounts collected to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded or could cause the timing of collections to be earlier or later than that projected. We reevaluate our projections concerning insurance recoveries in light of any changes or developments that would impact recoveries or the timing thereof. See Asbestos Matters in Note 21 to the financial statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END 43 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(6) \n\nThe table excludes $757 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 to the financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThe table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. In January 2011, we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. In addition, the company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011. We also expect to make contributions to our non-U.S. plans of approximately $55 million in 2011. Beyond 2011, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $188 million in 2011 net of the benefit of approximately $13 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. \n\n##TABLE_END Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nFollowing is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\nGuarantees &#151;We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2010: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMaximum Potential Future Payments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nOperating lease residual values \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nOther third parties&#146; financing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconsolidated affiliates&#146; financing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCustomer financing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\nIn connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. \n\nWith respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the \n\nuncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. \n\nRemedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $266, $318 and $320 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 , respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $325 million in 2011. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. \n\nRemedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $225, $151 and $466 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 , respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $753 and $779 million, respectively. In addition, in 2010 and 2009 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $86 and $73 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nAlthough we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. \n\nSee Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nAs a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements. \n\nWe conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and Swedish krona. \n\nOur exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Notes 14 and 16 to the financial statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. \n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2010 and 2009. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFace or Notional Amount \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying Value (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2010 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,278 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(6,278 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(6,835 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(399 \n\n) \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(18 \n\n) \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,733 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommodity Price Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForward commodity contracts (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\nDecember 31, 2009 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,264 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(7,264 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(7,677 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(421 \n\n) \n\nInterest rate swap agreements \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(23 \n\n) \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency exchange contracts (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,959 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommodity Price Sensitive Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForward commodity contracts (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(10 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n(1) \n\nAsset or (liability). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2) \n\nChanges in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3) \n\nChanges in the fair value of forward commodity contracts are offset by changes in the cash flows of underlying hedged commodity transactions. \n\n##TABLE_END The above discussion of our procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from our sensitivity analyses are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2010 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 to the financial statements. \n\n&#160; Contingent Liabilities &#151;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including management&#146;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements. \n\nAsbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries &#151;We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions, including evidentiary requirements, in definitive agreements or agreements in principle with current claimants. We also accrued for the probable value of future NARCO asbestos related claims through 2018 based on the disease criteria and payment values contained in the NARCO trust as described in Note 21 to the financial statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections regarding claims filing rates and disease manifestation, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims based on expected claim resolution values and historic dismissal rates. We also accrued for the estimated cost of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on our assessment of additional claims that may be brought against us and anticipated resolution values in the tort system. We value Bendix pending and future claims using the average resolution values for the previous five years. We will continue to update the expected resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 21 to the financial statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical experience with our insurers, our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers, various judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements with our insurers. At December 31, 2010, we have recorded insurance receivables of $718 million that can be specifically allocated to NARCO related asbestos liabilities. We also have $1.9 billion in coverage remaining for Bendix related asbestos liabilities although there are gaps in our coverage due to insurance company insolvencies, certain uninsured periods and insurance settlements. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of \n\nprobable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#151; We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. \n\nIn 2010, we elected to change our method of recognizing pension expense. Previously, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we used the market-related value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a three-year period. Further, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans&#146; projected benefit obligation (the corridor) were recognized over a six-year period. Under our new accounting method which we adopted in 2010, we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). This new accounting method results in faster recognition of net actuarial gains and losses than our previous amortization method. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets. This accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM adjustments. MTM adjustments were $471, $741 and $3,290 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, will be recorded on a quarterly basis (On-going Pension Expense). See Note 1 to the financial statements for further details of the change and the impact of our retrospective application of the new policy. \n\nFor financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historic and expected plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations (see Note 22 to the financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Further information on all our major actuarial assumptions is included in Note 22 to the financial statements. \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our 2010, 2009 and 2008 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\nDiscount rate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.95 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.50 \n\n% \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected rate of return \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nActual rate of return \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(29 \n\n%) \n\nActual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 5.25 percent discount rate in 2011, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2009. We will use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8 percent for 2011 down from 9 percent in 2010 due to lower future expected market returns. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future on-going pension expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and on-going expense to changes in these \n\nassumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in Assumption \n\n&#160; \n\nImpact on 2011 On-Going Pension Expense \n\n&#160; \n\nImpact on PBO \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate \n\n&#160; \n\nDecrease $8 million \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease $390 million \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease $6 million \n\n&#160; \n\nDecrease $380 million \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease $30 million \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; \n\nDecrease $30 million \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END On-going pension expense for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $110 million in 2011, a decrease of $79 million from 2010, due primarily to a voluntary contribution of $1 billion in cash to our U.S. pension plans in January 2011 and strong 2010 asset returns. Also, if required, an MTM adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 in accordance with our new pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM adjustment in 2011, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nIn 2010, 2009 and 2008, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans. However, we made voluntary contributions of $1,000, $740 and $242 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008 , respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which had deteriorated during 2008 due to the significant asset losses resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. In 2011, we are still not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements. However, in January 2011 we made a voluntary cash contribution of $1 billion to our U.S. plans to improve the funded status of our plans. In addition, the Company is evaluating additional voluntary contributions in 2011. The timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate. We also expect to contribute approximately $55 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2011 to satisfy regulatory funding standards. \n\nLong-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets) &#151;To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2010, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled $7.0 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nsignificant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nannual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends; and \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#149; \n\nsignificant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 in the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future \n\ndiscounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 to the financial statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $30 and $28 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, principally related to manufacturing plant and equipment in facilities scheduled to close or be downsized. \n\nGoodwill Impairment Testing &#151;Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. Our Goodwill balance, $11.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 , is subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. \n\nWe completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2010 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units. \n\nIncome Taxes &#151; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. \n\nAs of December 31, 2010, we recognized a net deferred tax asset of $2,015 million, less a valuation allowance of $636 million. Net deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. \n\nOur net deferred tax asset of $2,015 million consists of $1,254 million related to U.S. operations and $761 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $1,254 million consists of net deductible temporary differences, tax credit carryforwards, federal and state tax net operating losses which we believe will more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income in the U.S. and tax planning strategies. We maintain a valuation allowance of $3 million against such asset related to state net operating losses. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $761 million consists principally of net operating and capital loss carryforwards, mainly in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany. We maintain a valuation allowance of $634 million against these deferred tax assets reflecting our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $58 million in 2010 and increased by $133 million and decreased by $45 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, as defined by the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon \n\nexamination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#151;In 2010, we recognized approximately 14 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Specialty Materials segments. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 21 to the financial statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters . \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n"}
