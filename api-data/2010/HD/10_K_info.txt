Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data \n\nFor fiscal year ended January 30, 2011 (&#147;fiscal 2010&#148;), we reported Net Earnings of $3.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.01 compared to Net Earnings of $2.7 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.57 for fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 (&#147;fiscal 2009&#148;). \n\nThe results for fiscal 2010 included a $51 million pretax charge related to the extension of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of HD Supply, Inc. (the &#147;HD Supply Guarantee Extension&#148;). The results for fiscal 2009 reflected the impact of several strategic actions initiated in fiscal 2008. These strategic actions resulted in store rationalization charges related to the closing of 15 underperforming U.S. stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store pipeline, business rationalization charges related to the exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses (the &#147;Exited Businesses&#148;) and charges related to the restructuring of support functions (collectively, the &#147;Rationalization Charges&#148;). These actions resulted in pretax Rationalization Charges of $146 million for fiscal 2009. The results for fiscal 2009 also included a pretax charge of $163 million to write-down our investment in HD Supply, Inc. Additionally, fiscal 2009 included earnings of $41 million from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. \n\nWe reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $3.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $2.01 for fiscal 2010 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.6 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.55 for fiscal 2009. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, and the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply from our fiscal 2009 results, Earnings from Continuing Operations were $3.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.03 for fiscal 2010 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.66 for fiscal 2009. \n\nNet Sales increased 2.8% to $68.0 billion for fiscal 2010 from $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009. Our comparable store sales increased 2.9% in fiscal 2010, driven by a 2.4% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket to $51.93. Comparable store sales for our U.S. stores increased 2.5% in fiscal 2010. \n\nIn fiscal 2010, we focused on the following four key initiatives: \n\nCustomer Service &#150; Our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of taking care of our associates, putting customers first and simplifying the business. The roll out of our Customers FIRST training to all store associates and support staff in fiscal 2009 has brought simplification and focus across the business, and we repeated and refreshed the Customers FIRST training during fiscal 2010. The Customers FIRST program is part of our ongoing commitment to improve customer service levels in our stores, and we continued to see the benefit of this training in improved customer service ratings for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Also in fiscal 2010, we completed the deployment of our FIRST Phone, a new hand held device that provides multiple functions such as inventory management, product location and mobile checkout. The core purpose of this new device is to reduce tasking time for our store associates to allow them more time to focus on customer service. We ended fiscal 2010 with more than half of our store payroll allocated to customer facing activities rather than tasking activities. We have a customer facing store payroll target of 60%, and we believe we will achieve that by 2013. \n\nProduct Authority &#150; Our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, including innovation, assortment and value. In fiscal 2010, we made significant progress on our merchandising tools in the U.S. that helped us manage markdown and clearance activity and better control inventory. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.13 times at the end of fiscal 2010 compared to 4.06 times at the end of fiscal 2009. Additionally, we continued to form strategic alliances and relationships with selected suppliers to bring a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments. \n\n&#160; \n\nProductivity and Efficiency &#150; Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency starts with disciplined capital allocation focused on building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of fiscal 2010, we completed the roll out of our Rapid Deployment Centers (&#147;RDCs&#148;) and now have 19 RDCs that serve 100% of our U.S. stores. Also during fiscal 2010, we repurchased 80.9 million shares for $2.6 billion, and on February 22, 2011 we announced a six percent increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 25 cents per share. \n\nInterconnected Retail &#150; Our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success. Our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise, and we are making the investment to build these capabilities, including the roll out of &#147;buy on-line, pick-up in store&#148; next year. We are committed to having a best-in-class website, and during fiscal 2010 our site was named as a Most Improved Website for customer satisfaction by Foresee, a leading customer satisfaction analytics firm. \n\nWe opened eight new stores in fiscal 2010, including one relocation, and closed three stores, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2010 to 2,248. As of the end of fiscal 2010, a total of 272 of these stores, or 12.1%, were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 268 stores, or 11.9%, at the end of fiscal 2009. \n\nWe generated approximately $4.6 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010. We used this cash flow along with cash on hand to fund $2.6 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.6 billion of dividends and fund $1.1 billion in capital expenditures. \n\nAt the end of fiscal 2010, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 46.1% compared to 44.7% at the end of fiscal 2009. Our return on invested capital for continuing operations (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 12.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 10.7% for fiscal 2009. This increase reflects the impact of the Rationalization Charges which were included in our operating profit for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 12.7% for fiscal 2010 compared to 11.1% for fiscal 2009. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; % of Net Sales &#160; &#160; % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; 2009 &#160; &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; 2010 vs. 2009 &#160; &#160; 2009 vs. 2008 &#160; NET SALES \n\n&#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 2.8 % &#160; &#160; (7.2 )% Gross Profit \n\n&#160; &#160; 34.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6.6 ) Operating Expenses: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Selling, General and Administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 23.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; (0.3 ) &#160; &#160; (10.9 ) Depreciation and Amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5.3 ) &#160; &#160; (4.4 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Operating Expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; 25.7 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; (0.8 ) &#160; &#160; (10.3 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; OPERATING INCOME \n\n&#160; &#160; 8.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 21.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10.2 &#160; Interest and Other (Income) Expense: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest and Investment Income \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; (16.7 ) &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; Interest Expense \n\n&#160; &#160; 0.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; (21.6 ) &#160; &#160; 8.3 &#160; Other \n\n&#160; &#160; 0.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; (68.7 ) &#160; &#160; 0.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest and Other, net \n\n&#160; &#160; 0.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; (31.1 ) &#160; &#160; 6.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES \n\n&#160; &#160; 7.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32.4 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10.9 &#160; Provision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 42.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; &#160; 4.9 % &#160; &#160; 4.0 % &#160; &#160; 3.2 % &#160; &#160; 27.4 % &#160; &#160; 13.3 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; SELECTED SALES DATA \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Customer Transactions (in millions) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,306 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,274 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,272 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.5 % &#160; &#160; 0.2 % Average Ticket \n\n&#160; $ 51.93 &#160; &#160; $ 51.76 &#160; &#160; $ 55.61 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.3 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6.9 ) Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands) \n\n&#160; $ 581 &#160; &#160; $ 563 &#160; &#160; $ 601 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6.3 ) Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot \n\n&#160; $ 288.64 &#160; &#160; $ 278.97 &#160; &#160; $ 298.19 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; (6.4 ) Comparable Store Sales Increase (Decrease) (%) (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2.9 % &#160; &#160; (6.6 )% &#160; &#160; (8.7 )% &#160; &#160; N/A &#160; &#160; &#160; N/A &#160; ##TABLE_END Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 refer to the fiscal years ended January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively.

Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365 th day of operation. Comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for Net Sales or Net Earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\n##TABLE_END N/A &#150; Not Applicable \n\n&#160; \n\nResults of Operations \n\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. \n\nFiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet Sales for fiscal 2010 increased 2.8% to $68.0 billion from $66.2 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales increased 2.9% for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 6.6% for fiscal 2009. \n\nThe increase in comparable store sales for fiscal 2010 reflects a number of factors. We experienced positive comparable store sales in 11 of our 13 departments for fiscal 2010. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Tools, Electrical, Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden and Kitchen/Bath product categories were above the Company average for fiscal 2010. The increase in comparable store sales also reflects a 2.4% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket to $51.93. \n\nWe believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. We estimate our share of the U.S. home improvement market is approximately 26% using the U.S. Census Bureau&#146;s North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, 4441 classification for building material and supplies dealers. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross Profit increased 4.0% to $23.3 billion for fiscal 2010 from $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 34.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 33.9% for fiscal 2009, an increase of 40 basis points. Our U.S. stores experienced gross profit margin expansion in fiscal 2010 as we realized benefits from better product assortment management through our portfolio approach and leveraging of our newly developed merchandising tools. Lower levels of clearance inventory in our stores for fiscal 2010 compared to last year also contributed to this expansion. Additionally, we realized gross profit margin expansion from our non-U.S. businesses, primarily Canada, due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses (&#147;SG&#38;A&#148;) decreased 0.3% to $15.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#38;A was 23.3% for fiscal 2010 compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2010 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and lower payroll and other expenses. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization decreased 5.3% to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2010 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.4% for fiscal 2010 compared to 2.6% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to a smaller depreciable fixed asset base compared to last year, arising from fully depreciated assets. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating Income increased 21.6% to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 from $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 8.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 7.3% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the Rationalization Charges from the results of fiscal 2009, Operating Income increased 18.0% for fiscal 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nIn fiscal 2010, we recognized $566 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $821 million for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.2% for fiscal 2009. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $51 million charge in fiscal 2010 related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension and a $163 million charge in fiscal 2009 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2010 compared to 1.0% for fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $44 million benefit arising from favorable IRS guidance resulting in the reversal of an interest accrual during fiscal 2010, a lower cost of outstanding indebtedness than last year and an interest benefit arising from certain state income tax settlements. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations increased to 36.7% for fiscal 2010 from 34.2% for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 included benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure. \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.01 for fiscal 2010 and $1.55 for fiscal 2009. Excluding the HD Supply Guarantee Extension charge from our fiscal 2010 results, and the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply from our fiscal 2009 results, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 were $2.03 compared to $1.66 for fiscal 2009, an increase of 22.3%. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2010 reflect $0.04 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nOn August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. \n\nNon-GAAP Measures \n\nTo provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we supplement our reporting with non-GAAP financial measures to reflect adjustments for the $51 million pretax charge related to the HD Supply Guarantee Extension as described more fully in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Rationalization Charges as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Net Sales from Exited Businesses during the period from closing announcement to actual closing, and the charges to write-down our investment in HD Supply of $163 million in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 as described more fully in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions, except per share data): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2009 (&#147;fiscal 2008&#148;) \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet Sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 7.2% to $66.2 billion from $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales as well as the net impact of fewer open stores in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. Total comparable store sales decreased 6.6% for fiscal 2009 compared to a decrease of 8.7% for fiscal 2008. \n\nThere were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction, housing and home improvement markets continued to be soft, and consumers were challenged due to a number of factors including higher unemployment. We saw relative strength in our Building Materials, Flooring, Paint, Plumbing and Garden/Seasonal product categories as comparable store sales in these areas were above the Company average for fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales for our Lumber, Hardware, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork product categories were below the Company average for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we also saw significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all currencies. Fluctuating exchange rates negatively impacted our total Company sales by approximately $565 million for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. \n\nGross Profit \n\nGross Profit decreased 6.6% to $22.4 billion for fiscal 2009 from $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 33.7% for fiscal 2008, an increase of 22 basis points. Through our focused bay portfolio approach, our U.S. merchants continued to introduce new lower prices while growing overall gross margin. Additionally, gross margin expansion for fiscal 2009 was driven by lower markdowns as compared to fiscal 2008. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nSG&#38;A decreased 10.9% to $15.9 billion for fiscal 2009 from $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#38;A was 24.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 25.0% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization \n\n&#160; \n\nCharges, SG&#38;A as a percent of Net Sales was 23.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 23.7% for fiscal 2008. Our SG&#38;A results for fiscal 2009 reflect the impact of a negative comparable store sales environment, offset by a lower cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program and solid expense control. For fiscal 2009, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 25.1% compared to 28.1% for fiscal 2008. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization decreased 4.4% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009 from $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.6% for fiscal 2009 and 2.5% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating Income increased 10.2% to $4.8 billion for fiscal 2009 from $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.3% for fiscal 2009 compared to 6.1% for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 7.4% for fiscal 2008. \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\nIn fiscal 2009, we recognized $821 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $769 million in fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.2% for fiscal 2009 compared to 1.1% for fiscal 2008. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding these charges, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2008. The increase in Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to lower sales. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 34.2% for fiscal 2009 from 35.6% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects benefits arising from a favorable foreign tax settlement and a realignment of our foreign corporate structure. \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.55 for fiscal 2009 and $1.37 for fiscal 2008. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-downs of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2009 were $1.66 compared to $1.78 for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 6.7%. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nOn August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 consist of earnings of $41 million, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share in fiscal 2008, in each case for the settlement of working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2010, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was approximately $4.6 billion compared to approximately $5.1 billion for fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items partially offset by increased earnings. \n\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2010 was $1.0 billion compared to $755 million for fiscal 2009. This change was primarily due to increased Capital Expenditures and lower Proceeds from Sales of Property and Equipment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn fiscal 2010, we spent $1.1 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 34% for core technology, 18% for merchandising and operations, 17% for maintenance, 9% for new stores and 22% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2010, we added eight new stores, including one relocation. \n\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2010 was $4.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion for fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to $2.4 billion more in Repurchases of Common Stock than in fiscal 2009, partially offset by a $998 million increase in Proceeds from Long-Term Borrowings and a $745 million decrease in Repayments of Long-Term Debt in fiscal 2010. \n\nWe repurchased 80.9 million shares of our common stock for $2.6 billion in fiscal 2010 and 7.7 million shares for $213 million in fiscal 2009. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 834.4 million shares of our common stock for a total of $30.1 billion. As of January 30, 2011, $9.9 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. \n\nWe have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility expires in July 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. As of January 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. \n\nWe use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Installments of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2010, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 46.1% compared to 44.7% at the end of fiscal 2009. \n\nAs of January 30, 2011, we guaranteed a $1.0 billion senior secured amortizing term loan in connection with the sale of HD Supply. We are responsible for up to $1.0 billion and any unpaid interest in the event of nonpayment by HD Supply. As reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HD Supply for the period ended October 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of this term loan as of October 31, 2010 was $940 million. The guaranteed loan is collateralized by certain assets of HD Supply. The original expiration date of the guarantee was August 30, 2012. On March 19, 2010, we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to April 1, 2014. The fair value of the guarantee at August 30, 2007 was $16 million and was recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities. The extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to $67 million, resulting in a $51 million charge to Interest and Other, net, for fiscal 2010. \n\nAs of January 30, 2011, we had $545 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2010, we repaid $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes that were due March 1, 2011. We issued commercial paper to repay the 5.20% Senior Notes and plan to refinance this debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. \n\nAt January 30, 2011, we had outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, that expire on December 16, 2013 with a notional amount of $1.25 billion that swap fixed rate interest on our $1.25 billion 5.25% Senior Notes for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 259 basis points. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of $47 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements. \n\nIn May 2010, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2011. At January 30, 2011, the approximate fair market value of this \n\n&#160; \n\nagreement was a liability of $2 million, which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle the agreement. \n\nIn September 2010, we issued $500 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020 at a discount of $1 million and $500 million of 5.40% Senior Notes due September 15, 2040 at a discount of $1 million (together, the &#147;September 2010 issuance&#148;). The net proceeds of the September 2010 issuance were used to refinance our 4.625% Senior Notes that matured August 15, 2010 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. \n\nIn fiscal 2009 and 2010, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the September 2010 issuance, which were accounted for as cash flow hedges. Upon the September 2010 issuance, we paid $193 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. This amount, net of income taxes, is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized to Interest Expense over the lives of the Senior Notes issued in September 2010. \n\nIn March 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that expires on March 1, 2016 with a notional amount of $500 million that swaps fixed rate interest on our $500 million 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016 for variable interest equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of January 30, 2011 (amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Payments Due by Fiscal Year &#160; Contractual Obligations \n\n&#160; Total &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2012-2013 &#160; &#160; 2014-2015 &#160; &#160; Thereafter &#160; Total Debt (1) \n\n&#160; $ 15,953 &#160; &#160; $ 1,452 &#160; &#160; $ 2,135 &#160; &#160; $ 780 &#160; &#160; $ 11,586 &#160; Capital Lease Obligations (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,259 &#160; &#160; &#160; 114 &#160; &#160; &#160; 192 &#160; &#160; &#160; 179 &#160; &#160; &#160; 774 &#160; Operating Leases \n\n&#160; &#160; 8,181 &#160; &#160; &#160; 783 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,338 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,125 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,935 &#160; Purchase Obligations (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,352 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,711 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,741 &#160; &#160; &#160; 900 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4) \n\n&#160; &#160; 63 &#160; &#160; &#160; 63 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 29,808 &#160; &#160; $ 4,123 &#160; &#160; $ 5,406 &#160; &#160; $ 2,984 &#160; &#160; $ 17,295 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $452 million.

Interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. At January 30, 2011, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 87% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 13% was floating-rate debt. A 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of January 30, 2011 we had, net of discounts, $9.3 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The aggregate market value of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 30, 2011 was approximately $9.8 billion. \n\nAlthough we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nImpact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices \n\nWe have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. \n\nRevenues \n\nWe recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. \n\nMerchandise Inventories \n\nOur Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 80% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2010 or 2009. \n\nIndependent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, &#147;swell&#148;) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelf-Insurance \n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers&#146; compensation, medical, product liability and automobile claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. \n\nVendor Allowances \n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors&#146; products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. \n\nVolume rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors&#146; products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SG&#38;A. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, management&#146;s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. \n\nThe assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. The estimate of cash flows includes management&#146;s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on Net Sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&#38;A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a leased location closes, we also recognize in SG&#38;A the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income. \n\nWe make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. A 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. \n\nAs part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no asset impairments in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and recorded $580 million of asset impairments in fiscal 2008. Also as part of our Rationalization Charges, we recorded no lease obligation costs in fiscal 2010 and recorded $84 million and $252 million of lease obligation costs in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the \n\n&#160; \n\nRationalization Charges. A 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. We also recorded impairments and other lease obligation costs on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of our identified reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows. \n\nWe make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in an impairment that is not material to our results of operations. \n\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. Impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets were not material for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn June 2009, the FASB issued &#147;Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)&#148; (&#147;FASB ASC 810-10&#148;), which clarifies that the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity&#146;s purpose and design and a company&#146;s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic performance. FASB ASC 810-10 requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept. FASB ASC 810-10 also requires additional disclosures about a company&#146;s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. This guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn June 2008, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "}
