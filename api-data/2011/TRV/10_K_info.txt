Discussions of the components of net income and segment operating income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis. \n\nOverview \n\nDiluted net income per share of $3.36 in 2011 decreased by 49% from 2010, while net income of $1.43 billion decreased by 56% from 2010. The lower rate of decline in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of common share repurchases. The decline in net income in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflected a significant increase in catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior year reserve development, along with lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (\"underlying underwriting margins\") related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, and lower net investment income and net realized investment gains. Catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $2.56 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $715 million and $1.25 billion, \n\nrespectively. Net income in 2011 benefited from a reduction in income tax expense of $104 million resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. \n\nDiluted net income per share of $6.62 in 2010 increased by 5% over 2009, despite a decrease in reported net income, due to the favorable impact of common share repurchases. Net income of $3.22 billion in 2010 was $406 million lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting a significant increase in catastrophe losses, a modest decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and reduced underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, partially offset by increases in net investment income and net realized investment gains. Net income in 2009 reflected a reduction in income tax expense of $89 million resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters and an $87 million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike that had been recorded in general and administrative expenses in 2008. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $1.11 billion and $457 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums of $22.09 billion in 2011 were $658 million, or 3%, higher than in 2010. In the Business Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2011 increased by 5% over 2010. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2011 decreased by 4% from 2010. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2011 increased by 3% over 2010. \n\nEarned premiums of $21.43 billion in 2010 were $14 million, or less than 1%, higher than in 2009. In the Business Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2010 declined 2% from 2009. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2010 decreased by less than 1% from 2009. In the Personal Insurance segment, earned premiums in 2010 increased 3% over 2009. \n\nFactors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment in 2011 and 2010 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments. \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Average investments(1) &#160; $ 70,471 &#160; $ 71,637 &#160; $ 73,130 &#160; Pretax net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,879 &#160; &#160; 3,059 &#160; &#160; 2,776 &#160; After-tax net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,330 &#160; &#160; 2,468 &#160; &#160; 2,290 &#160; Average pretax yield(2) &#160; &#160; 4.1 % &#160; 4.3 % &#160; 3.8 % Average after-tax yield(2) &#160; &#160; 3.3 % &#160; 3.4 % &#160; 3.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income. (2) Excludes net realized investment gains and losses and net unrealized investment gains and losses. \n\nNet investment income was $2.88 billion in 2011, $180 million, or 6%, lower than in 2010. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments of $2.54 billion in 2011 declined by $167 million compared with 2010, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, as well as lower average levels of fixed maturity invested assets due to the Company's common share repurchases. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments of $355 million in 2011 was $15 million lower than in 2010. The average pretax yield on the total investment portfolio \n\nwas 4.1% in 2011, compared with 4.3% in 2010, reflecting the decline in both fixed maturity and non-fixed maturity investment income. \n\nNet investment income was $3.06 billion in 2010, $283 million, or 10%, higher than in 2009. Non-fixed maturity investments generated net investment income of $370 million in 2010, compared with negative net investment income of $40 million in 2009. The increase in net investment income from non-fixed maturity investments in 2010 reflected improved investment market conditions. Investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2010 declined $112 million compared with 2009, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, as well as a lower average level of fixed maturity invested assets that reflected the impact of the Company's common share repurchases. The average pretax yield on the total investment portfolio was 4.3% in 2010, compared with 3.8% in 2009, reflecting the improvement in non-fixed maturity investment income. \n\nFee Income \n\nThe National Accounts market in the Business Insurance segment is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. The changes in fee income in 2011 and 2010 compared with the respective prior years are described in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows. \n\nNet Realized Investment Gains \n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net realized investment gains. \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Net Realized Investment Gains &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other-than-temporary impairment losses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total gains (losses) &#160; $ 30 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ (323 ) Non-credit component of impairments recognized in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources &#160; &#160; (55 ) &#160; (33 ) &#160; 65 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other-than-temporary impairment losses &#160; &#160; (25 ) &#160; (26 ) &#160; (258 ) Other net realized investment gains &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; 290 &#160; &#160; 275 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net realized investment gains &#160; $ 55 &#160; $ 264 &#160; $ 17 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted updated accounting guidance that changed the reporting of other-than-temporary impairments. See note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the adoption. \n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses on Investments &#151;Investment impairments in 2011 and 2010 were not significant. In 2009, worldwide financial markets experienced significant disruptions, and the United States and many other countries experienced an economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risks, reduced valuations of investments and decreased economic activity. These factors resulted in $258 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2009. Impairments in the fixed maturity portfolio in 2009 were $169 million and included $81 million related to structured mortgage securities, $70 million related to various issuers' deteriorated financial position and $18 million with respect to securities that the Company either had the intent to sell or did not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair value. Equity impairments in 2009 were $79 million, the majority of which were related to issuers in the financial services industry. Impairments in 2009 also included $10 million related to other investments. \n\nOther Net Realized Investment Gains &#151;Other net realized investment gains in 2011 were $80 million, primarily driven by $52 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $46 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities and $41 million of net realized \n\ninvestment gains related to other investments, partially offset by net realized investment losses of $62 million associated with U.S. Treasury futures contracts (which require daily mark-to-market settlement and are used to shorten the duration of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio). \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2010 were $290 million, including a $205 million pretax gain resulting from the Company's sale of substantially all of its remaining common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics, Inc. (Verisk) for total proceeds of approximately $230 million as part of a secondary public offering of Verisk. The 2010 total also included $96 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments and $25 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. These gains were partially offset by $30 million of net realized investment losses related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts. \n\nOther net realized investment gains in 2009 were $275 million. In October 2009, the Company sold a portion of its common stock holdings in Verisk for total proceeds of approximately $184 million as part of the initial public offering of Verisk. The Company recorded a pretax realized investment gain of $159 million on this sale in 2009. Other net realized investment gains in 2009 also included $100 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $23 million of net realized investment gains associated with the U.S. Treasury futures contracts and $23 million of net realized investment losses related to foreign exchange. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nOther revenues primarily consist of premium installment charges. In 2010, this category also included $60 million of expenses related to the Company's purchase and retirement of $885 million of its $1.0 billion 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $16.28 billion, $3.07 billion, or 23%, higher than in 2010. The increase primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development, the impact of loss cost trends and higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $2.56 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2011 primarily resulted from numerous tornadoes, wind and hail storms and severe winter storms, as well as Hurricane Irene. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $715 million and $1.25 billion, respectively. With respect to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011, accident years prior to and including 2009 experienced $1.10 billion of net favorable prior year reserve development, while the 2010 accident year experienced $383 million of net unfavorable prior year reserve development. Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses were $13.21 billion in 2010, $802 million, or 6%, higher than in 2009. The increase primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, the modest decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and the impact of loss cost trends. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $1.11 billion and $457 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from several severe wind and hail storms, as well as severe winter storms and an earthquake in Chile. Catastrophe losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail storms, as well as flooding. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 were $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $3.88 billion, $74 million, or 2%, higher than in 2010. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was $3.80 billion, virtually level with the 2009 total. Changes in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in both 2011 and 2010 were generally consistent with the changes in earned premiums as compared with the respective prior year. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2011 were $3.56 billion, $150 million, or 4%, higher than in 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to a higher level of state assessment expenses in the Business Insurance segment, increases in employee- and technology-related costs to enhance operations and support future business growth in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment and costs associated with the Company's direct to consumer initiative in the Personal Insurance segment. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2010 were $3.41 billion, $40 million, or 1%, higher than in 2009. The 2009 total included a reduction of $87 million in the estimate of property windpool assessments due to a decline in estimated insurance industry losses related to Hurricane Ike. Excluding that adjustment in 2009, general and administrative expenses in 2010 were $47 million, or 1%, lower than in 2009. The decline was concentrated in the Business Insurance segment, and was largely offset by higher expenses in the Personal Insurance segment resulting from the Company's direct to consumer initiative and in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment due to employee- and technology-related costs to enhance operations and support future business growth. \n\nHurricane-related property windpool assessments are levied on insurers periodically by state-created insurance and windstorm insurance entities such as Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in Florida, Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. These assessments are levied on the insurers writing business in those states to fund the operating deficits of such entities during periods of significant storm activity. Hurricane-related assessments are reported as a component of \"General and Administrative Expenses\" as the amounts paid to such entities are not insured losses of the Company. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $386 million, $388 million and $382 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 over 2009 primarily reflected a higher average level of debt outstanding in 2010. \n\nEffective Tax Rate \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate was (5%), 25% and 23% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company's income tax benefit of $74 million in 2011 primarily reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. In addition, the income tax benefit in 2011 included the $104 million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters recorded in the first quarter of 2011. The effective tax rate in 2009 also benefited from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. Excluding that benefit in 2009, the effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 were virtually level. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratios \n\nThe consolidated GAAP combined ratio of 105.1% in 2011 was 11.9 points higher than the consolidated GAAP combined ratio of 93.2% in 2010. \n\nThe consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 72.9% in 2011 was 11.9 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.0% in 2010. Catastrophe losses accounted for 11.6 points and 5.2 points of the 2011 and 2010 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 3.2 points and 5.8 points of benefit to the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development in 2011 was 2.9 points higher than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of loss cost trends and higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. \n\nThe consolidated underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2011 was level with the underwriting expense ratio in 2010. \n\nThe consolidated GAAP combined ratio of 93.2% in 2010 was 4.0 points higher than the consolidated GAAP combined ratio of 89.2% in 2009. \n\nThe consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.0% in 2010 was 3.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.3% in 2009. Catastrophe losses accounted for 5.2 points and 2.1 points of the 2010 and 2009 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 5.8 points and 6.2 points of benefit to the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development in 2010 was 0.2 points higher than the 2009 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of loss cost trends. \n\nThe consolidated underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2010 was 0.3 points higher than the 2009 consolidated underwriting expense ratio of 31.9%. The 2009 ratio reflected a 0.4 point benefit resulting from the reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike. Excluding that factor in 2009, the consolidated underwriting expense ratio in 2010 was 0.1 points lower than in 2009. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Business Insurance &#160; $ 12,418 &#160; $ 11,891 &#160; $ 12,098 &#160; Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; &#160; 3,408 &#160; &#160; 3,534 &#160; &#160; 3,713 &#160; Personal Insurance &#160; &#160; 8,061 &#160; &#160; 7,877 &#160; &#160; 7,474 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 23,887 &#160; $ 23,302 &#160; $ 23,285 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Business Insurance &#160; $ 11,340 &#160; $ 10,857 &#160; $ 10,902 &#160; Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; &#160; 3,102 &#160; &#160; 3,211 &#160; &#160; 3,285 &#160; Personal Insurance &#160; &#160; 7,745 &#160; &#160; 7,567 &#160; &#160; 7,149 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 22,187 &#160; $ 21,635 &#160; $ 21,336 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2011 both increased by 3% over 2010. In 2010, gross written premiums increased by less than 1% over 2009, while net written premiums increased by 1%. Factors contributing to the changes in gross and net written premiums in each segment in 2011 and 2010 as \n\ncompared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT \n\nBusiness Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Business Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 11,327 &#160; $ 10,766 &#160; $ 10,968 &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 2,041 &#160; &#160; 2,156 &#160; &#160; 1,902 &#160; Fee income &#160; &#160; 295 &#160; &#160; 285 &#160; &#160; 306 &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 31 &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; 42 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues &#160; $ 13,694 &#160; $ 13,235 &#160; $ 13,218 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 12,206 &#160; $ 10,157 &#160; $ 9,778 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating income &#160; $ 1,354 &#160; $ 2,301 &#160; $ 2,590 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 73.1 % &#160; 59.1 % &#160; 53.9 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 31.6 &#160; &#160; 32.2 &#160; &#160; 32.2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 104.7 % &#160; 91.3 % &#160; 86.1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nOperating income of $1.35 billion in 2011 was $947 million, or 41%, lower than in 2010. The decrease in 2011 primarily reflected lower net favorable prior year reserve development and a significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, and lower net investment income. These factors were partially offset by an increase in business volumes and a $76 million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $245 million in 2011, compared with $901 million in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.02 billion, compared with $437 million in 2010. \n\nOperating income of $2.30 billion in 2010 was $289 million, or 11%, lower than in 2009. The decrease in 2010 primarily reflected a significant increase in catastrophe losses, a modest decline in net favorable prior year reserve development, lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, partially offset by an increase in net investment income and a decline in general and administrative expenses. In addition, operating income in 2009 included a benefit of $42 million from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters and a $38 million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike. Catastrophe losses in 2010 were $437 million, compared with $176 million in 2009. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $901 million in 2010, compared with $1.03 billion in 2009. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums of $11.33 billion in 2011 were $561 million, or 5%, higher than in 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. Earned premiums in 2011 also benefited from positive audit premium adjustments related to increased insured exposures for existing policyholders, compared with negative audit premium adjustments in 2010 related to decreased insured exposures for existing policyholders. In 2010, earned premiums of $10.77 billon were $202 million, or 2%, lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting reduced insured exposures due to lower levels of economic activity in 2010. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income of $2.04 billion in 2011 was $115 million, or 5%, lower than in 2010. In 2010, net investment income of $2.16 billion was $254 million, or 13% higher than in 2009. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the changes in the Company's net investment income in 2011 and 2010 as compared with the respective prior year. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nFee Income \n\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2011 increased by $10 million, or 4%, over 2010, driven by strong business retention rates coupled with higher serviced premium and claim volume in workers' compensation residual market pools. In 2010, fee income decreased $21 million, or 7%, from 2009, primarily reflecting lower new business volume due to lower levels of economic activity and lower serviced premium and claim volume due to the de-population of workers' compensation residual market pools. The decline in 2010 also reflected the impact of both lower claim volume and lower loss costs (as fees are based either on the number of claims serviced or as a percentage of losses) driven by workers' compensation reforms, as well as overall lower claim frequency and increased competition. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $8.45 billion, $1.94 billion, or 30%, higher than in 2010. The increase in 2011 primarily reflected a significant decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and a significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with the impact of loss cost trends that included slightly higher than expected loss costs in the workers' compensation and commercial auto product lines. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $245 million, compared with $901 million in 2010. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was primarily driven by better than expected loss development in the general liability product line (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below), which was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2005-2008 and reflected what the Company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected, as well as better than expected loss development for the 2008 and 2009 accident years in the property product line. The workers' compensation line of business contributed slightly to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011, as favorable reserve development for the 2003-2009 accident years was largely offset by net unfavorable reserve development for the 2010 accident year related to higher than expected loss frequency. These factors were partially offset by $175 million and $76 million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves in 2011, respectively (discussed in further detail in the \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" sections herein), unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial multi-peril product line driven by higher than expected late reported hail claims from 2010 and unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial automobile product line that reflected worse than expected severity for the 2009-2010 accident years. Catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.02 billion, compared with $437 million in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 primarily resulted from winter storms and severe wind and hail storms throughout the United States, as well as Hurricane Irene. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2010 were $6.50 billion, $467 million, or 8%, higher than in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily reflected a significant increase in catastrophe losses, a modest \n\ndecline in net favorable prior year reserve development and the impact of loss cost trends. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $437 million and $176 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from several severe wind and hail storms as well as severe winter storms. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $901 million and $1.03 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was driven by better than expected loss development in the property, general liability (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below) and workers' compensation product lines for multiple accident years, as well as in assumed reinsurance, which is in runoff. The property product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2008 and 2009 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development in Industry-Focused Underwriting and Target Risk Underwriting. The general liability product line improvement was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior and reflected what the Company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the workers' compensation product line was concentrated in accident years 2007 and prior and resulted from better than expected loss development. The improvement in assumed reinsurance resulted primarily from favorable resolutions of claims and disputes from accident years 2002 and prior. In addition, better than expected loss development in the Business Insurance segment in recent years resulted in a favorable re-estimation of reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses in 2010. The net favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2010 was partially offset by $140 million and $35 million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves, respectively (discussed in further detail in the \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" sections herein). \n\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 of $1.03 billion was driven by better than expected loss development primarily concentrated in the general liability (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below), commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial property product lines for recent accident years, reflecting greater reductions in frequency than the Company expected based upon long-term frequency trends that have been declining. The general liability and commercial multi-peril product lines experienced better than anticipated loss development that was attributable to several factors, including what the Company believes to be improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. The commercial automobile line of business experienced better than expected loss development that was attributable to what the Company believes to be more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected, claim handling initiatives and improvements in auto safety technology. The commercial property product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2007 and 2008 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. In addition, the commercial property product line's 2005 accident year experience improved due to the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. The net favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2009 was partially offset by $185 million and $70 million increases to asbestos reserves and environmental reserves, respectively (discussed in more detail in the \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" sections herein). \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Expenses \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $1.82 billion, $66 million, or 4%, higher than in 2010. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was $1.75 billion, $26 million, or 1%, lower than in 2009. The changes in both 2011 and 2010 were consistent with the changes in earned premiums compared to the respective prior year. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2011 were $1.94 billion, $40 million, or 2%, higher than in 2010, primarily driven by a higher level of state assessment expenses related to workers' compensation business in New York, which more than offset an overall reduction in operating expenses. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2010 were $1.90 billion, $62 million, or 3%, lower than in 2009. The 2009 total included a $38 million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike. Adjusting for that reduction in 2009, general and administrative expenses in 2010 were $100 million, or 5%, lower than in 2009, driven by a decline in loss-based assessments that reflected the impact of favorable prior year reserve development and favorable rate changes, as well as a decline in employee-related expenses and a reduction in the amount of the Company's corporate advertising expense allocated to this segment resulting from a change in focus to the Personal Insurance segment's direct to consumer initiative in 2010. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratios \n\nThe GAAP combined ratio of 104.7% in 2011 was 13.4 points higher than the GAAP combined ratio of 91.3% in 2010. \n\nIn 2011, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 73.1% was 14.0 points higher than the 2010 ratio of 59.1%. Catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 accounted for 9.0 points and 4.1 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 2.2 points and 8.4 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 2.9 points higher than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of loss cost trends described above. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 31.6% in 2011 was 0.6 points lower than the 2010 underwriting expense ratio, primarily reflecting the impact of higher earned premiums. \n\nThe GAAP combined ratio of 91.3% in 2010 was 5.2 points higher than the GAAP combined ratio of 86.1% in 2009. \n\nIn 2010, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% was 5.2 points higher than the 2009 ratio of 53.9%. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 accounted for 4.1 points and 1.6 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 8.4 points and 9.3 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 1.8 points higher than the 2009 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of loss cost trends described above. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2010 was level with the 2009 underwriting expense ratio. The underwriting expense ratio in 2009 included a 0.3 point benefit from the reduction in the estimate of windpool assessments described above. Adjusting for that factor in 2009, the underwriting expense ratio for 2010 was 0.3 points lower than the 2009 underwriting expense ratio. The improvement in the 2010 adjusted underwriting expense ratio reflected the decline in expenses described above. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nThe Business Insurance segment's gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Select Accounts &#160; $ 2,830 &#160; $ 2,758 &#160; $ 2,804 &#160; Commercial Accounts &#160; &#160; 3,076 &#160; &#160; 2,753 &#160; &#160; 2,687 &#160; National Accounts &#160; &#160; 1,112 &#160; &#160; 1,111 &#160; &#160; 1,321 &#160; Industry-Focused Underwriting &#160; &#160; 2,473 &#160; &#160; 2,368 &#160; &#160; 2,363 &#160; Target Risk Underwriting &#160; &#160; 2,035 &#160; &#160; 2,008 &#160; &#160; 2,014 &#160; Specialized Distribution &#160; &#160; 886 &#160; &#160; 883 &#160; &#160; 901 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance Core &#160; &#160; 12,412 &#160; &#160; 11,881 &#160; &#160; 12,090 &#160; Business Insurance Other &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance &#160; $ 12,418 &#160; $ 11,891 &#160; $ 12,098 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Select Accounts &#160; $ 2,784 &#160; $ 2,718 &#160; $ 2,756 &#160; Commercial Accounts &#160; &#160; 2,890 &#160; &#160; 2,576 &#160; &#160; 2,493 &#160; National Accounts &#160; &#160; 782 &#160; &#160; 806 &#160; &#160; 902 &#160; Industry-Focused Underwriting &#160; &#160; 2,407 &#160; &#160; 2,299 &#160; &#160; 2,279 &#160; Target Risk Underwriting &#160; &#160; 1,587 &#160; &#160; 1,573 &#160; &#160; 1,568 &#160; Specialized Distribution &#160; &#160; 880 &#160; &#160; 872 &#160; &#160; 889 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance Core &#160; &#160; 11,330 &#160; &#160; 10,844 &#160; &#160; 10,887 &#160; Business Insurance Other &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Business Insurance &#160; $ 11,340 &#160; $ 10,857 &#160; $ 10,902 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2011, gross and net written premiums both increased by 4% over 2010. The increase in gross and net written premiums in 2011 was concentrated in Commercial Accounts and Industry-Focused Underwriting and, to a lesser extent, in Select Accounts. Gross and net written premiums were favorably impacted by positive audit premium adjustments in 2011, as compared with negative adjustments in 2010. Overall business retention rates remained strong in 2011 and were consistent with 2010. Both components of renewal premium changes&#151;renewal rate changes and insured exposure growth&#151;were positive in 2011 and improved over 2010. New business levels in 2011 declined modestly from 2010. \n\nIn 2010, gross and net written premiums decreased by 2% and less than 1%, respectively, from 2009. The difference in rates of decline between gross and net written premiums in 2010 was concentrated in National Accounts. A significant portion of gross written premiums for products offered by National Accounts is ceded to other insurers and residual market pools. As a result, the decline in gross written premiums did not have a proportional impact on net written premiums. The decline in gross and net written premiums in 2010 was driven in large part by lower levels of economic activity that impacted exposure changes at renewal, audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. \n\nSelect Accounts. Net written premiums of $2.78 billion in 2011 increased by 2% over 2010. Business retention rates remained strong and were consistent with 2010. Renewal premium changes, comprising both renewal rate changes and insured exposure growth, remained positive in 2011. Renewal premium changes in 2011 were level with 2010, as growth in renewal rate changes was offset by a lower \n\nlevel of insured exposure growth. New business volume in 2011 declined from 2010. Net written premiums of $2.72 billion in 2010 decreased 1% from 2009. Business retention rates in 2010 remained strong but were slightly lower than in 2009. Renewal premium changes remained positive in 2010 and increased over 2009, reflecting positive renewal rate changes and modest exposure growth. New business volume in 2010 declined compared with 2009, driven by lower business volumes from larger accounts where marketplace competition remained high. \n\nCommercial Accounts. Net written premiums of $2.89 billion in 2011 increased by 12% over 2010. The increase was partially due to the benefit of positive audit premium adjustments, compared with negative adjustments in 2010. Business retention rates remained strong, decreasing slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. Renewal premium changes were positive in 2011 and increased over 2010, primarily driven by positive renewal rate changes. New business volume in 2011 declined slightly from 2010. Net written premiums of $2.58 billion in 2010 were 3% higher than in 2009. Business retention rates in 2010 remained strong and increased slightly over 2009. Renewal premium changes in 2010 were slightly positive, as positive renewal rate changes were largely offset by a modest decline in exposures that reflected the impact of general economic conditions. New business levels also increased over 2009. \n\nNational Accounts. Net written premiums of $782 million in 2011 decreased by 3% from 2010, primarily reflecting negative retrospective premium adjustments related to prior year policies. Business retention rates remained high in 2011 and increased slightly over 2010, while renewal premium changes in 2011 also increased over 2010. New business volume in 2011 declined slightly from 2010. Net written premiums of $806 million in 2010 were 11% lower than in 2009, reflecting reduced insurance exposures driven by lower levels of economic activity, lower prior year retrospective premium adjustments and the loss of a large account. Despite the loss of that account, business retention rates remained high in 2010. \n\nIndustry-Focused Underwriting. Net written premiums of $2.41 billion in 2011 increased by 5% over 2010, primarily driven by growth in Construction, Oil &#38; Gas and Technology. Net written premiums of $2.30 billion in 2010 increased 1% over 2009. Premium growth in 2010 was concentrated in the Technology, Agribusiness and Oil &#38; Gas business units. \n\nTarget Risk Underwriting. Net written premiums of $1.59 billion in 2011 increased slightly over 2010, as premium growth in Inland Marine and Excess Casualty was largely offset by a decline in National Property. Net written premiums of $1.57 billion in 2010 were slightly higher than in 2009, as premium growth in the Boiler &#38; Machinery and Inland Marine business units was largely offset by a decline in National Property premium volume. \n\nSpecialized Distribution. Net written premiums of $880 million in 2011 increased slightly over 2010, driven by growth in the National Programs business unit. Net written premiums of $872 million in 2010 were 2% lower than in 2009, primarily driven by negative renewal premium changes in both the Northland and National Programs business units. Business retention rates in both business units increased over 2009. \n\nFinancial, Professional &#38; International Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 3,174 &#160; $ 3,317 &#160; $ 3,333 &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 414 &#160; &#160; 439 &#160; &#160; 452 &#160; Fee income &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; 27 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues &#160; $ 3,615 &#160; $ 3,785 &#160; $ 3,812 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 2,738 &#160; $ 2,920 &#160; $ 2,948 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating income &#160; $ 647 &#160; $ 620 &#160; $ 642 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 46.4 % &#160; 50.9 % &#160; 52.1 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 39.4 &#160; &#160; 36.8 &#160; &#160; 36.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 85.8 % &#160; 87.7 % &#160; 88.1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nOperating income of $647 million in 2011 was $27 million, or 4%, higher than operating income in 2010, primarily reflecting an increase in underwriting margins, partially offset by a decline in net investment income. The increase in underwriting margins was driven by higher net favorable prior year reserve development, declines in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a $14 million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters, partially offset by the impact of lower business volume, higher general and administrative expenses and a higher level of what the Company defines as large losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $360 million, compared with $259 million in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 were $55 million, compared with $82 million in 2010. \n\nOperating income of $620 million in 2010 was $22 million, or 3%, lower than in 2009, primarily driven by increases in catastrophe losses, non-catastrophe weather-related losses, and general and administrative expenses, as well as lower business volumes, which were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $259 million and $168 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $82 million and $3 million, respectively. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums of $3.17 billion in 2011 decreased by $143 million, or 4%, from 2010. The decline primarily reflected the impact of the termination of an exclusive broker relationship in the Republic of Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2010, lower construction surety premium volumes over the preceding twelve months, intentional underwriting actions undertaken in the Company's operations at Lloyd's intended to improve risk and reward (particularly in the catastrophe-exposed lines of business) and competitive market conditions. Earned premiums in 2011 benefited slightly from the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, earned premiums in 2010 benefited from the impact of a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties. \n\nEarned premiums of $3.32 billion in 2010 were slightly lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of intentional underwriting actions taken and competitive market conditions in the Professional Liability business unit and in the Company's operation at Lloyd's. These factors were largely offset by lower reinsurance costs, the impact of changes in the structure of the Company's reinsurance during the first quarter of 2010 that modestly increased retentions to directionally align retentions in the Company's International business with its U.S. practices, and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income of $414 million in 2011 decreased by $25 million, or 6%, compared with 2010. In 2010, net investment income of $439 million declined by $13 million, or 3%, from 2009. Included in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a result, reported net investment income in the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment reflects a significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including that from the Company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced a substantial increase in investment income in 2010. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the change in the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2011 and 2010 as compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $1.49 billion, $213 million, or 13%, lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development, a decline in catastrophe losses, lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower business volume, partially offset by a higher level of large losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $360 million and $259 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Both Bond &#38; Financial Products and International contributed to the net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011. In Bond &#38; Financial Products, net favorable development in 2011 primarily reflected better than expected results for accident years 2008 and prior for the contract surety business, and better than expected loss development for liability lines of business, driven by the fiduciary product for accident years 2008 and prior. In International, net favorable development in 2011 reflected better than expected loss development in Canada, primarily in the surety, directors and officers, and general liability lines of business for recent accident years and better than expected development in the Company's operation at Lloyd's in the aviation, kidnap &#38; ransom, and property lines for recent accident years. Catastrophe losses in 2011 were $55 million, compared with $82 million in 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2011 included losses from floods in Thailand and an earthquake in Japan. Catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from an earthquake in Chile. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2010 were $1.70 billion, $47 million, or 3%, lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by increases in catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses. In addition, the 2009 total included an increase in reserves for a non-renewed professional liability program in the Republic of Ireland. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $259 million and $168 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In Bond &#38; Financial Products, net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was driven by better than expected loss development in the surety and management liability lines of business due to lower than expected claim activity and loss severity in the 2008 and prior accident years. In International, the majority of net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 occurred at the Company's operation at Lloyd's, in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Net favorable prior year \n\nreserve development in 2009 was driven by better than expected loss development in International, particularly in the United Kingdom and Canada. In addition, the Aviation and Property lines of business at Lloyd's experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009. In Bond &#38; Financial Products, better than expected loss development for the contract surety business within the fidelity and surety product line for recent accident years also resulted in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $82 million and $3 million, respectively. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $603 million in 2011, $9 million, or 1%, lower than in 2010. The decrease in 2011 was less than the decrease in earned premiums, primarily due to the increase to earned premiums in 2010 as a result of a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $612 million in 2010, $10 million, or 2%, lower than in 2009, consistent with the decline in earned premiums when factoring in the impact on earned premiums in 2010 of the reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $648 million in 2011 were $40 million, or 7%, higher than in 2010. General and administrative expenses of $608 million in 2010 were $29 million, or 5%, higher than the 2009 total of $579 million. The increases in both 2011 and 2010 primarily reflecting increases in employee- and technology-related costs in International to enhance operations and support future business growth. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratios \n\nThe GAAP combined ratio of 85.8% in 2011 was 1.9 points lower than the GAAP combined ratio of 87.7% in 2010. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 46.4% in 2011 was 4.5 points lower than the 2010 ratio of 50.9%. Catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 accounted for 1.7 and 2.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 11.3 points and 7.8 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 0.3 points lower than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the factors discussed above. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 39.4% in 2011 was 2.6 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 36.8% in 2010. The increase in 2011 primarily reflected lower earned premium volumes in International and construction surety and the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above. \n\nThe GAAP combined ratio of 87.7% in 2010 was 0.4 points lower than the GAAP combined ratio of 88.1% in 2009. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 50.9% in 2010 was 1.2 points lower than the 2009 ratio of 52.1%. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 accounted for 2.4 and 0.1 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 7.8 points and 5.1 points of benefit, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 0.8 points lower than the 2009 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the factors discussed above. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 36.8% in 2010 was 0.8 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 36.0% in 2009, primarily reflecting the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above. \n\nWritten Premiums \n\nFinancial, Professional &#38; International Insurance gross and net written premiums by market were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Bond &#38; Financial Products &#160; $ 2,092 &#160; $ 2,133 &#160; $ 2,262 &#160; International &#160; &#160; 1,316 &#160; &#160; 1,401 &#160; &#160; 1,451 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; $ 3,408 &#160; $ 3,534 &#160; $ 3,713 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Bond &#38; Financial Products &#160; $ 1,953 &#160; $ 1,981 &#160; $ 2,040 &#160; International &#160; &#160; 1,149 &#160; &#160; 1,230 &#160; &#160; 1,245 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance &#160; $ 3,102 &#160; $ 3,211 &#160; $ 3,285 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGross and net written premiums in 2011 decreased by 4% and 3%, respectively, compared with 2010. In 2010, gross and net written premiums decreased by 5% and 2%, respectively, compared with 2009. \n\nNet written premiums of $1.95 billion in Bond &#38; Financial Products in 2011 were $28 million, or 1%, lower than in 2010, reflecting lower construction surety premium volume due to the continued slowdown in construction spending, and disciplined underwriting. The decrease also reflected the impact of reductions in surety reinsurance costs in 2010 associated with prior year reinsurance treaties. Excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2011 remained strong and were higher than in 2010. Renewal premium changes in 2011 were slightly positive (compared with slightly negative in 2010), as the modest growth in insured exposures exceeded negative renewal rate changes. New business volume in 2011 increased considerably over 2010. \n\nNet written premiums of $1.98 billion in Bond &#38; Financial Products in 2010 were $59 million, or 3% lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of underwriting actions taken and competitive market conditions in the Professional Liability and Public Company Liability business units. In addition, construction and commercial surety net written premium volume declined in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting the impact of the economic downturn. These factors were partially offset by a reduction in reinsurance costs. Excluding the surety line of business, business retention rates in 2010 were strong and slightly higher than in 2009. Renewal premium changes in 2010 were negative, reflecting both a decline in renewal rate changes and reduced insured exposures due to intentional underwriting actions taken and lower levels of economic activity. New business volume in 2010 declined from 2009, which reflected increasingly competitive market conditions in 2010. \n\nNet written premiums of $1.15 billion in International in 2011 were $81 million, or 7%, lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting the Company's withdrawal from personal insurance business in the Republic of Ireland during the preceding twelve months. Excluding the surety line of business, business retention rates in 2011 declined from 2010, primarily as a result of the Company's withdrawal from personal insurance business in the Republic of Ireland. New business volume in International in 2011 decreased from 2010, primarily reflecting the Company's withdrawal from personal insurance business in the Republic of Ireland and intentional underwriting actions in the Company's operations at Lloyd's. Renewal premium changes in 2011 were flat in 2011 (compared with slightly positive in 2010), as positive renewal rate changes were offset by a decline in insured exposures. \n\nNet written premiums of $1.23 billion in International in 2010 were $15 million, or 1%, lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of intentional underwriting actions and competitive market conditions. Those factors were largely offset by changes in the structure of the Company's reinsurance that modestly increased retentions to directionally align retentions in the Company's International business with its U.S. practices, as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In late 2008, the Company commenced an exclusive relationship with a broker in the Republic of Ireland that significantly increased the 2009 volume of personal automobile coverage written and also resulted in the Company writing personal household coverages. The Company ceased writing business through this relationship in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the surety line of business, retention rates in 2010 declined from 2009. New business volume also declined in 2010, primarily due to intentional underwriting actions and the termination of a broker relationship in the Republic of Ireland. Renewal premium changes were slightly positive in 2010, driven by positive renewal rate changes, partially offset by reduced insured exposures. \n\nPersonal Insurance \n\nResults of the Company's Personal Insurance segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Revenues: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earned premiums &#160; $ 7,589 &#160; $ 7,349 &#160; $ 7,117 &#160; Net investment income &#160; &#160; 424 &#160; &#160; 464 &#160; &#160; 422 &#160; Other revenues &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; 75 &#160; &#160; 84 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total revenues &#160; $ 8,083 &#160; $ 7,888 &#160; $ 7,623 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total claims and expenses &#160; $ 8,708 &#160; $ 7,314 &#160; $ 6,824 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating income (loss) &#160; $ (332 ) $ 440 &#160; $ 601 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio &#160; &#160; 83.5 % &#160; 68.1 % &#160; 65.0 % Underwriting expense ratio &#160; &#160; 30.1 &#160; &#160; 30.2 &#160; &#160; 29.6 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 113.6 % &#160; 98.3 % &#160; 94.6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative on GAAP combined ratio &#160; &#160; 2.5 % &#160; 2.2 % &#160; 1.7 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOverview \n\nAn operating loss of ($332) million in 2011 compared with operating income of $440 million in 2010. This decline in operating income was primarily driven by a significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, higher than expected non-catastrophe weather-related losses, lower net investment income and an increase in expenses related to the Company's direct to consumer initiative. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased business volumes, an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development and a $10 million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. Catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.49 billion, compared with $594 million in 2010. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $110 million, compared with $87 million in 2010. \n\nIn 2010, operating income of $440 million was $161 million, or 27%, lower than in 2009. The decline primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and an increase in expenses related to the Company's direct to consumer initiative. These factors were partially offset by increases in net investment income and business \n\nvolume, the favorable impact of earned pricing and loss cost trends, as well as a reduction in non-catastrophe weather-related losses. In addition, operating income in 2009 included a $48 million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike that had been recorded in general and administrative expenses in 2008. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $594 million and $278 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $87 million and $135 million, respectively. \n\nRevenues \n\nEarned Premiums \n\nEarned premiums of $7.59 billion in 2011 were $240 million, or 3%, higher than in 2010. Earned premiums of $7.35 billion in 2010 were $232 million, or 3%, higher than in 2009. The increases in both years primarily reflected an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. \n\nNet Investment Income \n\nNet investment income of $424 million in 2011 decreased by $40 million, or 9%, from 2010. In 2010, net investment income of $464 million increased by $42 million, or 10%, over 2009. Refer to the \"Net Investment Income\" section of \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" herein for a discussion of the change in the Company's net investment income in 2011 and 2010 as compared with the respective prior year. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology. \n\nClaims and Expenses \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses of $6.34 billion in 2011 were $1.34 billion, or 27%, higher than in 2010. The increase primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with the impact of loss cost trends, higher than expected non-catastrophe weather-related losses and higher business volumes. These factors were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $1.49 billion and $594 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2011 included the impact of multiple tornadoes and hail storms, primarily in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, as well as Hurricane Irene. Catastrophe losses in 2010 resulted from several severe wind and hail storms. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $110 million and $87 million, respectively. The 2011 total was driven by better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in the first half of 2010, as well as better than expected loss development in the 2006-2010 accident years for the umbrella line of business in the Homeowners and Other product line, partially offset by worse than expected loss development in the Automobile product line for the 2007-2010 accident years. \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2010 were $5.01 billion, $382 million, or 8%, higher than in 2009. The total in 2010 reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, the reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development and increased business volume, partially offset by a decline in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and improved loss cost trends. Catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $594 million and $278 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail storms, as well as flooding. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $87 million and $135 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was concentrated in the Homeowners and Other product line, primarily driven by favorable loss development in the 2008 and prior accident years, primarily for the umbrella line of business, partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the 2009 accident year for the homeowners line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated late-reported claims related to storms in \n\n2009. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 primarily reflected favorable loss development related to Hurricanes Ike and Katrina, as well as the 2007 California wildfires. \n\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs \n\nThe amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $1.46 million in 2011, $17 million, or 1%, higher than in 2010. The increase in 2011 was less than the increase in earned premiums, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program (the costs of which are classified in \"general and administrative expenses\") from a fixed-value compensation program (the costs of which are classified in \"amortization of deferred acquisition costs\"). The amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was $1.44 billion, $25 million, or 2%, higher than in 2009. The increase in 2010 was consistent with the increase in earned premiums. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $908 million in 2011 were $41 million, or 5%, higher than in 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily driven by costs associated with the Company's direct to consumer initiative, as well as the increase in contingent commission expense due to the increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program. The cost of the contingent commission program is not subject to deferred acquisition cost accounting treatment and, therefore, is expensed as incurred. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $867 million in 2010 were $83 million, or 11%, higher than in 2009. The total in 2009 reflected a $48 million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to Hurricane Ike, which occurred in 2008. Adjusting for the impact of the reduction in windpool assessments in 2009, general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased $35 million, or 4%, over 2009, primarily reflecting growth in business volume and continued costs supporting business growth and product development, including the Company's direct to consumer initiative. \n\nGAAP Combined Ratio \n\nThe GAAP combined ratio of 113.6% in 2011 was 15.3 points higher than the GAAP combined ratio of 98.3% in 2010. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 83.5% in 2011 was 15.4 points higher than the 2010 ratio of 68.1%. Catastrophe losses accounted for 19.6 and 8.1 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 1.5 points and 1.2 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 4.2 points higher than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 30.1% in 2011 was 0.1 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.2% in 2010. The slight decline in the underwriting expense ratio for 2011 compared with 2010 reflected growth in earned premiums and increases in costs associated with the Company's direct to consumer initiative, the impacts of which were largely offsetting. \n\nThe GAAP combined ratio of 98.3% in 2010 was 3.7 points higher than the GAAP combined ratio of 94.6% in 2009. \n\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.1% in 2010 was 3.1 points higher than the 2009 ratio of 65.0%. Catastrophe losses accounted for 8.1 and 3.9 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 1.2 points and 1.9 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior \n\nyear reserve development was 1.8 points lower than the 2009 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. \n\nThe underwriting expense ratio of 30.2% in 2010 was 0.6 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2009. The 2009 underwriting expense ratio included a 0.7 point benefit from the reduction in the estimate of windpool assessments described above. \n\nAgency Written Premiums \n\nGross and net written premiums by product line were as follows for the Personal Insurance segment's Agency business, which comprises business written through agents, brokers and other intermediaries and represents almost all of the segment's gross and net written premiums: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Gross Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Agency Automobile &#160; $ 3,706 &#160; $ 3,720 &#160; $ 3,610 &#160; Agency Homeowners and Other &#160; &#160; 4,221 &#160; &#160; 4,060 &#160; &#160; 3,809 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Agency Personal Insurance &#160; $ 7,927 &#160; $ 7,780 &#160; $ 7,419 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Net Written Premiums &#160; (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Agency Automobile &#160; $ 3,688 &#160; $ 3,698 &#160; $ 3,586 &#160; Agency Homeowners and Other &#160; &#160; 3,923 &#160; &#160; 3,772 &#160; &#160; 3,508 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Agency Personal Insurance &#160; $ 7,611 &#160; $ 7,470 &#160; $ 7,094 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2011, gross and net Agency written premiums both increased 2% over the respective totals in 2010. Gross and net Agency written premiums in 2010 both increased 5% over the respective totals in 2009. \n\nIn the Agency Automobile line of business, net written premiums in 2011 were slightly lower than in 2010. Business retention rates remained strong, while new business levels in 2011 were lower than in 2010. Renewal premium changes remained positive in 2011 and increased over 2010. In 2010, net written premiums in the Agency Automobile line of business increased 3% over 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of the introduction of twelve-month policy terms in certain markets in 2010. Excluding the impact of the change in policy terms in 2010, Agency Automobile net written premiums were virtually level with 2009. Business retention rates in 2010 remained strong and new business levels increased over 2009. Renewal premium changes were positive in 2010 but declined slightly from 2009. \n\nIn the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business, net written premiums in 2011 were 4% higher than in 2010. Business retention rates remained strong, while new business levels in 2011 were lower than in 2010. Renewal premium changes in 2011 remained positive and increased slightly over 2010. In 2010, net written premiums in the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business increased 8% over 2009, primarily driven by increases in renewal premium changes, business retention rates and new business levels. \n\nFor its Agency business, the Personal Insurance segment had approximately 7.7 million and 7.6 million active policies at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In the Agency Automobile line of business, active policies at December 31, 2011 were level with the same date in 2010. Active policies in the Agency Homeowners and Other line of business at December 31, 2011 grew by 1% over the same date in 2010. \n\nInterest Expense and Other \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Operating loss &#160; $ (279 ) $ (318 ) $ (233 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe operating loss for Interest Expense and Other in 2011 was $39 million lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting $39 million of expenses related to the Company's purchase and retirement of a significant portion of its 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures in 2010. After-tax interest expense in 2011 and 2010 was $251 million and $252 million, respectively. The $85 million increase in operating loss for Interest Expense and Other in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflected the $39 million of expenses referred to above. The operating loss in 2010 also included a $12 million increase in tax expense associated with recent federal health care legislation and an increase in interest expense. In addition, the operating loss in 2009 included a benefit of $28 million from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. After-tax interest expense in 2010 was $252 million, compared with $248 million in 2009. \n\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the Company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy), including claims against the Company's policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure. Factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. This trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. \n\nThe Company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and other Company defenses are not successful, the Company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Accordingly, although the Company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. \n\nMany coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. There also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the Company. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. \n\nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. \n\nTravelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into settlement agreements, which are subject to a number of contingencies, in connection with a number of these direct action claims. For a full discussion of these settlement agreements, including subsequent appeals and court decisions that have delayed their implementation, see the \"Asbestos Direct Action Litigation\" section of note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. \n\nThe Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the Home Office, Field Office and Assumed Reinsurance and Other categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the Company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2011, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review and noted the following trends: \n\n&#149; continued high level of litigation activity involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness; &#149; an increase in severity for certain policyholders as a result of the continued high level of litigation activity; &#149; stable payment patterns for a significant proportion of policyholders; 93 \n\n&#149; a further decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the Company due to additional settlement activity; &#149; continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity; and &#149; the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants. While the Company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims. \n\nAs in prior years, the annual claim review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and \"non-product\" liability. While the Home Office and Field Office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight reduction in the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims compared with the prior year period, gross asbestos-related payments in these categories increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. Payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target previously peripheral defendants. \n\nThe completion of these reviews and analyses in 2011 and 2010 resulted in $175 million and $140 million increases, respectively, in the Company's net asbestos reserves, primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders and higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from recent payment trends being moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. Notwithstanding these trends, the Company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods. The increase in 2010 also reflected increases in costs of litigating asbestos-related coverage matters and was partially offset by a $70 million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute. In 2009, the Company recorded a $185 million increase in asbestos reserves, primarily driven by a slight increase in the Company's assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders. \n\nNet asbestos losses paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $284 million, $350 million and $341 million, respectively. The decrease in gross and net paid losses in 2011 primarily resulted from completing, during 2010, the final installment payments on a previously reserved settlement. Approximately 19%, 32% and 41% of total net paid losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the Company's liability. \n\nThe Company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Number of Policyholders &#160; Total Net Paid &#160; Net Asbestos Reserves &#160; (at and for the year ended December 31, $ in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; Policyholders with settlement agreements &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ 112 &#160; $ 588 &#160; $ 583 &#160; Home office and field office &#160; &#160; 1,616 &#160; &#160; 1,705 &#160; &#160; 199 &#160; &#160; 209 &#160; &#160; 1,660 &#160; &#160; 1,778 &#160; Assumed reinsurance and other &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 31 &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; 191 &#160; &#160; 187 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 1,631 &#160; &#160; 1,722 &#160; $ 284 &#160; $ 350 &#160; $ 2,439 &#160; $ 2,548 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe \"policyholders with settlement agreements\" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts. Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at \n\nscheduled times. Included in this category are TPC's reserves for the settlements of the Statutory and Hawaii Actions and the Common Law Claims, which are described in the \"Asbestos Direct Action Litigation\" section of note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. \n\nThe \"home office and field office\" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential \"non-product\" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. In addition to IBNR amounts contained in the reserves for \"home office and field office\" policyholders and the costs of litigating asbestos coverage matters, the Company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the Company. The \"assumed reinsurance and other\" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. \n\nOn January 29, 2009, the Company and PPG Industries, Inc (\"PPG\"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of PPG, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG. The tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (\"Amended Plan\") proposed as part of the Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (\"PCC\", which is 50% owned by PPG) bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the proposed Amended Plan, which was filed on January 30, 2009, PCC, along with enumerated other companies (including PPG as well as the Company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims. Under the agreement in principle, the Company has the option to make a series of payments over the next 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the Trust to be created under the Amended Plan, or it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of March 31, 2012, would total approximately $468 million (approximately $439 million after reinsurance). The agreement in principle with PPG is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the Amended Plan, and the Company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied. The Company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the \"home office and field office\" category in the preceding table. \n\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss expenses and reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; $ 2,941 &#160; $ 3,097 &#160; $ 3,299 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (393 ) &#160; (339 ) &#160; (385 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 2,548 &#160; &#160; 2,758 &#160; &#160; 2,914 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 195 &#160; &#160; 262 &#160; &#160; 185 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (20 ) &#160; (122 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 175 &#160; &#160; 140 &#160; &#160; 185 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Losses paid: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 356 &#160; &#160; 418 &#160; &#160; 387 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (72 ) &#160; (68 ) &#160; (46 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 284 &#160; &#160; 350 &#160; &#160; 341 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 2,780 &#160; &#160; 2,941 &#160; &#160; 3,097 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (341 ) &#160; (393 ) &#160; (339 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; $ 2,439 &#160; $ 2,548 &#160; $ 2,758 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSee \"&#151;Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\" \n\nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION \n\nThe Company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several with other responsible parties. \n\nThe Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount. \n\nThe resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis as opposed to a claim-by-claim basis. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a \"buy-back\" of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance \n\nobligation which the Company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. Where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs. \n\nIn establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves. \n\nIn its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements. \n\nThe duration of the Company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years. \n\nThe Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in overall environmental claim payments, in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, in 2011, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $76 million, primarily because the degree to which those favorable trends continued was less than anticipated. In 2010, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $35 million due to a modest upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders. The Company increased its net environmental reserves by $70 million in 2009, due to a slight increase in the number of \n\npolicyholders tendering claims for the first time and upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders. \n\nNet environmental losses paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $86 million, $77 million and $91 million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, approximately 93% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $316 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 7% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $25 million), consists of case reserves. \n\nThe following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START (at and for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Beginning reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; $ 354 &#160; $ 389 &#160; $ 400 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (3 ) &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 351 &#160; &#160; 393 &#160; &#160; 414 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Incurred losses and loss expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; 45 &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (4 ) &#160; (10 ) &#160; (15 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 76 &#160; &#160; 35 &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Losses paid: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 88 &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; 96 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (2 ) &#160; (3 ) &#160; (5 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; &#160; 86 &#160; &#160; 77 &#160; &#160; 91 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ending reserves: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct &#160; &#160; 346 &#160; &#160; 354 &#160; &#160; 389 &#160; Ceded &#160; &#160; (5 ) &#160; (3 ) &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net &#160; $ 341 &#160; $ 351 &#160; $ 393 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES \n\nAs a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2011 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to \n\npolicyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. (Also see note 15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements). \n\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods. \n\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO \n\nThe Company's invested assets at December 31, 2011 were $72.70 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a conservative investment philosophy. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \n\nThe carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2011 was $64.23 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was \"Aa2\" at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. Standard &#38; Poor's recent downgrade of the credit rating of securities issued by the U.S. government had minimal impact on the overall credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2011. Below investment grade securities represented 3.1% and 3.0% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.2 (3.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2011 and 3.6 (3.9 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2010.

The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $7.33 billion and $7.29 billion, respectively, of advance refunded or escrowed-to-maturity bonds (collectively referred to as pre-refunded bonds), which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest. Such escrow accounts are verified as to their sufficiency by an external auditor and are almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities. Moody's Investors Service has assigned negative outlooks to municipal securities in both the state sector and local government sector within the United States. \n\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the $31.69 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2011 that were not pre-refunded. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2011, in millions) \n\n&#160; State General Obligation &#160; Local General Obligation &#160; Revenue &#160; Total Carrying Value &#160; Average Credit Quality(1) &#160; State: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Texas &#160; $ 437 &#160; $ 2,454 &#160; $ 1,349 &#160; $ 4,240 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; California &#160; &#160; 55 &#160; &#160; 1,759 &#160; &#160; 370 &#160; &#160; 2,184 &#160; &#160; Aa2 &#160; Illinois &#160; &#160; 175 &#160; &#160; 1,002 &#160; &#160; 529 &#160; &#160; 1,706 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; Washington &#160; &#160; 403 &#160; &#160; 876 &#160; &#160; 388 &#160; &#160; 1,667 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; Virginia &#160; &#160; 193 &#160; &#160; 658 &#160; &#160; 692 &#160; &#160; 1,543 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; Florida &#160; &#160; 422 &#160; &#160; 68 &#160; &#160; 838 &#160; &#160; 1,328 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; Minnesota &#160; &#160; 300 &#160; &#160; 762 &#160; &#160; 137 &#160; &#160; 1,199 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; Arizona &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 543 &#160; &#160; 634 &#160; &#160; 1,177 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; Colorado &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 793 &#160; &#160; 217 &#160; &#160; 1,010 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; Massachusetts &#160; &#160; 176 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 810 &#160; &#160; 995 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; Georgia &#160; &#160; 252 &#160; &#160; 401 &#160; &#160; 291 &#160; &#160; 944 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; Ohio &#160; &#160; 331 &#160; &#160; 302 &#160; &#160; 298 &#160; &#160; 931 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; Maryland &#160; &#160; 309 &#160; &#160; 449 &#160; &#160; 156 &#160; &#160; 914 &#160; &#160; Aaa/Aa1 &#160; Michigan &#160; &#160; 127 &#160; &#160; 338 &#160; &#160; 442 &#160; &#160; 907 &#160; &#160; Aa2 &#160; New York &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; 198 &#160; &#160; 691 &#160; &#160; 901 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; North Carolina &#160; &#160; 261 &#160; &#160; 460 &#160; &#160; 138 &#160; &#160; 859 &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; All Others(2) &#160; &#160; 2,208 &#160; &#160; 3,093 &#160; &#160; 3,884 &#160; &#160; 9,185 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 5,661 &#160; $ 14,165 &#160; $ 11,864 &#160; $ 31,690 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.

While its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default, the Company does not rely on enhanced credit characteristics provided by such third-party insurance. The downgrade during 2008 and 2009 of credit ratings of insurers of these securities resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of many such securities to the underlying rating of the respective security. Of the insured municipal securities in the Company's investment portfolio at December 31, 2011, approximately 99% were rated at A3 or above, and approximately 92% were rated at Aa3 or above, without the benefit of insurance. The Company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the Company's ability and intent to hold the securities. The average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was \"Aa2\" at December 31, 2011. The average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was \"Aa1\" at December 31, 2011 with and without the enhancement provided by third-party insurance. \n\nDebt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments \n\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments at December 31, 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, 2011, in millions) \n\n&#160; Carrying Value &#160; Average Credit Quality(1) &#160; Foreign Government: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United Kingdom &#160; $ 993 &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; Canada &#160; &#160; 971 &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; Germany &#160; &#160; 119 &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; Norway &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; Aaa &#160; All Others(2)(3) &#160; &#160; 155 &#160; &#160; Aa1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 2,318 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Rated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.

The table includes $150 million of short-term securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated \"A-1+\" and/or \"P-1,\" are included as \"Aaa\" rated securities. \n\nOn January 13, 2012, Standard &#38; Poor's downgraded the sovereign ratings of nine Eurozone countries, including France (from \"AAA\" to \"AA+\"), Austria (from \"AAA\" to \"AA+\"), and Spain (from \"AA-\" to \"A\"). On January 27, 2012, Fitch downgraded the sovereign ratings of five Eurozone countries, including Spain (from \"AA-\" to \"A\"). If these downgrades were in effect at December 31, 2011, the average credit rating of Spain for \"debt securities issued by foreign governments\" in the foregoing table would have been \"A2.\" The downgrades of the remaining four countries did not alter their average credit quality ratings shown in the foregoing table. \n\nIn addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $262 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships (both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling $134 million to these partnerships. The Company also has $4 million of nonredeemable preferred stock (included in equity securities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet) issued by companies in the Eurozone. \n\nMortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities \n\nThe Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $3.52 billion and $4.16 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities including \n\npass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for both guaranteed and non-guaranteed securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's investment strategy generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. Included in the totals at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $1.82 billion and $2.09 billion, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans) guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. Also included in those totals were residential CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.70 billion and $2.07 billion, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\nApproximately 38% of the Company's CMO holdings were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. The average credit rating of the $1.05 billion and $1.28 billion of non-guaranteed CMO holdings at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was \"Ba1\" and \"Baa1,\" respectively. The average credit rating of all of the above securities was \"Aa3\" and \"Aa1\" at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\nThe Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs. \n\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans \n\nAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $446 million and $549 million, respectively. The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities. \n\nAlternative Documentation Mortgages and Sub-Prime Mortgages \n\nAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, the \"mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities\" and \"asset-backed and other\" categories in the foregoing table included collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $351 million and $297 million, respectively (comprising approximately 0.5% of the Company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). The disruption in secondary investment markets provided the Company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional mortgage-backed securities at discounted prices. The Company purchased $128 million and $31 million of such securities in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. Alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. The average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the Company was \"Baa2\" at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. \n\nEquity Securities Available for Sale, Real Estate and Short-Term Securities \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes. \n\nOther Investments \n\nAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.45 billion and $2.93 billion, respectively. The Company's other investments are primarily comprised of private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities, which are subject to more volatility than the Company's fixed maturity investments. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. Net investment income provided by these asset classes was $292 million and $304 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared with negative net investment income of $106 million in 2009. The negative net investment income in 2009 reflected market conditions. \n\nSecurities Lending \n\nThe Company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. The Company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. \n\nNet Unrealized Investment Gains \n\nThe net unrealized investment gains that were included as a separate component of accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; $ 4,238 &#160; $ 2,650 &#160; $ 2,536 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 145 &#160; &#160; 147 &#160; &#160; 78 &#160; Other investments &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; 30 &#160; &#160; 208 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unrealized investment gains before tax &#160; &#160; 4,399 &#160; &#160; 2,827 &#160; &#160; 2,822 &#160; Tax expense &#160; &#160; 1,528 &#160; &#160; 968 &#160; &#160; 966 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net unrealized investment gains at end of year &#160; $ 2,871 &#160; $ 1,859 &#160; $ 1,856 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet pretax unrealized investment gains were $4.40 billion, $2.83 billion and $2.82 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company's fixed maturities portfolio at December 31, 2011 experienced an increase in valuation compared with the prior year-end, primarily due to the continuing decline in market interest rates. The Company's fixed maturities and equity securities portfolios at December 31, 2010 experienced increases in valuations compared with the prior year-end, which were offset by a decrease in net unrealized appreciation on other investments that primarily resulted from the Company's sale of substantially all of its common stock holdings in Verisk Analytics, Inc. That sale generated a pretax realized investment gain of $205 million in 2010. \n\nThe following table summarizes, for all fixed maturities and equity securities reported at fair value for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost at December 31, 2011, the gross unrealized \n\ninvestment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position of greater than 20% of amortized cost: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Period For Which Fair Value Is Less Than 80% of Amortized Cost &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; 3 Months or Less &#160; Greater Than 3 Months, 6 Months or Less &#160; Greater Than 6 Months, 12 Months or Less &#160; Greater Than 12 Months &#160; Total &#160; Fixed maturities : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ 2 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total fixed maturities &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 22 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThese unrealized investment losses at December 31, 2011 represent less than 1% of the combined fixed maturity and equity security portfolios on a pretax basis and less than 1% of shareholders' equity on an after-tax basis. \n\nFor fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity. \n\nAt December 31, 2011, below investment grade securities comprised 3.1% of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2011 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $741 million and a fair value of $699 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized investment loss of $42 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented approximately 1% of both the total amortized cost and the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2011 and accounted for 47% of the total gross pretax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2011. \n\nImpairment Charges \n\nImpairment charges included in net realized investment gains in the consolidated statement of income were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; 2009 &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; $ &#151; &#160; Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Debt securities issued by foreign governments &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; 81 &#160; All other corporate bonds &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; &#160; 88 &#160; Redeemable preferred stock &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total fixed maturities &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 169 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Common stock &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; Non-redeemable preferred stock &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 64 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total equity securities &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; 79 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other investments &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 258 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInvestment impairments in 2011 and 2010 were not significant. In 2009, worldwide financial markets experienced significant disruptions, and the United States and many other countries experienced an economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risks, reduced valuations of investments and decreased economic activity. Those factors resulted in the higher level of other-than-temporary investment impairments recognized by the Company in 2009. \n\nFollowing are the pretax realized losses on investments sold during the year ended December 31, 2011: \n\n##TABLE_START (for the year ended December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; Loss &#160; Fair Value &#160; Fixed maturities &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 214 &#160; Equity securities &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 34 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 250 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations. \n\nCATASTROPHE MODELING \n\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including computer modeling processes, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. The Company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting \n\ncatastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2011, a new version of a third-party proprietary computer model utilized by the Company, as well as others in the insurance industry, to estimate potential aggregate hurricane losses was released. After evaluating multiple third-party models and calibrating its own historical loss experience and underwriting practices, the Company increased its estimated modeled loss, using its own proprietary modeling processes, from a single U.S. hurricane by a range of 10% to 24%. For each modeled event, the percentage magnitude of the loss increase within this range will vary based on this evaluation. \n\nThe tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the current version of the proprietary computer model utilized by the Company at December 31, 2011. For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.4 billion, or 6% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Dollars (in billions) &#160; Likelihood of Exceedance(1) \n\n&#160; Single U.S. Hurricane &#160; Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake &#160; 2.0% (1-in-50) &#160; $ 1.0 &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; 1.0% (1-in-100) &#160; $ 1.4 &#160; $ 0.6 &#160; 0.4% (1-in-250) &#160; $ 2.4 &#160; $ 0.9 &#160; 0.1% (1-in-1,000) &#160; $ 5.4 &#160; $ 2.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Percentage of Common Equity(2) &#160; Likelihood of Exceedance \n\n&#160; Single U.S. Hurricane &#160; Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake &#160; 2.0% (1-in-50) &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; 2 % 1.0% (1-in-100) &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; 3 % 0.4% (1-in-250) &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; 4 % 0.1% (1-in-1,000) &#160; &#160; 25 % &#160; 9 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) An event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a \"1-in-50 year event.\" As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. (2) The percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions. \n\nThe threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2011 and catastrophic reinsurance program at January 1, 2012, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude most loss adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts. \n\nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. \n\nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions and acts of terrorism. For these other perils, in contrast to hurricanes and earthquakes, models are less widely used, or are not used, by the Company and by the industry. Further, compared to models for hurricanes and earthquakes, models, if any, for the other perils are newer, less reliable (given the even greater difficulty of predicting the risks) and not as extensively tested. \n\nFor more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\" and \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.\" \n\nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS \n\nSevere weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophe and other weather-related events. Some scientists believe that, in recent years, changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters. Accordingly, if climate conditions change in the future, the Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable. \n\nThe Company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this report and under \"&#151;Outlook\" herein. For example, among other things: \n\n&#149; Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance\" and \"&#151;Outlook&#151;Underwriting Gain/Loss.\" 112 \n\n&#149; Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the Southeastern United States, among other areas. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.\" &#149; Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers. For example, state insurance regulation could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. If the Company is unable to implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. See \"Risk Factors&#151;Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.\" &#149; The full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. Through the Company's Emerging Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. See \"Risk Factors&#151;The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\" Climate change regulation also could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses. \n\nThe Company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. \n\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES \n\nCeded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools for which liability is mostly joint and several, and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to the Company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the Company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. The Company also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. The Company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and the price of their product offerings. After reinsurance is purchased, the Company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. In addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the European Union and the United Kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority. \n\nThe Company has also entered into Master Security Agreements with certain reinsurers. These agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral. The specific conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided by these agreements vary based on a number of \n\nfactors including, but not limited to, the reinsurers' legal structure and trading history with the Company. \n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses &#160; $ 6,216 &#160; $ 6,934 &#160; Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance &#160; &#160; (345 ) &#160; (363 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net reinsurance recoverables &#160; &#160; 5,871 &#160; &#160; 6,571 &#160; Mandatory pools and associations(1) &#160; &#160; 2,020 &#160; &#160; 2,043 &#160; Structured settlements &#160; &#160; 3,291 &#160; &#160; 3,380 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 11,182 &#160; $ 11,994 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes impact from certain reclassifications made to 2010 amounts to conform to 2011 presentation. \n\nThe $700 million decline in net reinsurance recoverables since December 31, 2010 reflected cash collections and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development. \n\nThe following table presents the Company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2011 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of each reinsurer group at February 16, 2012: \n\n##TABLE_START Reinsurer Group \n\n&#160; Reinsurance Recoverable &#160; A.M.

In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a liability and as a reinsurance recoverable, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments if and to the extent the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. The following table presents the Company's top five groups \n\nby structured settlements at December 31, 2011 (in millions). Also included is the A.M.

A number of such companies have been subjected to downgrades and/or negative outlook changes by various ratings agencies, including those with which the Company conducts business. The Company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts. \n\nOUTLOOK \n\nThe following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position. \n\nPremiums. The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure. Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of the Business Insurance segment, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Net written premiums are also impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs. \n\nGiven the possibility that more active weather patterns such as the Company experienced in 2011 and 2010 may continue, as well as the possibility that interest rates may remain low for some period of time, along with the current level of profitability in certain of its product lines, the Company is undertaking efforts to improve its underwriting margins. These efforts include seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms and conditions on many of its insurance products, and may also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs. These efforts may not be successful and may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. Nonetheless, the Company currently expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong relative to historical experience. The Company also expects to continue to achieve renewal price increases during 2012. In the Business Insurance segment, the Company expects a continued increase in renewal premium changes, including increases in both of its components of rate changes and, subject to the economic uncertainties described below, insured exposures, during 2012, compared with 2011. In the Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance segment, the Company expects that renewal premium changes, primarily due to the insured exposure component, will modestly improve during 2012 compared with 2011. In the Personal Insurance segment, the Company expects both Agency Automobile and Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes during 2012 will remain positive and will be slightly higher than in 2011 based on the Company's actions to file for rate increases. The need for state \n\nregulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. \n\nThe pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2012 for new business, not only in Business Insurance and Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance, but also in Personal Insurance, where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers, sometimes referred to as \"comparative raters\", has increased the focus on price over other competitive factors. See \"Risk Factors&#151;The intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.\" In addition, the Company launched a new distribution channel in 2009 that markets personal insurance products directly to consumers, which is expected to generate modest growth in premium volume for Personal Insurance during 2012. \n\nCurrent economic conditions have been somewhat volatile and there is increased uncertainty as to whether the U.S. or the global economy will grow modestly, remain stagnant or enter a recession. Economic growth experienced in 2011 may or may not continue, or may continue at a slower rate for an extended period of time. In addition, some economic conditions, such as the commercial and residential real estate environment and employment rates, may continue to be weak. If weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate, the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could adversely impact net written premiums during 2012 and, since earned premiums lag net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted during and following 2012. \n\nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. \n\nCatastrophe and other weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses in 2011 which adversely impacted its results of operations. The Company's results of operations would continue to be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses were to occur during 2012. \n\nThe Company utilizes a general catastrophe reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes. In addition to the coverage provided under this treaty, the Company also utilizes a catastrophe bond program, as well as a Northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty, to protect against certain losses resulting from catastrophes in the Northeastern United States. For additional information regarding the Company's catastrophe reinsurance program, see \"Item 1&#151;Business&#151;Reinsurance\" in this report. \n\nAs discussed in more detail in Item 1, the attachment point for index-based losses and the maximum limit of the Company's catastrophe bond program are reset annually to maintain modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss on the respective catastrophe bonds equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss. For the period May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit will be based on the new version of the third-party proprietary computer model used to estimate potential hurricane losses for the entire industry, discussed in \"Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Catastrophe Modeling.\" The Company estimates that the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit on the reinsurance agreements in the catastrophe bond program will increase by as much as 70%, reflecting increases in the third-party model's industry estimate of covered losses. The Company regularly reviews its catastrophe reinsurance coverage and may seek additional catastrophe reinsurance coverage, either through general catastrophe \n\nreinsurance or through catastrophe bonds, to provide protection against the higher potential retention of catastrophe losses resulting from the expected increase in the attachment point. \n\nIncreased late reporting of weather-related losses by claimants over the last several years, particularly losses from hail damage, has also adversely impacted the Company's results of operations. Actions that the Company has taken in response, including increased pricing in some areas, changes to terms and conditions and an increased focus on fraud detection, may not be successful. \n\nIn recent years, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development, although at lower levels in recent quarters, driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the Company's segments. The lower levels of prior year reserve development in recent quarters may be in part due to the estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of prior year reserve development in previous years. If that trend continues, the better than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels, or even lower levels. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods. \n\nIn Business Insurance, the Company expects that the anticipated impact of the improving trend in renewal premium changes, partially offset by an expected modest increase in underlying losses, and weather patterns consistent with the Company's expectations will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during 2012 that are higher than in 2011, beginning in the first half of 2012. In Financial, Professional &#38; International Insurance, the Company expects that the anticipated impact of lower underlying losses, partially offset by higher employee- and technology-related costs to enhance operations and support future business growth in International, will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during 2012 that are modestly higher than in 2011, beginning in the first half of 2012. In Personal Insurance, the Company anticipates increased underlying underwriting margins during 2012 as compared with 2011, beginning in the first half of 2012, reflecting the anticipated impact of continued positive renewal premium changes, partially offset by a modest increase in underlying losses, and weather patterns consistent with the Company's expectations. Also in Personal Insurance, the Company's direct to consumer initiative, as discussed above, while intended to enhance the Company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures. \n\nInvestment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. The Company reduced its short-term investment holdings from $5.62 billion at December 31, 2010 to $3.59 billion at December 31, 2011. \n\nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, real estate and insurance joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. \n\nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Long-term interest rates declined in the second half of 2011 and are very low by historic standards. As a result, the Company expects investment returns for its fixed maturity investment portfolio to be slightly lower during 2012 than in recent periods due to lower reinvestment yields available for maturing long-term \n\nfixed maturity investments. Short-term interest rates are expected to remain at or near historically low levels during 2012. Given recent unfavorable general economic and investment market conditions, the Company expects investment income from the non-fixed maturity portfolio in 2012 to be lower than in 2011. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions deteriorate in 2012, the Company could also experience further reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments. For further discussion of the Company's investment portfolio, see \"Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Investment Portfolio\" in this report. For a discussion of the risks to our business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to our investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled \"During or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected\" and \"Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses\" included in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this report. \n\nCapital Position. The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. In recent years, the Company has returned capital to its shareholders, comprising dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases, in amounts that have exceeded its operating income. In 2012, the Company expects that the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income. In addition, actual amounts of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's existing ratings from independent rating agencies, share price, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, strategic initiatives and other market conditions. For information regarding the Company's common share repurchases in 2011, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Share Repurchases\" in this report. \n\nThe Company had a net after-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.77 billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2011. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. \n\nMany of the statements in this \"Outlook\" section are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company's control. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. See \"&#151;Forward Looking Statements.\" For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors\" and \"Item 7&#151;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Critical Accounting Estimates\" in this report. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. The liquidity requirements of the Company's business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on investments. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses, and in recent years, for common share repurchases. The timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable. Such claims increase liquidity requirements. The timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, \n\nmay also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of the Company's management that the Company's future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources. \n\nAt December 31, 2011, total cash and short-term invested assets aggregating $2.39 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 74 days were held in the United States by the holding company. These assets are sufficient to meet the holding company's current liquidity requirements and are more than two times the Company's minimum target level. These liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt service and contributions to its qualified pension plan from time to time. \n\nThe holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. U.S. income taxes have not been recognized on $649 million of the Company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2011, as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. Furthermore, taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the U.S. tax on dividend distributions if such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company. The amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2011. \n\nThe Company has a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. The Company also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in 2013. This line of credit also supports the Company's $800 million commercial paper program, of which $100 million was outstanding at December 31, 2011. The Company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. \n\nThe Company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $432 million to provide much of the capital needed to support its obligations at Lloyd's. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand. \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $2.17 billion, $3.05 billion and $4.23 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash flows in 2011 reflected an increase in losses paid related to catastrophes and ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs), a higher level of contributions to the Company's qualified domestic pension plan and lower receipts related to net investment income as compared with 2010. These factors were partially offset by a higher level of collected premiums, a lower level of paid operating expenses and a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff. Cash flows in 2010 reflected a higher level of claims and claim adjustment expense payments due to the impact of loss cost trends and a higher level of catastrophe loss payments, as well as a lower level of reinsurance recoveries, partially offset by declines in the amount of contributions to the Company's qualified domestic pension plan and lower claims and claim adjustment expense payments related to operations in runoff as compared with 2009. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company contributed $185 million, $35 million and $260 million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension plan. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities were $1.15 billion and $2.11 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of $899 million in 2009. The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2011 decreased by $21 million from year-end 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of the Company's common share repurchases of $2.90 billion under its share repurchase authorization and shareholder dividends of $665 million, largely \n\noffset by operating cash flows of $2.17 billion and a $1.57 billion increase in net pretax unrealized appreciation of investments. \n\nOn June 17, 2011, the Company acquired 43% of the common stock of J. Malucelli Participa&#231;&#245;es em Seguros e Resseguros S.A, a Brazilian company (\"JMalucelli\"). JMalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in Brazil based on market share. The Company's investment was approximately $410 million in U.S. dollars, which was funded with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the Company. The Company has an option to increase its interest in JMalucelli up to 49.9% within 18 months from the date of the consummation of the transaction. \n\nThe primary goals of the Company's asset&#151;liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $3.31 billion, $5.22 billion and $3.44 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The totals in each year reflected common share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and the repayment of debt, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option exercises and, in 2010 and 2009, the issuance of debt. \n\nDebt Transactions. \n\n2011. On June 1, 2011, the Company repaid the remaining $9 million principal balance on its 7.22% real estate non-recourse debt. \n\n2010. On November 1, 2010, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount 3.90% senior notes that will mature on November 1, 2020, and $750 million aggregate principal amount 5.35% senior notes that will mature on November 1, 2040. The net proceeds of these issuances, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, were approximately $496 million and $738 million, respectively. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on November 1 and May 1 of each year. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points for the 2020 senior notes and 20 basis points for the 2040 notes. \n\nPrior to November 2010, the Company was subject to a replacement capital covenant that it had granted to the holders of its 6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 (the senior notes). The replacement capital covenant restricted the Company's ability to repurchase its $1.00 billion in outstanding 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 (the debentures). In November 2010, the Company paid approximately $4 million to holders of the senior notes to terminate the replacement capital covenant. Following the termination, the Company purchased approximately $885 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures. A $60 million pretax loss was recognized in 2010 related to these transactions. \n\nOn September 16, 2010, the Company repaid the remaining $4 million principal balance on its 7.81% private placement senior notes. On August 23, 2010, the Company's $21 million, 7.415% medium-term notes matured and were fully paid. On April 15, 2010, the Company's $250 million, 8.125% senior notes matured and were fully paid. All of these debt payments were made from internally-generated funds. \n\n2009. On June 2, 2009, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% senior notes that will mature on June 2, 2019. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, were approximately $494 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 2 and December 2 of each year. The senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined) plus 35 basis points. \n\nOn March 3, 2009, the Company's zero coupon convertible notes with an effective yield of 4.17% and a remaining principal balance of $141 million matured and were fully paid. \n\nThe amounts of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that becomes due in 2012 and 2013 are $250 million and $500 million, respectively. In 2014, no debt obligations become due. \n\nDividends. Dividends paid to shareholders were $665 million, $673 million and $693 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On January 24, 2012, the Company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, payable March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2012. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be at the discretion of the Company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. \n\nShare Repurchases. The Company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors. The following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2011 and remaining repurchase capacity at December 31, 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START Quarterly Period Ending (in millions, except per share amounts) \n\n&#160; Number of shares purchased &#160; Cost of shares repurchased &#160; Average price paid per share &#160; Remaining capacity under share repurchase authorization &#160; March 31, 2011 &#160; &#160; 18.9 &#160; $ 1,100 &#160; $ 58.23 &#160; $ 5,409 &#160; June 30, 2011 &#160; &#160; 3.9 &#160; &#160; 237 &#160; &#160; 60.27 &#160; &#160; 5,172 &#160; September 30, 2011 &#160; &#160; 7.3 &#160; &#160; 375 &#160; &#160; 51.77 &#160; &#160; 4,797 &#160; December 31, 2011 &#160; &#160; 20.9 &#160; &#160; 1,188 &#160; &#160; 56.74 &#160; &#160; 3,609 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 51.0 &#160; $ 2,900 &#160; $ 56.86 &#160; $ 3,609 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFrom the inception of the first authorization in May 2006 through December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased a cumulative total of 340.0 million shares for a total cost of $17.39 billion, or an average of $51.16 per share. \n\nIn 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company acquired 1.4 million, 1.3 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options. \n\nConversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. In May 2011, the Company's board of directors authorized the redemption of the Company's preferred stock held by The Travelers 401(k) Savings Plan (the Savings Plan) and gave notice of that redemption to the appropriate fiduciaries of the Savings Plan. Following a fiduciary review, the Savings Plan exercised its right to convert each preferred share into eight shares of the Company's common stock. As a result, all preferred shares outstanding on June 7, 2011 (190,083 shares) were converted into a total of 1.52 million shares of the Company's common stock. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nCapital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company's capital structure at December 31, 2011 and 2010. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; Debt: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; $ 350 &#160; $ 109 &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; 6,269 &#160; &#160; 6,519 &#160; Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs &#160; &#160; (14 ) &#160; (17 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total debt &#160; &#160; 6,605 &#160; &#160; 6,611 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Preferred shareholders' equity &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 68 &#160; Common shareholders' equity: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock &#160; &#160; 22,472 &#160; &#160; 24,152 &#160; Accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources &#160; &#160; 2,005 &#160; &#160; 1,255 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total shareholders' equity &#160; &#160; 24,477 &#160; &#160; 25,475 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total capitalization &#160; $ 31,082 &#160; $ 32,086 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $1.00 billion decrease in total capitalization from December 31, 2010 primarily reflected the impact of common share repurchases under the Company's share repurchase authorization of $2.90 billion and shareholder dividends of $669 million, partially offset by net income of $1.43 billion and a $1.01 billion increase in net unrealized appreciation on investments. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table. \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, dollars in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; Total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments &#160; $ 28,211 &#160; $ 30,227 &#160; Net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes &#160; &#160; 2,871 &#160; &#160; 1,859 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total capitalization &#160; $ 31,082 &#160; $ 32,086 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Debt-to-total capital ratio &#160; &#160; 21.3 % &#160; 20.6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments &#160; &#160; 23.4 % &#160; 21.9 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company's financial leverage position. The Company's debt-to-total capital ratio of 23.4% at December 31, 2011 calculated on this basis was within the Company's target range. \n\nLine of Credit Agreement. The Company is party to a three-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in June 2013. Pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the Company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (generally defined as shareholders' equity plus certain trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities, reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets) of $14.35 billion. The Company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. In addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include the acquisition of 35% or more of the Company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the Company's board of directors. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from LIBOR plus 100 basis points to LIBOR plus 175 basis points depending on the Company's credit ratings. At December 31, 2011, that cost would have been LIBOR plus 125 basis points had there been any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement. This line of credit also supports the Company's commercial paper program. \n\nShelf Registration. In December 2011, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities to replace the Company's previous registration statement that had expired in the normal course of business. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering. During 2010, the Company issued securities with a principal amount of $1.25 billion under the prior shelf registration statement. \n\nShare Repurchase Authorization. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $3.61 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2011, the Company's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim-related payments. The table excludes short-term obligations and includes only liabilities at December 31, 2011 that are expected to be settled in cash. \n\nThe table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing \n\nare frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty. \n\nThe contractual obligations related to debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, long-term unfunded investment commitments, estimated claims and claim-related payments (gross of the estimated reinsurance recoveries) and liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, at December 31, 2011 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; Debt &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Senior notes &#160; $ 6,150 &#160; $ 250 &#160; $ 500 &#160; $ 800 &#160; $ 4,600 &#160; Junior subordinated debentures &#160; &#160; 369 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 369 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total debt principal &#160; &#160; 6,519 &#160; &#160; 250 &#160; &#160; 500 &#160; &#160; 800 &#160; &#160; 4,969 &#160; Interest &#160; &#160; 5,562 &#160; &#160; 375 &#160; &#160; 698 &#160; &#160; 651 &#160; &#160; 3,838 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total long-term debt obligations(1) &#160; &#160; 12,081 &#160; &#160; 625 &#160; &#160; 1,198 &#160; &#160; 1,451 &#160; &#160; 8,807 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating leases(2) &#160; &#160; 520 &#160; &#160; 143 &#160; &#160; 203 &#160; &#160; 133 &#160; &#160; 41 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Purchase obligations &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Information systems administration and maintenance commitments(3) &#160; &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Reinsurance brokerage commitment(4) &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Other purchase commitments(5) &#160; &#160; 126 &#160; &#160; 78 &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total purchase obligations &#160; &#160; 160 &#160; &#160; 109 &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Long-term unfunded investment commitments(6) &#160; &#160; 1,154 &#160; &#160; 255 &#160; &#160; 344 &#160; &#160; 366 &#160; &#160; 189 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Estimated claims and claim-related payments &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expenses(7) &#160; &#160; 49,388 &#160; &#160; 10,766 &#160; &#160; 12,906 &#160; &#160; 7,397 &#160; &#160; 18,319 &#160; Claims from large deductible policies(8) &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Loss-based assessments(9) &#160; &#160; 201 &#160; &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; 46 &#160; &#160; 20 &#160; &#160; 99 &#160; Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits(10) &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Payout from ceded funds withheld(11) &#160; &#160; 282 &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; 120 &#160; &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; 101 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total estimated claims and claim-related payments &#160; &#160; 49,872 &#160; &#160; 10,832 &#160; &#160; 13,072 &#160; &#160; 7,449 &#160; &#160; 18,519 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits(12) &#160; &#160; 356 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; 356 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; $ 64,143 &#160; $ 11,964 &#160; $ 15,189 &#160; $ 9,406 &#160; $ 27,584 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See note 8 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding indebtedness.

(3) Includes agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services. (4) In connection with the sale of its insurance brokerage operations, the Company committed to acquire brokerage services from the buyer through May 16, 2012. \n\n(5) Includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and services including property, plant and equipment, office supplies, archival services, etc. (6) Represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships. (7) The amounts in \"Claims and claim adjustment expenses\" in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies. The Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note 5 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. In order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance (see below). The assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities. Reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in \"Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits\" in the table above. The estimated future cash inflows from the Company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; &#160; Reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 7,453 &#160; $ 1,420 &#160; $ 1,770 &#160; $ 1,189 &#160; $ 3,074 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expense on a net of reinsurance basis. The estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expenses, net &#160; $ 41,935 &#160; $ 9,346 &#160; $ 11,136 &#160; $ 6,208 &#160; $ 15,245 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2011. The amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. (See note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements.) (8) Workers' compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. \"Claims from large deductible \n\npolicies\" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as \"contractholder payables\" and \"contractholder receivables,\" respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within \"Claims and claim adjustment expenses\" in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table. \n\nThe estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers' compensation policies is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; 3-5 Years &#160; After 5 Years &#160; &#160; Contractholder payables/receivables &#160; $ 5,186 &#160; $ 1,247 &#160; $ 1,407 &#160; $ 777 &#160; $ 1,755 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(9) The amounts in \"Loss-based assessments\" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. For loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in \"other liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet. (10) The amounts in \"Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits\" represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits. Amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in \"other liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting. (11) The amounts in \"Payout from ceded funds withheld\" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the Company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held. (12) The Company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $356 million. Offsetting these liabilities are deferred tax assets of $324 million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized. \n\nThe above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company is not currently subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table. \n\nDividend Availability \n\nThe Company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of Connecticut. The insurance holding company laws of Connecticut applicable to the Company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. \n\nThe insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company's subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $1.96 billion is available by the end of 2012 for such dividends without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2012 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2012, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department. The holding company received $2.33 billion of dividends from its domestic insurance subsidiaries in 2011. \n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory pension plan (the Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly compensated employees and also sponsors a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees. \n\nThe Qualified Plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan for 2012 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2013. The Company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements. The Company made discretionary contributions to the Qualified Plan of $185 million, $35 million, and $260 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In determining future contributions, the Company considers the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the Company's other capital requirements. The Company has not determined whether or not additional discretionary funding will be made in the current year or beyond. However, the Company currently believes, subject to actual plan performance and funded status at the time, that it may make discretionary pension contributions of approximately $75 million to $100 million annually over the next few years. \n\nThe Qualified Plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return. The Company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. For 2012, the Company plans to apply an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50%, down from 8.00% in 2011. The reduction reflects the Company's current expectations of long-term returns on the plan's invested assets, taking into account the current low level of long-term interest rates as well as the Federal Reserve's commentary in January 2012 regarding expected interest rate levels through 2014, and projecting a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future. \n\nFor further discussion of the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans, see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nRisk-Based Capital \n\nThe NAIC adopted RBC requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action. The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the RBC requirements. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At December 31, 2011, all of the Company's insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nThe Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications, including those related to the sale of business entities. See note 15 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the Company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments. \n\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves \n\nGross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; Case &#160; IBNR &#160; Total &#160; Case &#160; IBNR &#160; Total &#160; General liability &#160; $ 5,571 &#160; $ 9,657 &#160; $ 15,228 &#160; $ 5,809 &#160; $ 10,449 &#160; $ 16,258 &#160; Property &#160; &#160; 1,025 &#160; &#160; 643 &#160; &#160; 1,668 &#160; &#160; 945 &#160; &#160; 627 &#160; &#160; 1,572 &#160; Commercial multi-peril &#160; &#160; 2,153 &#160; &#160; 1,792 &#160; &#160; 3,945 &#160; &#160; 1,897 &#160; &#160; 1,766 &#160; &#160; 3,663 &#160; Commercial automobile(1) &#160; &#160; 2,388 &#160; &#160; 1,121 &#160; &#160; 3,509 &#160; &#160; 2,302 &#160; &#160; 1,060 &#160; &#160; 3,362 &#160; Workers' compensation &#160; &#160; 9,649 &#160; &#160; 7,348 &#160; &#160; 16,997 &#160; &#160; 9,447 &#160; &#160; 7,082 &#160; &#160; 16,529 &#160; Fidelity and surety &#160; &#160; 500 &#160; &#160; 1,029 &#160; &#160; 1,529 &#160; &#160; 542 &#160; &#160; 1,124 &#160; &#160; 1,666 &#160; Personal automobile(1) &#160; &#160; 2,038 &#160; &#160; 736 &#160; &#160; 2,774 &#160; &#160; 1,863 &#160; &#160; 935 &#160; &#160; 2,798 &#160; Homeowners and personal&#151;other &#160; &#160; 778 &#160; &#160; 814 &#160; &#160; 1,592 &#160; &#160; 653 &#160; &#160; 769 &#160; &#160; 1,422 &#160; International and other &#160; &#160; 2,370 &#160; &#160; 1,741 &#160; &#160; 4,111 &#160; &#160; 2,353 &#160; &#160; 1,914 &#160; &#160; 4,267 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Property-casualty &#160; &#160; 26,472 &#160; &#160; 24,881 &#160; &#160; 51,353 &#160; &#160; 25,811 &#160; &#160; 25,726 &#160; &#160; 51,537 &#160; Accident and health &#160; &#160; 58 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; 66 &#160; &#160; 61 &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; 69 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves &#160; $ 26,530 &#160; $ 24,889 &#160; $ 51,419 &#160; $ 25,872 &#160; $ 25,734 &#160; $ 51,606 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes impact from certain reclassifications made to 2010 amounts to conform to 2011 presentation. \n\nThe $187 million decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2010 primarily reflected the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development and payments related to operations in runoff, including asbestos and environmental claims, partially offset by the significant catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and growth in business volume. \n\nAsbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\", \"Environmental Claims and Litigation\" and \"Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.\" \n\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR). Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates are \n\nexpectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and subrogation. Estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in \"Reinsurance Recoverables\" as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. \n\nThe process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. The Company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded&#151;favorable or unfavorable. \n\nBecause establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. \n\nThere are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge. \n\nA portion of the Company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $3.13 billion at December 31, 2011) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the \n\nCompany's future operating results. See the preceding discussion of \"Asbestos Claims and Litigation\" and \"Environmental Claims and Litigation.\" \n\nGeneral Discussion \n\nThe process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. \n\nMultiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. \n\nIn most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate. \n\nThe exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. \n\nProperty-casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later. \n\nMost general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics, among others. \n\nA basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the \n\nparticular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. \n\nInformed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult. \n\nThe variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. \n\nProduct lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. \n\nA major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. \n\nFor some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being \"low frequency/high severity,\" while lines without this \"large claim\" sensitivity are referred to as \"high frequency/low severity.\" Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable. \n\nClaim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. \n\nActuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. \n\nLastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization. \n\nRisk factors \n\nThe major causes of material uncertainty (\"risk factors\") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently. \n\nSome risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. \n\nThe effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. \n\nThe evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. \n\nWhile some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. \n\nSudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. \n\nActuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves \n\nThe principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company's actuaries are the paid development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method. The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. These are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (See Glossary for an explanation of these methods). \n\nWhile these are the principal methods utilized throughout the Company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The Company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates. \n\nSome components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. In such cases, the Company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. The reserves excluding such large \n\nclaims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as: \n\n&#149; Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available. &#149; Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.) &#149; Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis. &#149; Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental). The results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development based on the prior review. Additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods. \n\nThe methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. Hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate. \n\nManagement's estimates \n\nAt least once per quarter, certain Company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. \n\nSuch an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform. This is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company's estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. \n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves. \n\nDiscussion of Product Lines \n\nThe following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. \n\nIn order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year period are provided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of SPC or TPC. This treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available. \n\nGeneral Liability \n\nGeneral liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7 years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for \"construction defect\" claims). \n\nWhile the majority of general liability coverages are written on an \"occurrence\" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are typically insured on a \"claims-made\" basis. \n\nGeneral liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. In addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect, medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods. \n\nDefense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. Such \"defense within the limits\" policies are most common for \"claims-made\" products. When defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits. \n\nThis line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the \"event\" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure). \n\nThe amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect, medical malpractice and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics. \n\nIn addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and S-curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred development methods. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nGeneral liability risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in claim handling philosophies &#149; Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions &#149; New theories of liability &#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues 135 \n\n&#149; Changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim &#149; Changes in statutes of limitations &#149; Changes in the underlying court system &#149; Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues &#149; Changes in tort law &#149; Shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts &#149; Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) &#149; Changes in settlement patterns (e.g., medical malpractice) General liability book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from -8% to 14% (averaging 1%) for the Company and from -5% to 7% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Because the high end of the Company's range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the Company has since exited, the Company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 25% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was -8% for 2011, -5% for 2010 and -5% for 2009. The 2011 change was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2005-2008 and reflected what the Company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected. The 2010 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior and reflected what the Company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the Company previously expected. The 2009 change was driven by several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. \n\nProperty \n\nProperty is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. \n\nProperty reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nProperty risk factors \n\n&#149; Physical concentration of policyholders &#149; Availability and cost of local contractors &#149; For the more severe catastrophic events, \"demand surge\" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services &#149; Local building codes &#149; Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) &#149; Frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed &#149; Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) &#149; Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) &#149; Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations Property book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -34% to 26% (averaging -13%) for the Company, and from -14% to 7% (averaging -7%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Because the high end of the Company's range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the Company has since exited, the Company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nSince property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of September 11, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -5% for 2011, -25% for 2010 and -9% for 2009. The 2011 change primarily reflected better than expected development in the 2008 and 2009 accident years for certain large national property and ocean marine exposures. The 2010 change primarily occurred in the 2008 and 2009 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development in Industry-Focused Underwriting and Target Risk Underwriting. The 2009 change was primarily driven by better than expected loss development in the 2007 and 2008 accident years for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. In addition, the 2005 accident year experience improved due to the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. \n\nCommercial Multi-Peril \n\nCommercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. \n\nThe reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and property includes larger customers. \n\nSee \"Property risk factors\" and \"General liability risk factors,\" discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril. \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -16% to 3% (averaging -5%) for the Company, and from -5% to 6% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nAs discussed above, this line combines general liability and property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2011, 0% for 2010 and -8% for 2009. The 2011 change reflected unfavorable loss development driven by late reporting of hail claims incurred in 2010. The 2009 change was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, and enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. Also contributing to the change was improvement in the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, Hurricane Katrina. \n\nCommercial Automobile \n\nThe commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take \n\nlonger to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nCommercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. \n\nThe Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors \n\n&#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the underlying court system &#149; Changes in case law &#149; Litigation trends &#149; Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits &#149; Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents &#149; Changes in auto safety technology &#149; Subrogation opportunities &#149; Changes in claim handling philosophies &#149; Frequency of visits to health providers &#149; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers &#149; Types of health providers used &#149; Types of medical treatments received &#149; Changes in cost of medical treatments &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Commercial automobile book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) &#149; Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -10% to 5% (averaging -3%) for the Company, and from -3% to 5% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 5% for 2011, -1% for 2010 and -6% for 2009. The 2011 change reflected worse than expected severity for the 2009 and 2010 accident years. The 2009 change was a result of better than expected loss development, primarily for recent accident years, which was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, and enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. \n\nWorkers' Compensation \n\nWorkers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk. \n\nWorkers' compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nIndemnity risk factors \n\n&#149; Time required to recover from the injury &#149; Degree of available transitional jobs &#149; Degree of legal involvement &#149; Changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers' compensation commissions' oversight of claims(1) &#149; Future wage inflation for states that index benefits &#149; Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds Medical risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (\"inflation\") \n\n(1) These are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers' compensation benefits is valid. Their duties include the determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist. 140 \n\n&#149; Frequency of visits to health providers &#149; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers &#149; Types of health providers used &#149; Type of medical treatments received &#149; Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices &#149; Availability of new medical processes and equipment &#149; Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment General workers' compensation risk factors \n\n&#149; Frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed &#149; Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment &#149; Degree of cost shifting between workers' compensation and health insurance Workers' compensation book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Product mix &#149; Injury type mix &#149; Changes in underwriting standards Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers' compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -1% to 2% (averaging 0%) for the Company, and from -1% to 4% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Workers' compensation reserves represent approximately 33% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% in 2011, -1% in 2010 and -1% for 2009. \n\nFidelity and Surety \n\nFidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas, the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies. \n\nSurety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (Large construction projects can take many years to complete.) The frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured contractor to fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection and adherence to underwriting standards. The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured's assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nFidelity risk factors \n\n&#149; Type of business of insured &#149; Policy limit and attachment points &#149; Third-party claims &#149; Coverage litigation &#149; Complexity of claims &#149; Growth in insureds' operations Surety risk factors \n\n&#149; Economic trends, including the general level of construction activity &#149; Concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims &#149; Type of business insured &#149; Type of obligation insured &#149; Cumulative limits of liability for insured &#149; Assets available to mitigate loss &#149; Defective workmanship/latent defects &#149; Financial strategy of insured &#149; Changes in statutory obligations &#149; Geographic spread of business Fidelity and Surety book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards 142 \n\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -11% to 138% (averaging 14%) for the Company, and from -13% to 24% (averaging 4%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. Because the high end of the Company's range was due to acquired business in 2004, the Company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nIn general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -11% for 2011, -6% for 2010 and -7% for 2009. The 2011 change primarily reflected better than expected development for accident years 2008 and prior for the contract surety business. The 2010 change was driven by better than expected loss development due to lower than expected claim activity and loss severity, primarily for the contract surety business in this product line for the 2008 and prior accident years. The 2009 change was a result of better than expected loss development for the contract surety business within this product line, primarily driven by favorable settlements on large claims from older accident years. \n\nPersonal Automobile \n\nPersonal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \n\nPersonal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: \n\nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors \n\n&#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy &#149; Changes in case law &#149; Litigation trends &#149; Frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits &#149; Change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents 143 \n\n&#149; Subrogation opportunities &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment &#149; Changes in claim handling philosophies No-fault risk factors (for selected states and time periods) \n\n&#149; Effectiveness of no-fault laws &#149; Frequency of visits to health providers &#149; Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers &#149; Types of health providers used &#149; Types of medical treatments received &#149; Changes in cost of medical treatments &#149; Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment Personal automobile book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -9% to 3% (averaging -3%) for the Company, and from -4% to 0% (averaging -2%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Personal automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2011, 0% for 2010 and 0% for 2009. The 2011 change reflected worse than expected severity for the 2007 - 2010 accident years. \n\nHomeowners and Personal Lines Other \n\nHomeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. \n\nThe liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. In addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future. \n\nOverall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. \n\nHomeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nNon-catastrophe risk factors \n\n&#149; Salvage opportunities &#149; Amount of time to return property to residential use &#149; Changes in weather patterns &#149; Local building codes &#149; Litigation trends &#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) &#149; Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) &#149; Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations Catastrophe risk factors \n\n&#149; Physical concentration of policyholders &#149; Availability and cost of local contractors &#149; Local building codes &#149; Quality of construction of damaged homes &#149; Amount of time to return property to residential use &#149; For the more severe catastrophic events, \"demand surge\" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services Homeowners book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) &#149; Degree of concentration of policyholders &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Changes in the use of credit data for rating and underwriting Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from -31% to 3% (averaging -12%) for the \n\nCompany, and from -8% to 11% (averaging -3%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nThis line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. \n\nThe Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was -7% for 2011, 2% for 2010 and -14% for 2009. The Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line including the umbrella line of business was -11% for 2011, -4% for 2010 and -12% for 2009. The 2011 change reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in the first half of 2010, as well as better than expected loss development in the 2006 - 2010 accident years for the umbrella line of business. The 2010 change reflected favorable loss development in the 2008 and prior accident years, primarily for the umbrella line of business, partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the 2009 accident year for the homeowners' line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated late-reported claims related to storms in 2009. The 2009 change primarily reflected favorable loss development related to Hurricanes Ike and Katrina, as well as the 2007 California wildfires. \n\nInternational and other \n\nInternational and other includes products written by International and other products not discussed above. The principal component of \"other\" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff business. \n\nInternational and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. \n\nDue to changes in the business mix for this line over time, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes. \n\nInternational and other reserves are generally analyzed by program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g., U.S. Liability&#151;excess of loss reinsurance, or General Liability&#151;Municipalities&#151;by country). The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage/jurisdiction. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the General Liability and Property discussion \n\nabove, provided that reserves relating to insured hazards outside the United States are analyzed taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions, including, for example and where applicable, that in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages. Where the underlying hazard is within the U.S., the coverage involved is typically that of General Liability and Property, but on an excess or excess-of-loss reinsurance basis. Excess exposure requires the insured to \"prove\" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy's attachment point. \n\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \n\nInternational and other risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers &#149; Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision &#149; New theories of liability &#149; Trends in jury awards &#149; Changes in the propensity to sue &#149; Changes in statutes of limitations &#149; Changes in the underlying court system &#149; Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues &#149; Changes in tort law &#149; Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) International and other book of business risk factors \n\n&#149; Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, \"claims-made\" language) &#149; Changes in underwriting standards &#149; Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) Unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 8% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. \n\nInternational and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the U.S. do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other. \n\nReinsurance Recoverables \n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables: \n\n##TABLE_START (at December 31, in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; 2010 &#160; Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses &#160; $ 6,216 &#160; $ 6,934 &#160; Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance &#160; &#160; (345 ) &#160; (363 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net reinsurance recoverables &#160; &#160; 5,871 &#160; &#160; 6,571 &#160; Mandatory pools and associations(1) &#160; &#160; 2,020 &#160; &#160; 2,043 &#160; Structured settlements(2) &#160; &#160; 3,291 &#160; &#160; 3,380 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total reinsurance recoverables &#160; $ 11,182 &#160; $ 11,994 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes impact from certain reclassifications made to 2010 amounts to conform to 2011 presentation. (2) Included in the Company's reinsurance recoverables are certain structured settlements issued by Fidelity &#38; Guaranty Life, which was previously a subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. prior to being sold by its U.K. parent company to Harbinger Group Inc. and being renamed. \n\nThe $700 million decline in net reinsurance recoverables since December 31, 2010 reflected cash collections and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development. \n\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. \n\nThe reinsurance agreements that the Company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts and meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The Company's catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in \"Item 1&#151;Business&#151;Catastrophe Reinsurance.\" \n\nThe Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the Company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges. \n\nRecoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers' compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating \n\ninsurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally. \n\nOn August 20, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned United States Fidelity &#38; Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al., the trial court granted summary judgment for United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&#38;G), a subsidiary of the Company, and on October 25, 2010, entered judgment against American Re-Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Munich Re (American Re) and three other reinsurers, awarding USF&#38;G $251 million plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $169 million. The judgment, including the award of interest, was appealed to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. On January 24, 2012, the Appellate Division affirmed the judgment, which, as of that date, totaled $467 million, comprising the judgment of $251 million and interest of $216 million (including post-judgment interest). Post-judgment interest continues to accrue (without compounding) at the rate of 9% until the judgment is paid. On January 30, 2012, the reinsurers filed a motion with the Appellate Division seeking permission to appeal its decision to the New York Court of Appeals. Whether the Appellate Division grants permission to appeal is within its discretion. The $251 million awarded by the court represents the amount owed to USF&#38;G under the terms of the disputed reinsurance agreements and is reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The interest awarded by the Court, including post-judgment interest, is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with FASB Topic 450, Contingencies, and accordingly has not been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements. \n\nInvestment Valuation and Impairments \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: \n\n&#151; Level 1&#151;Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. &#151; Level 2&#151;Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data. &#151; Level 3&#151;Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use. Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements \n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a \n\nforced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. \n\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service (pricing service). When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value, which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments. The fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. If quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as Level 2 or Level 3. The Company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction. \n\nFixed Maturities \n\nThe Company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities. The pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Additionally, the pricing service uses an Option Adjusted Spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. \n\nThe pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. The market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. For some securities, additional inputs may be necessary. \n\nThe pricing service utilized by the Company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. If the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the Company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for market-based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions. \n\nThe fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices. \n\nThe Company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the Company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market. In addition, the Company has periodic discussions with the \n\npricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets. The Company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%. The Company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value. In addition, the Company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). The Company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio. These processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service. \n\nThe Company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. The underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the U.S. Treasury curve are the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index and the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield BB Rated Index. The Company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in Level 2, since all significant inputs are market observable. \n\nWhile the vast majority of the Company's municipal bonds are included in Level 2, the Company holds a small number of municipal bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (typically a market maker). Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3. \n\nNon-Fixed Maturities and Other Investments Not Reported at Fair Value \n\nSee note 4 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of non-fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements. \n\nInvestment Impairments \n\nThe Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. Some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1) for fixed maturity investments, whether the Company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2) for non-fixed maturity investments, the Company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e., whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices. \n\nReporting of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments \n\nFor fixed maturity investments that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, \n\nthe Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). The impairment related to all other factors is reported in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources. \n\nFor non-fixed maturity investments and for fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses). \n\nUpon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment. \n\nDue to the subjective nature of the Company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods. \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of investment impairments. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairments \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nOTHER UNCERTAINTIES \n\nFor a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see note 15 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors.\" \n\nFUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nSee note 1 of notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards updates. \n\nThe Company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). During the last several years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been evaluating whether, when and how International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) should be incorporated into the U.S. financial reporting system. Before making a decision, the SEC is completing its work plan to evaluate the remaining differences between GAAP and IFRS and examine the variations in the way IFRS was applied by various foreign companies that file financial statements with the SEC. In December 2011, the SEC staff provided an update of its progress but declined to provide a timetable for completing its analysis and making a recommendation. \n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the FASB continue to work on a joint project to develop a global insurance standard that involves methodologies for valuing insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by current \n\nGAAP. The FASB and the IASB have also embarked on a long-term project to converge GAAP and IFRS. The Company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt IFRS or how the adoption of IFRS (or the convergence of GAAP and IFRS, including the joint project for valuing insurance contract liabilities) may impact the Company's financial statements in the future. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report contains, and management may make, certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
