These items collectively had a $0.06 net benefit on EPS. \n\nNet income attributable to Disney for fiscal 2011 included $55 million of restructuring and impairment charges and gains from the sales of businesses of $75 million. These items collectively had a $0.02 net negative impact on EPS. The table below shows the pretax and after tax impact of these items. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Benefit / (Expense) &#160; &#160; &#160; Pretax &#160; &#160; Tax Effect &#160; &#160; After Tax &#160; Restructuring and impairment charges \n\n&#160; $ &#160;(55) &#160; &#160; $ 47 &#160; &#160; $ &#160;(8) &#160; Gains on sales of businesses \n\n&#160; &#160; 75 &#160; &#160; &#160; (107) &#160; &#160; &#160; (32) &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; $ 20 &#160; &#160; $ (60) &#160; &#160; $ (40) &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Restructuring and impairment charges included an impairment of assets that had tax basis significantly in excess of book value resulting in a $47 million tax benefit on the restructuring and impairment charges. The gains on sales of businesses included the sale of Miramax which had a book value that included $217 million of allocated goodwill which is not tax deductible. Accordingly, the taxable gain on the sales of businesses exceeded the $75 million book gain resulting in tax expense of $107 million. \n\nAfter the impact of the items discussed above, the increase in EPS for fiscal 2012 reflected higher operating results driven by higher fees from MVPDs (Affiliate Fees) at ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel, higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN, higher results at our theatrical business driven by Marvel&#146;s The Avengers , higher ABC program sales, improved social game performance due to lower acquisition accounting impacts and increased title performance, and higher merchandise licensing revenue driven by the strength of Marvel properties. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses at our domestic parks and resorts, higher sports programming costs at ESPN, lower advertising revenue at ABC and our owned television stations and higher film cost write-downs. \n\n2011 vs. 2010 \n\nRevenues for fiscal 2011 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $40.9 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 21%, or $844 million, to $4.8 billion; and EPS increased 24% to $2.52. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe increase in EPS for fiscal 2011 reflected higher operating results driven by Affiliate Fee growth at our Cable Networks, increased guest spending and volumes at our domestic parks and resorts, higher advertising revenue at ESPN and lower film cost write-downs. Additionally, EPS growth benefited from decreased programming and production costs at ABC, higher licensing revenue due to the strength of Cars merchandise and a full-period of results for Marvel, and higher equity income at AETN. These increases were partially offset by higher costs at ESPN and at our domestic parks and resorts, lower performance at our theatrical business, and the inclusion of a full-period of results for Playdom in fiscal 2011, which included the impact of acquisition accounting. \n\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges \n\nThe Company recorded $100 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2012. Restructuring charges were driven by severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses. Impairment charges primarily resulted from an intellectual property impairment. \n\nThe Company recorded $55 million of charges in fiscal 2011 reflecting severance and facilities costs related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at the Studio Entertainment and Interactive segments. \n\nThe Company recorded $270 million of charges in fiscal 2010 related to organizational and cost structure initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million were primarily for severance and other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. \n\nOther Income /(expense), net \n\nOther income /(expense) is as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; UTV Gain \n\n&#160; $ 184 &#160; &#160; $ &#160;&#151; &#160; &#160; $ &#160;&#151; &#160; Lehman recovery \n\n&#160; &#160; 79 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; DLP debt charge \n\n&#160; &#160; (24) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain on sale of Miramax \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 64 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain on sale of BASS \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; Gain on sales of investments in television services in Europe \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 75 &#160; Gain on sale of Power Rangers property \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 43 &#160; Gain related to the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan \n\n&#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; &#160; 22 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Other income /(expense), net \n\n&#160; $ 239 &#160; &#160; $ 75 &#160; &#160; $ 140 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS &#151; 2012 vs. 2011 \n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments.

The increase at Cable Networks reflected an increase of 6% due to higher rates. The decrease at Broadcasting reflected decreases of 7% due to lower ABC ratings, and 2% due to lower local television advertising driven by lower political advertising, partially offset by an increase of 5% due to higher ABC advertising rates. \n\nThe increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher program sales driven by Castle, Once Upon a Time, and Revenge , partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues, primarily due to Lost , and lower Disney Channel program sales. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $231 million from $8,760 million to $8,991 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production costs of $359 million was primarily due to higher sports rights costs due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, MLB, and NBA programming and expanded rights for the Wimbledon Championships. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $128 million reflecting the absence of The Oprah Winfrey Show at our local television stations and lower program write-offs at ABC. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nIncome from equity investees increased to $627 million in the current year from $584 million in the prior year driven by an increase at AETN primarily due to higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. This increase was partially offset by equity losses at Hulu which were driven by higher programming and marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and subscription revenues. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 8%, or $473 million, to $6.6 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channels, higher program sales, lower broadcast programming costs and increased equity income from AETN, partially offset by lower broadcast advertising revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; September 29, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 13,621 &#160; &#160; $ 12,877 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,815 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,837 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 19,436 &#160; &#160; $ 18,714 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Segment operating income \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 5,704 &#160; &#160; $ 5,233 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 915 &#160; &#160; &#160; 913 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 6,619 &#160; &#160; $ 6,146 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Restructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges of $14 million, $3 million and $95 million related to Media Networks for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily for severance related to organizational and cost structure initiatives. The charges in fiscal 2010 were for severance costs and the closure of five ESPN Zone locations. These charges were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nParks and Resorts \n\nOperating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; September 29, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 10,339 &#160; &#160; $ 9,302 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; International \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,581 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,495 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 12,920 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,797 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (7,928) &#160; &#160; &#160; (7,383) &#160; &#160; &#160; (7) % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,849) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,696) &#160; &#160; &#160; (9) % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,241) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,165) &#160; &#160; &#160; (7) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,902 &#160; &#160; $ 1,553 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nParks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1.1 billion, to $12.9 billion due to an increase of $1.0 billion at our domestic operations and an increase of $86 million at our international operations. \n\nRevenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 5% increase from higher average guest spending and a 5% increase from volume. Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, food and beverage spending, and daily hotel room rates. The volume increase was driven by higher passenger cruise days from the Disney Fantasy and the Disney Dream , which launched in March 2012 and January 2011, respectively, increased attendance at our domestic parks reflecting strong growth at Disneyland Resort which benefited from the opening of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure and higher hotel occupancy from Aulani, our new hotel and vacation club resort in Hawaii, which opened in August 2011. \n\nRevenue growth of 3% at our international operations reflected a 3% increase from higher average guest spending, a 3% increase from higher attendance and a 3% increase from higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4% from the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and a decrease of 1% from lower hotel occupancy at Disneyland Paris. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher daily hotel room rates and average ticket prices. Higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort reflected the prior-year impact from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Domestic &#160; &#160; International (2) &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2011 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2011 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2012 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2011 &#160; Parks \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Increase/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Attendance \n\n&#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; Per Capita Guest Spending \n\n&#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; Hotels (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Occupancy \n\n&#160; &#160; 81 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 82 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 85 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 88 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 82 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 83 % &#160; Available Room Nights \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; &#160; 9,850 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,625 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,468 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,466 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,318 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,091 &#160; Per Room Guest Spending \n\n&#160; $ 257 &#160; &#160; $ 241 &#160; &#160; $ 317 &#160; &#160; $ 294 &#160; &#160; $ 270 &#160; &#160; $ 253 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels.

The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.30 and $1.39 for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include operating labor which increased by $285 million from $3,540 million to $3,825 million and cost of sales which increased $96 million from $1,198 million to $1,294 million. Higher operating labor was driven by new guest offerings, labor cost inflation and higher employee benefit costs. The increase in cost of sales was driven by higher volumes. Operating expenses also increased due to costs associated with resort expansion and new guest offerings including investments in supporting systems infrastructure. New guest offerings included the Disney Fantasy and Disney Dream, and the expansion of Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. These increases were partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the collection of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the prior-year earthquake and tsunami in Japan. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by marketing for resort expansion and new guest offerings and labor and other cost inflation. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 22%, or $349 million, to $1.9 billion driven by increases at our domestic parks and resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; September 29, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 1, 2011 (1) &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Theatrical distribution \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,470 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 1,733 &#160; &#160; &#160; (15) % &#160; Home entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,221 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,435 &#160; &#160; &#160; (9) % &#160; Television distribution and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,134 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,183 &#160; &#160; &#160; (2) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,825 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,351 &#160; &#160; &#160; (8) % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,908) &#160; &#160; &#160; (3,253) &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,053) &#160; &#160; &#160; (2,348) &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (142) &#160; &#160; &#160; (132) &#160; &#160; &#160; (8) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 722 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 618 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nLower theatrical distribution revenues were driven by fewer releases, partially offset by the strong performance of Marvel&#146;s The Avengers. \n\nLower home entertainment revenue reflected a 12% decrease from a decline in unit sales reflecting lower catalog sales and the performance of the current-year titles. Significant titles in the current year included Marvel&#146;s The Avengers and Cars 2 while the prior year included Toy Story 3 and Tangled. The decrease was partially offset by a 2% increase due to higher net effective pricing domestically which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. \n\nThe decrease in television distribution and other revenue was driven by lower revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the prior-year performance of Cars merchandise. Television distribution revenue was comparable to the prior year as higher syndication sales in international markets was offset by lower sales in the domestic pay television market. \n\nCost and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a decrease of $200 million in film cost amortization, from $1,885 million to $1,685 million, driven by lower home entertainment sales volume and a lower average production cost amortization rate for television distribution sales, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold which decreased $145 million from $1,368 million to $1,223 million driven by a decline in home entertainment sales volume and fewer theatrical titles in release. \n\nThe decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to lower marketing expenses at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses driven by fewer major releases in the current year. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 17% to $722 million primarily due to improved results at our domestic theatrical and television distribution businesses, partially offset by higher film cost write-downs in the current year. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges of $18 million, $33 million and $151 million related to Studio Entertainment for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2012 were primarily due to an impairment of an intellectual property intangible asset. The charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily for severance and related costs. The charges in fiscal 2010 were primarily for the closure of a production facility, the write-offs of capitalized costs related to abandoned film projects, and severance costs. These charges were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nConsumer Products \n\nOperating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; September 29, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Licensing and publishing \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 2,056 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 1,933 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; Retail and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,196 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,252 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,049 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,384) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,334) &#160; &#160; &#160; (4) % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (816) &#160; &#160; &#160; (794) &#160; &#160; &#160; (3) % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (115) &#160; &#160; &#160; (105) &#160; &#160; &#160; (10) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 937 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 816 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe 6% increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a decreased revenue share with Studio Entertainment due to lower revenues from Cars merchandise, higher performance of Spider-Man, Minnie and Mickey and Avengers merchandise and higher recognition of minimum guarantees. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe 7% increase in retail and other revenue reflected growth at our retail business driven by new stores in North America and Europe, increased online sales due to promotional events, and higher comparable store sales in North America. These increases were partially offset by lower comparable store sales in Europe. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included an increase of $26 million in cost of goods sold, from $567 million to $593 million, driven by increased sales volume at our retail business. Operating expenses also increased 1% due to higher distribution costs driven by higher third-party royalties and 1% due to higher labor and occupancy costs driven by the expansion of the Disney English business in China and new retail stores in North America and Europe. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses was driven by higher marketing and promotions expense. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 15% to $937 million due to increases at our licensing and retail businesses. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $34 million and $16 million related to Consumer Products for fiscal years 2012 and 2010, respectively. The charges in fiscal 2012 and 2010 were primarily due to severance costs which were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nInteractive \n\nOperating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; September 29, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160;(1) &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Game sales and subscriptions \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 613 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 768 &#160; &#160; &#160; (20) % &#160; Advertising and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 232 &#160; &#160; &#160; 214 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 845 &#160; &#160; &#160; 982 &#160; &#160; &#160; (14) % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (583) &#160; &#160; &#160; (675) &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (429) &#160; &#160; &#160; (561) &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (49) &#160; &#160; &#160; (54) &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Loss \n\n&#160; &#160;$ (216) &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (308) &#160; &#160; &#160; 30 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation \n\n##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe decrease in game sales and subscriptions revenue reflected a 29% decrease from lower console game unit sales and a 8% decrease from lower net effective pricing of console games reflecting the strong performance of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean , Cars 2 and Epic Mickey in the prior-year period. The decrease was partially offset by an 11% increase from higher social games revenue reflecting improved title performance in the current period and lower acquisition accounting impacts. \n\nHigher advertising and other revenue was driven by an increase at our mobile phone service in Japan which included a benefit from higher rates. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a $21 million decrease in product development costs from $352 million to $331 million driven by decreased console game development. Operating expenses also include cost of sales, which decreased by $71 million from $323 million to $252 million driven by lower console game sales volume, partially offset by an increase at social games associated with revenue growth. \n\nThe decrease in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to lower marketing costs at our console games business driven by fewer releases in the current period, lower acquisition accounting expenses at our social games business, and higher cost allocations to other Company businesses related to website design and maintenance and online revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Operating Loss \n\nSegment operating loss decreased 30% to $216 million driven by improved results at our social games and online businesses partially offset by a decrease at our console games business. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\nThe Company recorded charges totaling $21 million, $22 million and $2 million related to Interactive for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively which were primarily for severance costs. These charges were reported in &#147;Restructuring and impairment charges&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nNON-SEGMENT ITEMS &#150; 2012 vs. 2011 \n\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 3%, from $459 million to $474 million due to higher compensation related costs and charitable contributions. \n\nNet Interest Expense \n\nNet interest expense is detailed below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; % Change Better/(Worse) &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160; $ (472) &#160; &#160; &#160; $ (435) &#160; &#160; &#160; (9)% &#160; Interest and investment income \n\n&#160; &#160; 103 &#160; &#160; &#160; 92 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Net interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160; $ (369) &#160; &#160; &#160; $ (343) &#160; &#160; &#160; (8)% &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The increase in interest expense reflected higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; Change Better/(Worse) &#160; Effective income tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 33.3 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 34.6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 1.3 ppt &#160; ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate decreased 1.3 percentage points for the year due to the impact in the prior-year of the gain on the sale of Miramax and an increase in earnings from foreign operations subject to tax at rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate. The book value of Miramax included non-deductible goodwill such that the taxable gain on the sale of Miramax resulted in tax expense that exceeded the book gain causing an increase in the prior-year effective tax rate. The decreases from the impacts of the Miramax gain and foreign earnings were partially offset by an increase due to the tax rate benefit in the prior-year related to an impairment charge. The prior-year impairment charge related to assets that had tax basis in excess of the book value resulting in a tax benefit that exceeded the pre-tax impairment charge causing a decrease in the prior-year effective tax rate. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $40 million to $491 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort partially offset by lower operating results at Disneyland Paris including the impact of the DLP debt charge. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. \n\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS \n\nPension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the Parks and Resorts segment. The Company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $626 million, $576 million, and $482 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2012 was driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan \n\n&#160; \n\nobligations. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed from a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. \n\nIn fiscal 2013, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by approximately $66 million to $692 million, including $458 million of recognition of net actuarial losses, driven by a lower assumed discount rate. Pension and postretirement medical costs for fiscal 2012 included $340 million of net actuarial losses. The decrease in the discount rate also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans to $4.8 billion and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $5.1 billion ($3.2 billion after tax) as of September 29, 2012. If our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, a significant portion of the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical costs will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 8 years. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements. During fiscal 2012, the Company contributed $905 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. The Company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2013 to total approximately $425 million to $475 million. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2013 will be determined based on our January 1, 2013 funding actuarial valuation which will be available in late fiscal 2013. See &#147;Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors&#148; for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs. \n\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS &#150; 2011 vs. 2010 \n\nMedia Networks \n\nOperating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended (1) &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Affiliate Fees \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 8,837 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 8,122 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; Advertising \n\n&#160; &#160; 7,598 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,028 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; Other \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,279 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,012 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 18,714 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17,162 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (10,282) &#160; &#160; &#160; (9,787) &#160; &#160; &#160; (5) % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,633) &#160; &#160; &#160; (2,459) &#160; &#160; &#160; (7) % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (237) &#160; &#160; &#160; (222) &#160; &#160; &#160; (7) % &#160; Equity in the income of investees \n\n&#160; &#160; 584 &#160; &#160; &#160; 438 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 6,146 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 5,132 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Certain reclassifications have been made to the numbers presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation \n\n##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nAffiliate Fee growth of 9% was driven by increases of 6% from higher contractual rates, 1% from favorable impacts of foreign currency translation, and 1% from subscriber growth at Cable Networks and an increase of 1% from Broadcasting due to new contractual provisions. \n\nHigher advertising revenues were due to an increase of $471 million at Cable Networks from $3,051 million to $3,522 million and an increase of $99 million at Broadcasting from $3,977 million to $4,076 million. The increase at Cable Networks of 14% was due to higher rates. The increase at Broadcasting reflected increases of 6% due to higher ABC advertising rates, primarily in primetime, and 1% due to higher local television advertising, partially offset by a decrease of 4% due to lower ABC ratings primarily in primetime and daytime. \n\nThe increase in other revenues was driven by a change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher sales of Disney Channel programming, partially offset by lower sales of ABC Studios&#146; productions driven by no new seasons of Lost and Ghost Whisperer . \n\n&#160; \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include programming and production costs which increased $211 million from $8,549 million to $8,760 million. At Cable Networks, an increase in programming and production spending of $419 million was driven by higher sports rights costs due to the addition of college football programming including more Bowl Championship Series games some of which shifted from ABC, increased contractual costs for college and professional sports programming and more episodes of original programming at the Disney Channels, partially offset by the absence of programming costs for the FIFA World Cup which was broadcast in fiscal 2010. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $208 million reflecting lower news and daytime production costs due to cost savings initiatives, a lower cost mix of programming in primetime due to a shift of hours from original scripted programming to reality programming, a shift of college sports programming to ESPN and lower production cost amortization due to a decrease in sales of ABC Studios&#146; productions. Operating expenses also increased by 2% due to a change in the transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and increased by 1% resulting from headcount growth and labor cost inflation at ESPN. \n\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing and sales costs, which included an increase due to the change in transfer pricing arrangement for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product and higher marketing costs at ESPN. \n\nEquity in the Income of Investees \n\nIncome from equity investees increased to $584 million in fiscal 2011 from $438 million in fiscal 2010 driven by an increase at AETN primarily due to a $58 million charge for our share of programming write-offs in fiscal 2010 and higher advertising and affiliate revenues in the current year, partially offset by higher marketing costs. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 20%, or $1.0 billion, to $6.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to increases at ESPN, ABC, the worldwide Disney Channels, AETN and the owned television stations. \n\nThe following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 12,877 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 11,475 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,837 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,687 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 18,714 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 17,162 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Segment operating income \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 5,233 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 4,473 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 913 &#160; &#160; &#160; 659 &#160; &#160; &#160; 39 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 6,146 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 5,132 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Parks and Resorts \n\nOperating results for the Parks and Resorts segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 9,302 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 8,404 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; International \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,495 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,357 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 11,797 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,761 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (7,383) &#160; &#160; &#160; (6,787) &#160; &#160; &#160; (9) % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,696) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,517) &#160; &#160; &#160; (12) % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,165) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,139) &#160; &#160; &#160; (2) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,553 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 1,318 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nRevenues \n\nParks and Resorts revenues increased 10%, or $1.0 billion, to $11.8 billion due to an increase of $898 million at our domestic operations and an increase of $138 million at our international operations. \n\nRevenue growth of 11% at our domestic operations reflected a 6% increase driven by higher average guest spending and a 3% increase due to volume driven by higher passenger cruise days as a result of the launch of the Disney Dream , in January 2011, and higher attendance. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices, daily hotel room rates, and food, beverage, and merchandise spending. \n\nRevenue growth of 6% at our international operations reflected a 4% increase due to higher average guest spending, a 3% increase driven by volume due to higher attendance and hotel occupancy, and a 3% favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease due to the sale of a real estate property at Disneyland Paris in fiscal 2010 and a 1% decrease due to the temporary closure of the Tokyo Disney Resort following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. \n\nThe following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Domestic &#160; &#160; International (2) &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2011 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2010 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2011 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2010 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2011 &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year 2010 &#160; Parks \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Increase/ (decrease) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Attendance \n\n&#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; (1) % &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; (1) % &#160; Per Capita Guest Spending \n\n&#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % &#160; Hotels (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Occupancy \n\n&#160; &#160; 82 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 82 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 88 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 85 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 83 % &#160; &#160; &#160; 82 % &#160; Available Room Nights (in thousands) \n\n&#160; &#160; 9,625 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,629 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,466 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,466 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,091 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,095 &#160; Per Room Guest Spending \n\n&#160; $ 241 &#160; &#160; $ 224 &#160; &#160; $ 288 &#160; &#160; $ 273 &#160; &#160; $ 251 &#160; &#160; $ 234 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels.

The euro to U.S. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.39 and $1.36 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END Costs and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses include operating labor which increased by $262 million from $3,278 million to $3,540 million driven by labor cost inflation and higher pension and postretirement medical expenses. Operating expenses also include cost of sales which increased $88 million from $1,110 million to $1,198 million driven by volume, partially offset by the absence of the costs related to a real estate sale at Disneyland Paris in fiscal 2010. Operating expenses also increased due to launch and operating costs in connection with the Disney Dream , enhancement and expansion costs, including new guest offerings at Disney California Adventure and investments in systems infrastructure, and costs for Aulani, which opened in August 2011. In addition, there was an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs and expenses was driven by higher marketing costs at our domestic parks and resorts, costs associated with the addition of the Disney Dream and Aulani, our new resort in Hawaii, and labor cost inflation. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 18%, or $235 million, to $1.6 billion due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by costs for Aulani and a decrease at Tokyo Disney Resort. \n\n&#160; \n\nStudio Entertainment \n\nOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended (1) &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Theatrical distribution \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,733 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 2,050 &#160; &#160; &#160; (15) % &#160; Home entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,435 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,666 &#160; &#160; &#160; (9) % &#160; Television distribution and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,183 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,985 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,351 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,701 &#160; &#160; &#160; (5) % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (3,253) &#160; &#160; &#160; (3,548) &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,348) &#160; &#160; &#160; (2,371) &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (132) &#160; &#160; &#160; (89) &#160; &#160; &#160; (48) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 618 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 693 &#160; &#160; &#160; (11) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Certain reclassifications have been made to the numbers presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation \n\n##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe decrease in theatrical distribution revenue reflected the success of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in fiscal 2010 compared to the performance of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Cars 2, Thor and Captain America in fiscal 2011. \n\nLower home entertainment revenue reflected an 11% decrease due to the change in the transfer pricing arrangement for Studio distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product, partially offset by a 1% increase due to higher net effective pricing internationally which benefitted from a higher Blu-ray sales mix. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. \n\nThe increase in television distribution and other revenues reflected 5% growth due to the inclusion of Marvel which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a 4% increase due to higher revenue share from the Consumer Products segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise. \n\nCost and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included a decrease of $257 million in film cost amortization, from $2,142 million to $1,885 million, driven by lower film cost write-downs. Operating expenses also include cost of sales and distribution expenses which decreased $38 million from $1,406 million to $1,368 million driven by the change in the transfer pricing arrangement between Studio Entertainment and Media Networks for distribution of Media Networks home entertainment product. \n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs were essentially flat as higher marketing for Marvel titles and an increase in technology infrastructure spending were largely offset by lower theatrical pre-release marketing expense and the change in the transfer pricing arrangement with Media Networks for home entertainment product. \n\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by higher amortization of intangible assets related to certain Marvel film properties. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income decreased 11%, or $75 million, to $618 million primarily due to lower results at our theatrical and home entertainment businesses and higher technology infrastructure spending, partially offset by lower film cost write-downs and a higher revenue share with the Consumer Products segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer Products \n\nOperating results for the Consumer Products segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; % Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Licensing and publishing \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,933 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 1,725 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; Retail and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 953 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,049 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,678 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,334) &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,236) &#160; &#160; &#160; (8) % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (794) &#160; &#160; &#160; (687) &#160; &#160; &#160; (16) % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (105) &#160; &#160; &#160; (78) &#160; &#160; &#160; (35) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Income \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 816 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 677 &#160; &#160; &#160; 21 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nThe increase in licensing and publishing revenue reflected a 6% increase driven by the strong performance of Cars, Tangled and Toy Story merchandise and a 8% increase due to higher revenue from Marvel properties. Higher revenues from Marvel properties reflected the impact of acquisition accounting which reduced revenue recognition in fiscal 2010 as well as a full year of operations as Marvel was acquired at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by a 5% decrease due to a higher revenue share to the Studio Entertainment segment resulting from the strength of Cars merchandise. \n\nThe increase in retail and other revenues was primarily due to a 9% increase from higher revenues at the Disney Store in North America and Europe driven by higher comparable store sales and a 6% increase resulting from the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan, which was acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. \n\nLicensing and publishing and retail and other revenues also increased by 2% and 3%, respectively, due to the benefit from a favorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the euro. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expenses included an increase of $57 million in cost of goods sold, from $521 million to $578 million, driven by the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. Operating expenses also included a 2% increase due to higher occupancy costs driven by an increase at our retail business reflecting the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan and a 1% increase due to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the euro. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the inclusion of a full year of operations for Marvel and various promotional initiatives across multiple businesses. \n\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets for Marvel and an increase at the Disney Stores due to new stores and remodels. \n\nSegment Operating Income \n\nSegment operating income increased 21%, or $139 million, to $816 million primarily due to increases in our Merchandise Licensing and North American retail businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nInteractive \n\nOperating results for the Interactive segment are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended (1) &#160; &#160; &#160;% Change Better / (Worse) &#160; (in millions) &#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 2, 2010 &#160; &#160; Revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Game sales and subscriptions \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 768 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 563 &#160; &#160; &#160; 36 % &#160; Advertising and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 214 &#160; &#160; &#160; 198 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 982 &#160; &#160; &#160; 761 &#160; &#160; &#160; 29 % &#160; Operating expenses \n\n&#160; &#160; (675) &#160; &#160; &#160; (554) &#160; &#160; &#160; (22) % &#160; Selling, general, administrative and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (561) &#160; &#160; &#160; (398) &#160; &#160; &#160; (41) % &#160; Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; &#160; (54) &#160; &#160; &#160; (43) &#160; &#160; &#160; (26) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Operating Loss \n\n&#160; &#160;$ (308) &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (234) &#160; &#160; &#160; (32) % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Certain reclassifications have been made to the numbers presented for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to conform to the fiscal 2012 presentation \n\n##TABLE_END Revenues \n\nGame sales and subscriptions revenue growth reflected a 12% increase due to higher console game unit sales and a 10% increase due to higher net effective pricing of console games, reflecting the strong performance of Epic Mickey and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and a shift in sales from catalog titles to new releases. Additionally, the inclusion of Playdom for a full year compared to one month in fiscal 2010 resulted in a 10% increase in game sales and subscription revenues. \n\nHigher advertising and other revenue was driven by our mobile phone service in Japan. \n\nCosts and Expenses \n\nOperating expense included a $44 million increase in product development expense from $308 million to $352 million primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year. Operating expenses also included a 14% increase due to higher cost of sales driven by fees paid to the developer of Lego Pirates of the Caribbean and higher console game unit sales. \n\nThe increase in selling, general, administrative and other costs was primarily due to the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting. \n\nSegment Operating Loss \n\nSegment operating loss was $308 million compared to $234 million in fiscal 2010 as an improvement at our console game business was more than offset by the inclusion of Playdom for a full year, including the impact of acquisition accounting. \n\nNON-SEGMENT ITEMS &#150; 2011 vs. 2010 \n\nCorporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses \n\nCorporate and unallocated shared expenses increased 9%, from $420 million to $459 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses and compensation related costs. \n\nNet Interest Expense \n\nNet interest expense is detailed below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; % Change Better/(Worse) &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160;$ &#160;(435) &#160; &#160; &#160;$ &#160;(456) &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; Interest and investment income \n\n&#160; &#160; 92 &#160; &#160; &#160; 47 &#160; &#160; &#160; 96 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; Net interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160;$ (343) &#160; &#160; &#160;$ (409) &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2011 reflected lower effective interest rates. \n\nThe increase in interest and investment income for fiscal 2011 was driven by gains on sales of investments. \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; &#160; Change Better/(Worse) &#160; Effective income tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 34.6% &#160; &#160; &#160; 34.9% &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.3 ppt &#160; ##TABLE_END The effective tax rate decreased 0.3 percentage points for the year as a prior year charge related to health care reform legislation and a current year benefit from an increase in the domestic production deduction rate were largely offset by a decrease in favorable resolutions of prior-year tax matters. During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $72 million charge related to the enactment of health care reform legislation in March 2010. Under this legislation the Company&#146;s deductions for retiree prescription drug benefits will generally be reduced by the amount of Medicare Part D drug subsidies received beginning in fiscal year 2014. Under applicable accounting rules, the Company was required to reduce its existing deferred tax asset, which was established for the future deductibility of retiree prescription drug benefit costs, to reflect the lost deductions. The reduction was recorded as a charge to earnings in the period the legislation was enacted. \n\nNoncontrolling Interests \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $101 million to $451 million due to improved operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Cash provided by operations \n\n&#160; $ 7,966 &#160; &#160; $ 6,994 &#160; &#160; $ 6,578 &#160; Cash used by investing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; (4,759) &#160; &#160; &#160; (3,286) &#160; &#160; &#160; (4,523) &#160; Cash used by financing activities \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;(2,985) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(3,233) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(2,663) &#160; Impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; &#160; (20) &#160; &#160; &#160; (12) &#160; &#160; &#160; (87) &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160; $ 202 &#160; &#160; $ 463 &#160; &#160; $ (695) &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Operating Activities \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2012 increased 14% or $1.0 billion to $8.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher net operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Parks and Resorts, Media Networks and Consumer Products businesses and lower operating cash payments at Studio Entertainment driven by lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs. These cash flow increases were partially offset by higher operating cash payments at Parks and Resorts, lower revenues at Studio Entertainment and higher interest and income tax payments. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation and costs for resort expansion and new guest offerings. The increase in interest payments was primarily due to the payment of previously accrued interest on Disneyland Paris borrowings. \n\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2011 increased 6% or $416 million to $7.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenues at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer Products and Interactive businesses, partially offset by lower revenues at our Studio Entertainment business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments at Corporate and at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Interactive, and Consumer Products businesses, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments at our Studio Entertainment business. The increase in cash payments at Corporate was driven by higher contributions to our pension plans, while the increase at Media Networks was primarily due to higher investment in television programming and production. The increase in cash payments at Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation, higher promotional and operating costs from the January 2011 launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , and higher marketing and sales expenses and expansion costs for Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort. The increase in cash payments at Interactive reflects the inclusion of Playdom, while the increase in cash payments at Consumer Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of The Disney Store Japan and Marvel. The decrease in cash payments at Studio Entertainment was driven by lower film production spending. \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation expense is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Media Networks \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Cable Networks \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 141 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 134 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 118 &#160; Broadcasting \n\n&#160; &#160; 100 &#160; &#160; &#160; 95 &#160; &#160; &#160; 95 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total Media Networks \n\n&#160; &#160; 241 &#160; &#160; &#160; 229 &#160; &#160; &#160; 213 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Parks and Resorts \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Domestic \n\n&#160; &#160; 927 &#160; &#160; &#160; 842 &#160; &#160; &#160; 807 &#160; International \n\n&#160; &#160; 314 &#160; &#160; &#160; 323 &#160; &#160; &#160; 332 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total Parks and Resorts \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,241 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,165 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,139 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Studio Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 48 &#160; &#160; &#160; 53 &#160; &#160; &#160; 56 &#160; Consumer Products \n\n&#160; &#160; 55 &#160; &#160; &#160; 48 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; Interactive \n\n&#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 182 &#160; &#160; &#160; 148 &#160; &#160; &#160; 142 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total depreciation expense \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,784 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 1,659 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 1,602 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Amortization of intangible assets is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; 2010 &#160; Media Networks \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 17 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 8 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 9 &#160; Parks and Resorts \n\n&#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; Studio Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 94 &#160; &#160; &#160; 79 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33 &#160; Consumer Products \n\n&#160; &#160; 60 &#160; &#160; &#160; 57 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45 &#160; Interactive \n\n&#160; &#160; 32 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total amortization of intangible assets \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 203 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 182 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 111 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce television and feature film programming.

Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company&#146;s broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities.

The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by resort expansion and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and construction costs at Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by reduced expenditures at Disneyland Resort. The increase in capital expenditures at domestic and international parks and resorts in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 reflected the final payment on our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream , theme park and resort expansions and new guest offerings at Walt Disney World Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the development of Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities. \n\nCapital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. The increases in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were driven by investments in corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nDuring fiscal 2012, acquisitions totaled $1.0 billion primarily due to the acquisition of an incremental 43% interest in UTV and a 49% interest in Seven TV network in Russia. We also made a $300 million equity contribution to AETN. \n\nDuring fiscal 2011, we received proceeds from dispositions of $564 million primarily from the sale of Miramax and invested $184 million for acquisitions which included additional payments related to the acquisition of Playdom, Inc. (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nDuring fiscal 2010, cash used for acquisitions totaled $2.5 billion and included the acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Playdom, Inc., and we received net proceeds totaling $170 million from the sale of our investments in two television services in Europe and the sale of the rights and assets related to the Power Rangers property. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash used by financing activities in fiscal 2012 was $3.0 billion compared to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2011. The net use of cash in the current year was driven by repurchases of common stock and dividend payments totaling $4.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $1.0 billion and net borrowings of $0.4 billion. The decrease in cash used by financing activities of $0.2 billion compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease of $1.7 billion in repurchases of common stock and dividend payments, partially offset by $1.2 billion less net borrowings and $0.1 billion lower proceeds from stock options. \n\nCash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2010. The net use of cash in fiscal 2011 was driven by repurchases of common stock and dividend payments totaling $5.7 billion, partially offset by net borrowings of $1.6 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $1.1 billion. The increase in cash used by financing activities of $0.6 billion compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase of $2.4 billion in repurchases of common stock and dividend payments, partially offset by $1.8 billion more net borrowings. \n\nDuring the year ended September 29, 2012, the Company&#146;s borrowing activity was as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;(in millions) \n\n&#160; October 1, 2011 &#160; &#160; Additions &#160; &#160; Payments &#160; &#160; Other Activity &#160; &#160; September 29, 2012 &#160; Commercial paper borrowings \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 1,583 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 467 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160;$ &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 2,050 &#160; U.S. medium-term notes \n\n&#160; &#160; 8,400 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,977 &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,268) &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,117 &#160; European medium-term notes and other foreign currency denominated borrowings (1) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,111 &#160; &#160; &#160; 800 &#160; &#160; &#160; (842) &#160; &#160; &#160; 246 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,315 &#160; Other \n\n&#160; &#160; 572 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; (82) &#160; &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; &#160; 562 &#160; Disneyland Paris borrowings (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,981 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; (1,897) &#160; &#160; &#160; (84) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; Hong Kong Disneyland borrowings (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 330 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; (63) &#160; &#160; &#160; 267 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 13,977 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 4,246 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ &#160;(4,089) &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 177 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 14,311 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; The other activity is primarily borrowings assumed in the acquisition of UTV. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) &#160; The other activity is primarily the impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) &#160; The other activity is primarily due to the conversion of a portion of the HKSAR&#146;s loan to equity pursuant to the capital realignment and expansion plan (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s bank facilities are as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; Committed Capacity &#160; &#160; Capacity Used &#160; &#160; Unused Capacity &#160; Bank facilities expiring February 2015 \n\n&#160; $ 2,250 &#160; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; &#160; $ 2,250 &#160; Bank facilities expiring February 2017 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,250 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,250 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 4,500 &#160; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; &#160; $ 4,500 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END In June 2012, the Company entered into a new five-year $2.25 billion bank facility with a syndicate of lenders which expires 2017. This facility replaced an existing three-year $2.25 billion facility which was scheduled to expire in 2013, and in combination with the existing $2.25 billion facility that matures in 2015, is used to support commercial paper borrowings. These bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the Company&#146;s public debt rating and can range from 0.26% to 1.93%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in February 2015, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of September 29, 2012, $258 million of letters of credit had been issued of which none were issued under this facility. \n\nThe Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. \n\nThe Company paid a $0.60 per share dividend ($1.1 billion) during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to fiscal 2011. The Company paid a $0.40 per share dividend ($756 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 2010, and paid a $0.35 per share dividend ($653 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to fiscal 2009. As of the filing date of this report, the Board of Directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2012. \n\nDuring fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 72 million shares of Disney common stock for $3.0 billion. During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 135 million shares of Disney common stock for $5.0 billion. During fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 80 million shares of Disney common stock for $2.7 billion. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 232 million additional shares. \n\nWe believe that the Company&#146;s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company&#146;s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. See &#147;Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors&#148;. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company&#146;s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company&#146;s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of September 29, 2012, Moody&#146;s Investors Service&#146;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook; Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and Fitch&#146;s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F-1, respectively, with stable outlook. The Company&#146;s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 29, 2012, by a significant margin. The Company&#146;s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default. \n\nIn September 2012, the Company provided &#128;1.3 billion of financing to ED which ED used to repay its outstanding third-party bank debt. The repayment eliminated certain financial and operating covenants, notably those related to capital expenditure limitations and the payment of royalties and management fees due to the Company. There was no net increase in consolidated borrowings for the Company as a result of the refinancing. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nThe Company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 29, 2012 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Payments Due by Period &#160; (in millions) \n\n&#160; Total &#160; &#160; Less than 1 Year &#160; &#160; 1-3 Years &#160; &#160; 4-5 Years &#160; &#160; More than 5 Years &#160; Borrowings (Note 8) (1) \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 18,586 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 4,025 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 3,376 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 3,787 &#160; &#160; $ 7,398 &#160; Operating lease commitments (Note 14) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,323 &#160; &#160; &#160; 471 &#160; &#160; &#160; 673 &#160; &#160; &#160; 388 &#160; &#160; &#160; 791 &#160; Capital lease obligations (Note 14) \n\n&#160; &#160; 760 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61 &#160; &#160; &#160; 114 &#160; &#160; &#160; 56 &#160; &#160; &#160; 529 &#160; Sports programming commitments (Note 14) \n\n&#160; &#160; 40,664 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,708 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8,805 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,618 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20,533 &#160; Broadcast programming commitments (Note 14) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,116 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,090 &#160; &#160; &#160; 544 &#160; &#160; &#160; 402 &#160; &#160; &#160; 80 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total sports and other broadcast programming commitments \n\n&#160; &#160; 42,780 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,798 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,349 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8,020 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20,613 &#160; Other (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,615 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,168 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,129 &#160; &#160; &#160; 351 &#160; &#160; &#160; 967 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total contractual obligations (3) \n\n&#160; &#160;$ 69,064 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 11,523 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 14,641 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 12,602 &#160; &#160; &#160;$ 30,298 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; Amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $296 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nContingent Commitments and Contractual Guarantees \n\nThe Company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. The Company does not currently expect that these arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the Company. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company&#146;s contingent commitments and contractual guarantees. \n\nLegal and Tax Matters \n\nAs disclosed in Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters. \n\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFilm and Television Revenues and Costs \n\nWe expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period&#146;s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimates of Ultimate Revenues increase, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. \n\n&#160; \n\nWith respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly correlated with domestic theatrical performance. Domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film&#146;s release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the Company&#146;s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home video products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. \n\nWith respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is the program&#146;s rating and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company&#146;s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. \n\nWe expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired movies, series and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program&#146;s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated values of each year are based on our projection of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season&#146;s relative value, we expense the related contractual payment during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. \n\nCosts of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company&#146;s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news, and sports (includes network and cable). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. Individual programs are written-off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies. \n\nWe reduce home entertainment and software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated. \n\nWe recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a five-year time period based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns. If actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. In addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions \n\nThe Company&#146;s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. \n\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We decreased our discount rate to 3.85% at the end of fiscal 2012 from 4.75% at the end of fiscal 2011 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our September 29, 2012 measurement date. This decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense (benefit expense) in fiscal 2013. The assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company&#146;s discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2013 by $265 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 29, 2012 by $2.3 billion, respectively. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $226 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. \n\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.75% for both of the 2012 and 2011 actuarial valuations. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2013 annual benefit expense by approximately $82 million. \n\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans. \n\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments \n\nThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill. \n\nTo determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third-party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. \n\nIn times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company&#146;s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. \n\nThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over \n\n&#160; \n\nthe useful life of an asset group against the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group&#146;s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group&#146;s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset&#146;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. \n\nThe Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. \n\nDuring fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment, and the impairment charges recorded were not material. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nWe evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, cost and expenses may decrease in future periods. \n\nContingencies and Litigation \n\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. \n\nIncome Tax Audits \n\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company&#146;s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company&#146;s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are &#147;forward-looking,&#148; including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management&#146;s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K. \n\n&#160; \n\n"}
