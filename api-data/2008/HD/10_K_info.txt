Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nExecutive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data \n\n&#160;\n\nFor fiscal year ended February 1, 2009 (&#147;fiscal 2008&#148;), we reported Net Earnings of $2.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $1.34 compared to Net Earnings of $4.4 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.37 for fiscal year ended February 3, 2008 (&#147;fiscal 2007&#148;). \n\n&#160;\n\nWe took action on several strategic items in fiscal 2008 resulting in total pretax charges of $951 million (&#147;Rationalization Charges&#148;). These Rationalization Charges included the closing of 15 underperforming stores and the removal of approximately 50 stores from our new store opening pipeline, the planned exit of our EXPO, THD Design Center, Yardbirds and HD Bath businesses and strategic support staff reductions. Additionally, fiscal 2008 included a $163 million pretax write-down of our investment in HD Supply and a $52 million loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the settlement of working capital from the sale of HD Supply. \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks for fiscal 2007. The 53 rd week added approximately $1.1 billion in Net Sales and increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe reported Earnings from Continuing Operations of $2.3 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $1.37 for fiscal 2008 compared to Earnings from Continuing Operations of $4.2 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations of $2.27 for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply, Earnings from Continuing Operations were $3.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.78 for fiscal 2008. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Sales decreased 7.8% to $71.3 billion for fiscal 2008 from $77.3 billion for fiscal 2007. Excluding the 53 rd week of fiscal 2007, Net Sales decreased 6.5% for fiscal 2008. The slowdown in the global economy and weakness in the U.S. residential construction and home improvement markets negatively impacted our Net Sales for fiscal 2008. Our comparable store sales declined 8.7% in fiscal 2008 driven by a 5.5% decline in comparable store customer transactions, as well as a 3.3% decline in our average ticket. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn fiscal 2008, despite the continuing difficult economic environment, we continued to focus on our core retail business, investing in our associates and stores and improving our customer service. We have exited non-core businesses, restructured support staff and have stopped applying significant capital to building new square footage. We remain committed to the long-term health of our business through our strategy of investing in our retail business through the following five priorities: \n\n&#160;\n\nAssociate Engagement &#150; We have taken a number of actions to improve associate engagement by changing the way our associates are compensated, recognized and rewarded, including enhancing our success sharing program, an incentive program for our hourly associates driven by individual store performance. Success sharing payouts will be received by 83% of our stores for the second half of fiscal 2008 compared to 44% of stores for the same period last year. \n\n&#160;\n\nProduct Excitement &#150; We continue to work on our merchandising transformation by redefining how we run our business, implementing a focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment and creating new tools to support better merchandising decision making. As a result, we saw consumer unit share gains against the market in several key merchandising classes. For example, carpet, hand tools, power tools, blinds, bath fixtures, windows and doors all gained share in fiscal 2008. Our new lower price campaign is a major component of our portfolio strategy. An example is interior paint, where we have lowered prices on items such as Behr Flat Premium Plus. Unit sales are increasing, and at the same time, our attachment sales of related items are going up. \n\n&#160;\n\nShopping Environment &#150; We continued our store reinvestment by completing an aggressive list of maintenance projects, including the completion of our lighting upgrade, as well as more complex repair and maintenance activities for hundreds of other stores. In addition to programmatic maintenance, our integrated field and support center teams have rolled out store standards to all stores. We developed and piloted common guidelines on store appearance and shopability, including standards for front apron merchandising, wingstack usage, signage presentation, fixturing and off-shelf product. This \n\ninitiative helps reduce the amount of time our store managers spend on these issues, removes unnecessary clutter from the aisles and implements a basic and consistent approach to store appearance. \n\n&#160;\n\nProduct Availability &#150; We continued our supply chain transformation to improve product availability. We have five RDCs operating that now serve approximately 500 of our stores. We plan to open additional RDCs in fiscal 2009 and expect that they will serve approximately 1,000 of our stores by the end of fiscal 2009. We remain committed to our overall roll-out strategy for RDCs, supporting our goal of increasing our central distribution penetration. \n\n&#160;\n\nOwn the Pro &#150; We have made significant improvements in the services we provide our pro customers, particularly through our pro bid room. The pro bid room, which is available in all of our stores, allows us to leverage the buying power of The Home Depot for the benefit of our pro customers. Our direct ship program allows us to have large orders delivered from our vendors to the customer&#146;s job site directly, reducing handling, lead-time and cost while building loyalty with the pro customer. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe opened 62 new stores in fiscal 2008, including 6 relocations, closed 15 stores as part of our store rationalization actions and closed one store in Mexico due to a fire, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2008 to 2,274. As of the end of fiscal 2008, 262, or approximately 12%, of our stores were located in Canada, Mexico and China compared to 243 as of fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe generated $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008. We used this cash flow to repay $2.0 billion of short-term debt and other debt obligations, fund $1.8 billion in capital expenditures and pay $1.5 billion of dividends. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2008, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 54.4% compared to 64.3% at the end of fiscal 2007. Our return on invested capital for continuing operations (computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing twelve months) was 9.5% at the end of fiscal 2008 compared to 13.9% for fiscal 2007. This decrease reflects the decline in our operating profit, which includes the impact of the Rationalization Charges. Excluding Rationalization Charges, our return on invested capital for continuing operations was 11.4%. \n\nWe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. We believe the information presented in our Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an understanding of our business, our operations and our financial condition. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % Increase (Decrease) % of Net Sales In Dollar Amounts Fiscal Year (1) 2008 2007 2008 2007 2006 vs. 2007 vs. 2006 &#160; NET SALES \n\n100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (7.8 )% (2.1 )% Gross Profit \n\n33.7 33.6 33.6 (7.7 ) (2.1 ) Operating Expenses: \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\n25.0 22.1 20.4 4.7 5.9 Depreciation and Amortization \n\n2.5 2.2 2.0 4.9 8.1 Total Operating Expenses \n\n27.5 24.3 22.4 4.7 6.1 OPERATING INCOME \n\n6.1 9.4 11.2 (39.8 ) (18.3 ) Interest and Other (Income) Expense: \n\nInterest and Investment Income \n\n&#151; (0.1 ) &#151; (75.7 ) 174.1 Interest Expense \n\n0.9 0.9 0.5 (10.3 ) 78.0 Other \n\n0.2 &#151; &#151; 0.0 0.0 Interest and Other, net \n\n1.1 0.8 0.5 23.6 70.9 EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES \n\n5.0 8.6 10.8 (45.8 ) (22.1 ) Provision for Income Taxes \n\n1.8 3.1 4.1 (47.0 ) (25.5 ) EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS \n\n3.2 % 5.4 % 6.7 % (45.1 )% (20.1 )% SELECTED SALES DATA \n\nNumber of Customer Transactions (in millions) (2) \n\n1,272 1,336 1,330 (4.8 )% 0.5 % Average Ticket (2) \n\n$ 55.61 $ 57.48 $ 58.90 (3.3 ) (2.4 ) Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (in thousands) (2) \n\n$ 601 $ 658 $ 723 (8.7 ) (9.0 ) Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot (2) \n\n$ 298.19 $ 331.86 $ 357.83 (10.1 ) (7.3 ) Comparable Store Sales Decrease (%) (3) \n\n(8.7 )% (6.7 )% (2.8 )% N/A N/A Note: Certain percentages may not sum to totals due to rounding. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 refer to the fiscal years ended February 1, 2009, February 3, 2008 and January 28, 2007, respectively. Fiscal years 2008 and 2006 include 52 weeks; fiscal year 2007 includes 53 weeks. &#160; (2) The 53 rd week of fiscal 2007 increased customer transactions by 20 million, negatively impacted average ticket by $0.05, negatively impacted weighted average weekly sales per operating store by $3 thousand and increased weighted average sales per square foot by $4.77. &#160; (3) Includes Net Sales at locations open greater than 12 months, including relocated and remodeled stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 365 th day of operation. Comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for Net Sales or Net Earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nResults of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. \n\nFiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Sales \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2008 consisted of 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2007. Net Sales for fiscal 2008 decreased 7.8% to $71.3 billion from $77.3 billion for fiscal 2007. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales and $1.1 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007, partially offset by Net Sales of $1.8 billion from new stores in fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales decreased 8.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to a decrease of 6.7% for fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nThere were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The U.S. residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft and consumers were challenged due to higher unemployment and an across-the-board tightening of consumer credit availability. We saw relative strength in Building Materials, Plumbing, Garden/Seasonal and Hardware as comparable store sales in these areas were above or at the Company average for fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales for Lumber, Flooring, Paint, Electrical, Kitchen/Bath and Millwork were below the Company average for fiscal 2008. Softness in our big ticket categories negatively impacted average ticket, which decreased 3.3% to $55.61 for fiscal 2008. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn order to meet our customer service objectives, we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores (&#147;cannibalize&#148;) to enhance service levels, gain incremental sales and increase market penetration. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 5% of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2008, which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1%. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. Due to the highly-fragmented U.S. home improvement industry, in which we estimate our market share is approximately 20%, measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult. \n\n&#160;\n\nGross Profit \n\n&#160;\n\nGross Profit decreased 7.7% to $24.0 billion for fiscal 2008 from $26.0 billion for fiscal 2007. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to 33.6% for fiscal 2007, an increase of four basis points. This gross margin expansion included $30 million in markdowns taken in connection with our Rationalization Charges. Excluding these markdowns, our Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales increased eight basis points for fiscal 2008, reflecting our focused bay portfolio approach to product assortment. \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160;\n\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses (&#147;SG&#038;A&#148;) increased 4.7% to $17.8 billion for fiscal 2008 from $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#038;A was 25.0% for fiscal 2008 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, SG&#038;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2008 was 23.7%, an increase of approximately 170 basis points over the prior year. The increase in SG&#038;A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of expense deleverage in the negative comparable store sales environment, as well as an increase of approximately 70 basis points due to a higher cost of credit associated with the private label credit card program. For fiscal 2008, the penetration of the private label credit card sales was 28.1% compared to 29.4% for fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nDepreciation and Amortization increased 4.9% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2007. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.5% for fiscal 2008 and 2.2% for fiscal 2007. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to sales deleverage and the depreciation of our investments in shorter lived assets such as store resets and technology. \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Income \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Income decreased 39.8% to $4.4 billion for fiscal 2008 from $7.2 billion for fiscal 2007. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 6.1% for fiscal 2008 compared to 9.4% for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges, Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 7.4% for fiscal 2008. \n\nInterest and Other, net \n\n&#160;\n\nIn fiscal 2008, we recognized $769 million of Interest and Other, net, compared to $622 million in fiscal 2007. Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 1.1% for fiscal 2008 compared to 0.8% for fiscal 2007. Interest and Other, net, reflects a $163 million charge to write-down our investment in HD Supply. Excluding this charge, Interest and Other, net, as a percent of Net Sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2008. \n\n&#160;\n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nOur combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 35.6% for fiscal 2008 from 36.4% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects lower state and foreign effective tax rates. \n\n&#160;\n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $1.37 for fiscal 2008 and $2.27 for fiscal 2007. Excluding the Rationalization Charges and the write-down of our investment in HD Supply, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations for fiscal 2008 were $1.78, a decrease of 21.6% from fiscal 2007. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were favorably impacted by the repurchase of shares of our common stock. We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $70 million in fiscal 2008 and 293 million shares for $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 746 million shares of our common stock for a total of $27.3 billion. \n\n&#160;\n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nOn August 30, 2007, the Company closed the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2008 consist of a loss of $52 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, recorded to settle net working capital matters arising from the sale of HD Supply. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 consist of the results of operations for HD Supply through August 30, 2007 and a $4 million loss on the sale of HD Supply. Net Sales from discontinued operations were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2007 and Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were $185 million for fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nNon-GAAP Measurements \n\n&#160;\n\nTo provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance for fiscal 2008, we supplemented our reporting with non-GAAP measurements to reflect the Rationalization Charges as described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the charge to write-down our investment in HD Supply as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measurements. We believe these non-GAAP measurements provide management and investors with meaningful information to understand and analyze our performance. The following reconciles the non-GAAP measurements reflecting the Rationalization Charges and investment write-down to the reported GAAP information for fiscal 2008: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As Non-GAAP % of amounts in millions, except per share data Reported Charges Measurement Net Sales Net Sales \n\n$ 71,288 $ &#151; $ 71,288 100.0 % Cost of Sales \n\n47,298 30 47,268 66.3 Gross Profit \n\n23,990 (30 ) 24,020 33.7 Operating Expenses \n\n19,631 921 18,710 26.2 Operating Income \n\n4,359 (951 ) 5,310 7.4 Interest and Other, net \n\n769 163 606 0.9 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes \n\n3,590 (1,114 ) 4,704 6.6 Provision for Income Taxes \n\n1,278 (430 ) 1,708 2.4 Earnings from Continuing Operations \n\n$ 2,312 $ (684 ) $ 2,996 4.2 % Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\n$ 1.37 $ (0.41 ) $ 1.78 N/A ##TABLE_END \n\nFiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2007 (&#147;fiscal 2006&#148;) \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Sales \n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2007 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2006. Net Sales for fiscal 2007 decreased 2.1%, or $1.7 billion, to $77.3 billion from $79.0 billion for fiscal 2006. The decrease in Net Sales for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales, partially offset by Net Sales of $3.7 billion for fiscal 2007 from new stores and $1.1 billion of Net Sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2007. Comparable store sales decreased 6.7% for fiscal 2007 compared to a decrease of 2.8% for fiscal 2006. \n\n&#160;\n\nThere were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline. The residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft, especially in some of our traditionally strong markets such as Florida, California and the Northeast. The combination of softness in our big ticket categories and commodity price deflation negatively impacted average ticket, which decreased 2.4% to $57.48 for fiscal 2007. Our international business performed well in fiscal 2007. Our Mexican stores posted a double digit comparable store sales increase for fiscal 2007, and Canada&#146;s comparable store sales were also positive. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 10% of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal 2007, which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 1%. \n\n&#160;\n\nGross Profit \n\n&#160;\n\nGross Profit decreased 2.1% to $26.0 billion for fiscal 2007 from $26.5 billion for fiscal 2006. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.6% for fiscal 2007, flat compared to fiscal 2006. Lower deferred interest costs associated with our private label credit card financing programs provided a benefit of 39 basis points to Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2007. The deferred interest benefit was mostly offset by a higher penetration of lower margin products such as appliances and markdowns taken to clear through some seasonal items, such as outdoor power equipment and grills, and to allow us to transition into new products, such as assembled cabinets and kitchen accessories. \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160;\n\nSG&#038;A increased 5.9% to $17.1 billion for fiscal 2007 from $16.1 billion for fiscal 2006. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&#038;A was 22.1% for fiscal 2007 compared to 20.4% for fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, our profit sharing with the third-party administrator of the private label credit card portfolio was $275 million less than what we received in fiscal 2006. We also recognized $88 million of write-offs associated with certain future store locations that we determined we will not open and $34 million of expense associated with closing our 11 Home Depot Landscape Supply stores and our Tampa Call Center in fiscal 2007. SG&#038;A also reflects investments we are making in support of our five key priorities. As a percentage of Net Sales, total payroll increased by 76 basis points for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. This reflects investments in store labor and our Master Trade Specialists program, the impact of our success sharing bonus plans, as well as the negative sales environment. The increase in SG&#038;A for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was partially offset by $129 million of executive severance recorded in fiscal 2006. \n\n&#160;\n\nDepreciation and Amortization increased 8.1% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2007 from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2006. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 2.2% for fiscal 2007 and 2.0% for fiscal 2006. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology. \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Income \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Income decreased 18.3% to $7.2 billion for fiscal 2007 from $8.9 billion for fiscal 2006. Operating Income as a percent of Net Sales was 9.4% for fiscal 2007 compared to 11.2% for fiscal 2006. \n\n&#160;\n\nInterest and Other, net \n\n&#160;\n\nIn fiscal 2007, we recognized $622 million of net Interest Expense compared to $364 million in fiscal 2006. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.8% for fiscal 2007 compared to 0.5% for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the December 2006 issuance of $750 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes, $1.25 billion of 5.25% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.875% Senior Notes. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nOur combined effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to 36.4% for fiscal 2007 from 38.1% for fiscal 2006. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of a one-time retroactive tax assessment received from the Canadian province of Quebec in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and tax benefits recognized upon settlement of several state audits and completion of the fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal tax audits in fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were $2.27 for fiscal 2007 and $2.55 for fiscal 2006. The 53 rd week increased Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations by approximately $0.04 for fiscal 2007. Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 by the repurchase of shares of our common stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nDiscontinued operations consist of the results of operations for HD Supply through August 30, 2007 and a loss on the sale of HD Supply. Net Sales from discontinued operations were $7.4 billion for fiscal 2007 compared to $11.8 billion for fiscal 2006. Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were $185 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $495 million for fiscal 2006. Earnings from Discontinued Operations for fiscal 2007 include a $4 million loss, net of tax, recognized on the sale of the business. \n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\nCash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2008, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $5.5 billion compared to $5.7 billion for fiscal 2007. This change was primarily a result of decreased Net Earnings partially offset by improved inventory management. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities for fiscal 2008 was $1.7 billion compared to $4.8 billion provided by investing activities for fiscal 2007. The change in Net Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Activities was primarily the result of $8.3 billion of net proceeds from the sale of HD Supply in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 partially offset by $1.7 billion less in capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn fiscal 2008, we spent $1.8 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 45% for new stores, 15% for merchandising and operations, 12% for maintenance, 11% for core technology and 17% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2008, we added 62 new stores, including six relocations. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2008 was $3.7 billion compared with $10.6 billion for fiscal 2007. The decrease in Net Cash Used in Financing Activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 289 million shares of our common stock for $10.7 billion in connection with our tender offer related to the sale of HD Supply in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and by repayments in fiscal 2008 of $1.7 billion of short-term commercial paper and $282 million of structured financing debt. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock for $70 million in fiscal 2008 and a total of 293 million shares for $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007, including a $10.7 billion tender offer funded primarily using proceeds from the sale of HD Supply. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2002, we have repurchased 746 million shares of our common stock for a total of $27.3 billion. As of February 1, 2009, $12.7 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization. Given current market conditions, we have suspended the repurchase program until our business and credit markets stabilize. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. In connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.25 billion. As of February 1, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2010, contains various restrictive covenants, all of which we are in compliance. None of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. \n\nWe use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt and Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2008, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 54.4% compared to 64.3% at the end of fiscal 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of February 1, 2009, we had $525 million in Cash and Short-Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements. We intend to use cash flow generated by operations to repay $1.8 billion in debt coming due in fiscal 2009. \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2008 and 2007, we entered into interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with notional amounts of $3.0 billion, that swapped fixed rate interest on our $3.0 billion 5.40% Senior Notes for variable rate interest equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 149 basis points. In fiscal 2008, we received $56 million to settle these swaps, which will be amortized to reduce Interest Expense over the remaining term of the debt. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt February 1, 2009, we had outstanding an interest rate swap, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, with a notional amount of $750 million that swaps variable rate interest on our $750 million Floating Rate Senior Notes for fixed rate interest at 4.36% that expires on December 16, 2009. At February 1, 2009, the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of $21 million, which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle this interest rate swap agreement. \n\n&#160;\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n&#160;\n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\n&#160;\n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of February 1, 2009 (amounts in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations \n\nTotal 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 Thereafter &#160; Total Debt (1) \n\n$ 17,850 $ 2,327 $ 2,943 $ 2,068 $ 10,512 Capital Lease Obligations (2) \n\n1,366 88 178 178 922 Operating Leases \n\n8,738 804 1,366 1,094 5,474 Purchase Obligations (3) \n\n6,123 1,687 1,791 1,712 933 FIN 48 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (4) \n\n18 18 &#151; &#151; &#151; Total \n\n$ 34,095 $ 4,924 $ 6,278 $ 5,052 $ 17,841 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $417 million. Includes $6.8 billion of interest payments and $2 million, net, of unamortized non-cash items. &#160; (2) Includes $949 million of imputed interest. &#160; (3) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. &#160; (4) Excludes $677 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments related to the FIN 48 liabilities. ##TABLE_END 22 \n\n&#160;\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n\n&#160;\n\nOur exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of February 1, 2009 we had, net of discounts, $11.0 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The market values of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of February 1, 2009, were approximately $10.0 billion. \n\n&#160;\n\nImpact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\n&#160;\n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. \n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n&#160;\n\nWe recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. We also record Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nMerchandise Inventories \n\n&#160;\n\nOur Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 82% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2008 or 2007. \n\n&#160;\n\nIndependent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, &#147;swell&#148;) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. \n\nSelf-Insurance \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers&#146; compensation and medical claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. \n\n&#160;\n\nVendor Allowances \n\n&#160;\n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors&#146; products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. \n\n&#160;\n\nVolume rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors&#146; products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in SG&#038;A. \n\n&#160;\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\n&#160;\n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when management makes the decision to relocate or close a store or other location, or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A store&#146;s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, a provision is made to write down the related assets to fair value if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual results differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Impairment losses are recorded as a component of SG&#038;A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a location closes, we also recognize in SG&#038;A the net present value of future lease obligations, less estimated sublease income. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn fiscal 2008, we recorded $580 million of asset impairments and $252 million of lease obligation costs as part of our Rationalization Charges. See Note 2 for more details on the Rationalization Charges. We also recorded impairments on the other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. \n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\n&#160;\n\nIn June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) Emerging Issues Task Force No. 03-6-1, &#147;Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities&#148; (&#147;FSP-EITF 03-6-1&#148;). FSP-EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. FSP-EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. FSP-EITF 03-6-1 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "}
