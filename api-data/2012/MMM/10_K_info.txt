Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M&#146;s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M&#146;s MD&#38;A is presented in eight sections: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#183; &#160; Overview \n\n&#183; &#160; Results of Operations \n\n&#183; &#160; Performance by Business Segment \n\n&#183; &#160; Performance by Geographic Area \n\n&#183; &#160; Critical Accounting Estimates \n\n&#183; &#160; New Accounting Pronouncements \n\n&#183; &#160; Financial Condition and Liquidity \n\n&#183; &#160; Financial Instruments \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. In 2012, 3M managed its operations in six operating business segments: Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Display and Graphics; and Electro and Communications. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsistent with 3M&#146;s strategy of building relevance and presence in the marketplace, the Company announced in October 2012 that it was immediately beginning to align resources and management toward a new structure comprised of five business groups: Consumer; Industrial; Health Care; Safety and Graphics; and Electronics and Energy. The company&#146;s operating results were managed on the basis of its existing segment structure through 2012, with the intention that results be managed under the new alignment once it is fully effective in the first quarter of 2013. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2012 net income attributable to 3M was $991 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, compared to $954 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth-quarter 2012 sales totaled $7.4 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011. Organic local-currency sales (which include organic volume and selling price impacts) grew 4.3 percent, acquisitions added 0.9 percent to sales, and currency effects reduced sales by 1.0 percent year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, Consumer and Office led with organic local-currency sales growth of 8.7 percent, driven by consumer health care, construction and home improvement markets, and stationery and office supplies. Display and Graphics organic local-currency sales growth was 8.3 percent, led by optical systems, with sales also increasing in architectural markets, traffic safety systems and commercial graphics. Health Care organic local-currency sales grew 5.9 percent, with sales growth in all businesses, led by food safety, health information systems, skin and wound care, and oral care. Industrial and Transportation organic local-currency sales grew 3.9 percent, led by liquid filtration, aerospace, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and automotive OEM. Both the advanced materials and renewable energy businesses declined year-on-year. Electro and Communications organic local-currency sales growth was 1.8 percent, with sales increases in electrical and telecommunication markets partially offset by a decline in consumer electronics-related businesses. Organic local-currency sales declined 1.7 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, as sales growth in infrastructure protection, personal safety and roofing granules was more than offset by a year-on-year decline in security systems. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 2012 organic local-currency sales growth was 9.7 percent in Latin America/Canada, 5.8 percent in Asia Pacific, and 5.2 percent in the United States. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) organic local-currency sales declined 1.0 percent, impacted by a weak economy in Western Europe. Latin America/Canada sales growth was broad-based, with all six of our business segments generating positive organic local-currency sales growth, led by Health Care; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Consumer and Office; and Electro and Communications. Organic local-currency sales growth increased 11 percent in Brazil, in the face of a still-recovering economy, and Mexico grew nearly 10 percent. In Asia Pacific, Japan declined year-on-year, reflecting continued challenging economic conditions. Organic local-currency sales in the rest of Asia Pacific grew nearly 10 percent, with China up over 16 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth in the United States was led by Consumer and Office. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2012, net income attributable to 3M was $4.444 billion, or $6.32 per diluted share, compared to $4.283 billion, or $5.96 per diluted share, in 2011, an increase of 6.0 percent on a per diluted share basis. Sales totaled $29.9 billion, an increase of 1.0 percent from 2011. Organic local-currency sales grew 2.6 percent, acquisitions added 0.8 percent to sales and currency effects reduced sales by 2.4 percent year-on-year. From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales growth was 4.7 percent in Health Care, 4.5 percent in Industrial and Transportation, 3.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\npercent in Consumer and Office, and 2.2 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services. Local-currency sales declined 0.8 percent in Electro and Communications and 2.4 percent in Display and Graphics. From a geographic area perspective, 2012 organic local-currency sales growth was 10.9 percent in Latin America/Canada, 4.2 percent in the United States, and 0.1 percent in Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific was impacted by a soft global consumer electronics industry. EMEA organic local-currency sales declined 0.6 percent, impacted by a weak economy in Western Europe. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2012 was 21.7 percent of sales, compared to 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, an improvement of 0.8 percentage points. The primary benefit (as discussed in the Results of Operations section) related to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. Currency effects reduced diluted earnings per share by an estimated 15 cents. Net insurance recoveries in 2012 related to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan increased earnings by approximately 4 cents per diluted share. In 2011, the impact of natural disasters, net of insurance recoveries, reduced earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share (discussed further below). Early retirement/restructuring costs for 2012 totaled approximately 8 cents per diluted share, which included the first quarter 2012 charge of approximately 3 cents per diluted share related to a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe most significant non-operating items that impacted earnings were diluted shares outstanding and income taxes. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2.2 percent to 703.3 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 14 cents. The income tax rate for 2012 was 29.0 percent compared to 27.8 percent in 2011, which decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 11 cents. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2011 sales totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of 5.7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to 3M was $954 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $928 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. 3M&#146;s sales growth was led by its industrial-oriented businesses, along with steady growth in consumer and health care. The business environment remained challenging, impacted by deteriorating demand in Western Europe and slower consumer electronics activity. While sales grew across much of the portfolio, sales of optical films for LCD TVs remained weak and momentum also slowed in other parts of electronics. Four of the Company&#146;s six business segments showed growth in sales, led by Industrial and Transportation at 14.3 percent, Safety, Security and Protection Services at 9.4 percent, Consumer and Office at 6.1 percent, and Health Care at 5.4 percent. A slowdown in electronics-related businesses negatively impacted both the Electro and Communications and Display and Graphics business segments. Electro and Communications sales decreased 2.7 percent and Display and Graphics sales declined 8.8 percent. Sales declined 17 percent in optical systems, which is part of Display and Graphics, impacted by end-market weakness and lower attachment rates in LCD TVs. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2011 sales increased in every major geographic region, with Latin America/Canada up 9.7 percent, the U.S. up 7.4 percent, EMEA up 4.4 percent, and Asia Pacific up 2.8 percent. Excluding optical systems, Asia Pacific sales increased 7.6 percent. Of the 5.7 percent worldwide sales growth, 3.3 points was from the combined impact of higher organic volume of 1.3 points and selling price growth of 2.0 points, 2.3 points was from acquisitions, and 0.1 points was from favorable currency effects. Organic volume growth of 1.3 percent reflected slower growth in Asia Pacific, partially due to weakness across the electronics market and slower growth in China, in addition to weakness in Western Europe. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2011, sales increased 11.1 percent to $29.6 billion, led by Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services, and Health Care. All major geographic regions showed improvement, led by Latin America/Canada. The increase in global sales reflected improved market penetration and new product flow along with significant growth in important end-markets such as general industrial and personal safety. Net income attributable to 3M was $4.283 billion, or $5.96 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $4.085 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, in 2010 (including the first-quarter 2010 special item discussed below). \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring 2011, 3M was impacted by the first-quarter earthquake and tsunami in Japan and by the fourth-quarter flooding in Thailand. Automobile and electronic manufacturers were most impacted; thus, 3M&#146;s automotive OEM and electronics-related businesses were most affected. 3M estimates that combined direct and indirect business disruption resulting from the 2011 Japan natural disaster, net of the benefit from sales of 3M products used in the reconstruction efforts and initial insurance recoveries, plus the impact of Thailand flooding, reduced 2011 sales growth by an estimated 0.8 percentage points and earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share, with most of this impact in the first half of 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the flooding in Thailand reduced sales growth by an estimated $35 million and operating income by $20 million, with this operating income effect offset by $23 million in insurance recoveries related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Japan represented approximately 9 percent of total 3M sales for total year 2011. Related to these natural disasters, no material asset or investment impairments were recorded. In addition, 3M did not have any significant issues related to these natural disasters concerning inventories, customer receivables, lease terminations, environmental exposures, guarantees, indemnifications, debt covenant compliance, or significant tax issues. 3M does have certain \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ninsurance coverage which limited its exposure and resulted in some initial recovery in the fourth quarter of 2011 (as discussed above). \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, 3M recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. In addition to the discussion below, refer to the section entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; and &#147;Performance by Geographic Area&#148; later in MD&#38;A for a more detailed discussion of the sales and income results of the Company and its respective business segments (including Corporate and Unallocated).

Sales declined 0.5 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 2.4 percent in Electro and Communications and 3.1 percent in Display and Graphics. Total company organic l ocal-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) was 2.6 percent, acquisitions added 0.8 percent, and foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 2.4 percent. Five of 3M&#146;s six business segments posted operating income margins in excess of 21 percent in 2012. Worldwide operating income margins for 2012 were 21.7 percent, compared to 20.9 percent for 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in 2011 increased 11.1 percent, led by Industrial and Transportation at 19.5 percent, Safety, Security and Protection Services at 15.2 percent, and Health Care at 11.5 percent. Electro and Communications sales increased 8.6 percent and Consumer and Office sales increased 7.8 percent. Sales declined 5.4 percent in Display and Graphics, due to fewer orders for optical films. Total company organic local-currency sales growth was 4.7 percent, acquisitions added 3.3 percent, and foreign currency impacts added 3.1 percent. 3M&#146;s six business segments all posted operating income margins in excess of 20 percent in 2011 and 2010. Worldwide operating income margins for 2011 were 20.9 percent, compared to 22.2 percent for 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M generated $5.3 billion of operating cash flow in 2012, an increase of $16 million when compared to 2011. This followed an increase of $110 million when comparing 2011 to 2010. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#148; later in MD&#38;A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company&#146;s previous repurchase program. This new program has no pre-established end date. In 2012, the Company purchased $2.204 billion of treasury stock, compared to $2.701 billion in 2011 and $854 million in 2010. In February 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 7.6 percent for 2013, marking the 55th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M&#146;s debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 25 percent at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. 3M has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. The Company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital markets to meet its funding needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2012, the Company experienced stable to declining cost for most raw material categories and transportation fuel costs. This was driven by year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nminerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M&#146;s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2012. The U.S. qualified plans, which are approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, were 96 percent funded, the international pension plans were 81 percent funded, and the U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded. Asset returns in 2012 for the U.S. qualified plan were 13.6%. For the U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2013 is 8.00%, a decrease of 0.25 percentage points from 2012. The U.S. qualified plan year-end 2012 discount rate was 4.14%, down 0.01 percentage points from the year-end 2011 discount rate of 4.15%. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $400 million to $600 million of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2013. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2013. 3M expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2013 to decrease by approximately $100 million pre-tax, or approximately 10 cents per diluted share, when compared to 2012. Refer to &#147;Critical Accounting Estimates&#148; within MD&#38;A and Note 10 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M&#146;s pension and post-retirement plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere are a few major items that will impact earnings in 2013. As discussed further above, 3M expects that a decrease in pension and postretirement expense will increase 2013 earnings, when compared to 2012, by approximately 10 cents per diluted share. 3M currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2013 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.0 percent, compared to 29.0 percent for 2012. 3M expects to incur restructuring and one-time acquisition costs of approximately $30 million in the first quarter of 2013. Currency effects are not expected to have a material impact on earnings in 2013. Considering these items, 3M currently expects that sales growth and related incremental income, in addition to other benefits, should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled &#147;Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results&#148; in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecial Items: \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecial items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in the Company&#146;s underlying operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, 3M recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Act&#148;). The charge is due to a reduction in the value of the company&#146;s deferred tax asset as a result of the Act&#146;s change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements. This item is discussed in more detail in Note 7 (Income Taxes). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntl. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,376 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,904 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,028 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,583 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29,611 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n35.2 \n\n% \n\n64.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n33.9 \n\n% \n\n66.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n0.8 \n\n% \n\n1.2 \n\n% \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n3.5 \n\n% \n\n3.7 \n\n% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.6 \n\n) \n\n(2.4 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n(1.1 \n\n)% \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\n8.9 \n\n% \n\n12.2 \n\n% \n\n11.1 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn 2012, organic local-currency sales increased 2.6 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth was led by Latin America/Canada and the United States, while Asia Pacific was flat, and EMEA was down slightly. Worldwide or ganic local-currency sales grew 4.7 percent in Health Care, 4.5 percent in Industrial and Transportation, 3.8 percent in Consumer and Office, and 2.2 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services. Organic local-currency sales declined 0.8 percent in Electro and Communications and 2.4 percent in Display and Graphics. Acquisitions added 0.8 percent to worldwide growth and currency impacts reduced 2012 worldwide sales growth by 2.4 percent. Worldwide selling prices rose 1.4 percent in 2012, despite selling price declines in 3M&#146;s optical systems business, where prices typically decline each year, which is common for the electronics industry. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2011, organic local-currency sales increased 4.7 percent. All major geographic areas showed organic local-currency sales increases, led by Latin America/Canada and the United States. Worldwide organic local-currency sales grew 10.0 percent in Industrial and Transportation, 7.1 percent in Safety, Security and Protection Services, 5.2 percent in Electro and Communications, 4.6 percent in Health Care, and 4.0 percent in Consumer and Office. Organic local-currency sales declined 7.5 percent in Display and Graphics. Acquisitions added 3.3 percent to worldwide growth and currency impacts benefited 2011 worldwide sales growth by 3.1 percent. Worldwide selling prices rose 1.0 percent in 2011, despite selling price declines in 3M&#146;s optical systems business. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to the sections entitled &#147;Performance by Business Segment&#148; and &#147;Performance by Geographic Area&#148; later in MD&#38;A for additional discussion of sales change. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Percent of net sales) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 Versus 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 Versus 2010 \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n52.4 \n\n% \n\n53.0 \n\n% \n\n51.9 \n\n% \n\n(0.6 \n\n)% \n\n1.1 \n\n% \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n20.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n20.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n20.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4 \n\n) \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n5.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n21.7 \n\n% \n\n20.9 \n\n% \n\n22.2 \n\n% \n\n0.8 \n\n% \n\n(1.3 \n\n)% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPension and postretirement expense increased in both 2012 and 2011. The year-on-year increases for 2012 compared to 2011, and 2011 compared to 2010, were $95 million and $233 million, respectively. The year-on-year increase in 2012 includes a $26 million charge related to the first-quarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program (discussed in Note 10). These increases negatively impacted cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A); and research, development and related expenses (R&#38;D). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. Cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 52.4 percent in 2012, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points from 2011. The net impact of selling price/raw material cost changes was the primary factor that decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales, as selling prices increased 1.4 percent and raw material costs decreased approximately 2 percent. This benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 53.0 percent in 2011, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from 2010. On a dollar basis, selling price increases largely offset raw material inflation for total year 2011, as selling prices increased 1 percent year-on-year and raw material prices increased approximately 4 percent year-on-year. However, measured as a percent of sales, selling price/raw material impacts accounted for approximately 0.5 percentage points of the cost of sales increase. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales was also negatively impacted by higher pension and postretirement costs. These impacts were partially offset by organic sales volume growth of 3.7 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) expenses decreased $68 million, or 1.1 percent, in 2012 when compared to 2011. In addition to cost-control and other productivity efforts, 3M experienced some savings from its first-quarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program and other restructuring actions. These benefits more than offset increases related to acquisitions, higher year-on-year pension and postretirement expense, and restructuring expenses. SG&#38;A in 2012 included increases from acquired businesses which were not in 3M&#146;s full-year 2011 base spending, primarily related to the 2011 acquisitions of Winterthur Technologie AG and the do-it-yourself and professional business of GPI Group, in addition to SG&#38;A spending related to the 2012 acquisitions of Ceradyne, Inc., Federal Signal Technologies Group, and CodeRyte, Inc. SG&#38;A, measured as a percent of sales, was 20.4 percent in 2012, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points when compared to 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nSG&#38;A expenses increased 13 percent in 2011 when compared to 2010, due to several factors. Approximately 5 percentage points of this growth in SG&#38;A was due to increases from acquired businesses not in 3M&#146;s full year 2010 base spending, which primarily related to SG&#38;A spending for the Winterthur Technologie AG, Arizant Inc., Cogent Inc. and Attenti Holdings S.A. acquisitions. Another 3 percentage points of growth in 2011 SG&#38;A was due to foreign exchange effects, which resulted in higher translated costs from 3M&#146;s non-U.S. subsidiaries. Finally, 2011 SG&#38;A increased in part due to higher year-on-year pension and postretirement expense and continued investments to support future growth, such as sales representatives, advertising and promotional investments. SG&#38;A expenses, measured as a percent of net sales, increased 0.3 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&#38;D) increased 4.1 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased 9.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, as 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives. In 2012, these investments, along with higher pension and postretirement expense, were partially offset by cost-control efforts and savings from 3M&#146;s first-quarter 2012 voluntary early retirement incentive program. In 2011, R&#38;D expense increased versus 2010 due to R&#38;D related to businesses acquired in the last 12 months, foreign exchange effects, and higher pension and postretirement expense, in addition to 3M&#146;s continued investment in new products. R&#38;D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.5 percent in 2012, compared to 5.3 percent in 2011 and 5.4 percent in 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Operating income was 21.7 percent of sales in 2012, compared to 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, an improvement of 0.8 percentage points. The improvement was driven by a 1.6 percentage point benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. This was partially offset by increased pension/postretirement benefit costs and acquisition impacts, each of which reduced margins by 0.3 percentage points, and other net impacts, which decreased margins by 0.2 percentage points. Operating income was 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, compared to 22.2 percent of sales in 2010, primarily due to higher cost of sales (as a percent of sales) in 2011 when compared to 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Expense and Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n(39 \n\n) \n\n(39 \n\n) \n\n(38 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInterest Expense : Interest expense decreased in both 2012 and 2011. The 2012 decrease was driven by lower average international debt balances, while the 2011 decrease was attributable to lower U.S. debt balances. Both years were favorably impacted by lower interest rates on U.S. debt. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Income: In 2012, lower U.S. cash balances and lower interest rates internationally were offset by higher international cash balances and higher interest rates in the U.S. In 2011, interest income increased slightly, as higher international cash balances and better investment yields were largely offset by a lower U.S. cash balance. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for Income Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Percent of pre-tax income) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n29.0 \n\n% \n\n27.8 \n\n% \n\n27.7 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2012 was 29.0 percent, compared to 27.8 percent in 2011, an increase of 1.2 percentage points. Various factors increased or decreased the effective tax rate when compared to the same periods last year. The primary factors that increased the Company&#146;s effective tax rate year-on-year include international taxes, specifically with respect to the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary (which benefited 2011), state income taxes, lower domestic manufacturer&#146;s deduction, and the lapse of the U.S. research and development credit. These and other factors, when compared to 2011, increased the 2012 effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points. Factors that decreased the Company&#146;s effective tax rate year-on-year include international taxes as a result of changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes and adjustments to its income tax reserves. These factors, when compared to last year, decreased the effective tax rate 0.9 percentage points. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.8 percent, compared to 27.7 percent in 2010, an increase of 0.1 percentage points. The year-on-year change in international income taxes increased the effective tax rate for 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 2.5 percentage points, which includes a partial offsetting benefit from the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary in 2011. This 2.5 percentage point net increase was due primarily to certain 2010 tax benefits, which did not repeat in 2011, related to net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance resulting from the 2010 corporate alignment transactions that allowed the Company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary. These transactions are described in the section of Note 5 entitled &#147;Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Shares and Transfers of Ownership Interest Involving Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries&#148;. Other significant items impacting the year-on-year comparison include a one-time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million, which benefited the 2011 tax rate when compared to 2010 by 1.5 percentage points, as this charge did not repeat in 2011. The Company&#146;s effective tax rate also benefited during 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 0.7 percentage points from adjustments to its income tax reserves. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law. Included in this Act was the extension of the research and development credit for years 2012 and 2013. As this Act was enacted during 2013, the impacts of this law are not included in the 2012 financial results. The Company anticipates a beneficial impact on the effective tax rate in 2013 for both the 2012 and 2013 research and development credit. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2013 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.0 percent. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 7 for further discussion of income taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which is 3M&#146;s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As of December 31, 2012, 3M&#146;s effective ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited is 75 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $103 million in 2012 and increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $154 million in 2011. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased net income attributable to 3M by approximately $49 million in 2012 and had an immaterial impact on net income attributable to 3M in 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDisclosures relating to 3M&#146;s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reportable segments are Industrial and Transportation; Health Care; Consumer and Office; Safety, Security and Protection Services; Display and Graphics; and Electro and Communications. Information related to 3M&#146;s business segments is presented in the tables that follow. Organic local-currency sales include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts. Acquisition impacts are measured separately for the first twelve months of the acquisition. The acquisition and divestiture impacts, if any, foreign currency translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each business segment. Any references to EMEA relate to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to these six operating business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to &#147;Corporate and Unallocated,&#148; which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 15. Corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. The primary items driving higher expenses in Corporate and Unallocated in 2012 when compared to 2011 were pension and postretirement expense, as a portion of the 2012 increase in these expenses were not allocated directly to the six operating business segments ($63 million), and the impact of an increase in other environmental insurance receivables, which benefited 2012 by $15 million (as discussed in Note 13). The impacts of changes in respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and receivables netted to a $32 million charge in 2012, which was similar to 2011, resulting in a minimal year-on-year effect. The primary item driving higher 2011 expenses when compared to 2010 relates to pension and postretirement expense, as a portion of the 2011 increase in these expenses was not allocated directly to the six operating business segments. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following discusses total year results for 2012 compared to 2011, and also discusses 2011 compared to 2010, for each business segment. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial and Transportation Business (34.6% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,346 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,073 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,429 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n4.5 \n\n% \n\n10.0 \n\n% \n\n17.0 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.9 \n\n) \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n19.5 \n\n% \n\n18.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,258 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,057 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,754 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n9.8 \n\n% \n\n17.3 \n\n% \n\n42.6 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n20.4 \n\n% \n\n20.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Industrial and Transportation segment serves a broad range of markets, such as automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and automotive aftermarket (auto body shops and retail), renewable energy, electronics, paper and packaging, food and beverage, and appliance. Industrial and Transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, energy control products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Industrial and Transportation totaled $10.3 billion, up 2.7 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.5 percent, acquisitions added 1.1 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2.9 percent. Acquisitions growth was primarily driven by Winterthur Technologie AG (Winterthur) in the abrasives market, Ceradyne, Inc. (Ceradyne) in the advanced technical ceramics market, and Alpha Beta Enterprise Co. Ltd. (Alpha Beta) in industrial tapes, all of which are discussed further below. On an organic local-currency basis, sales growth was strongest in automotive OEM, aerospace, abrasives and filtration. On an organic local-currency basis, sales declined in renewable energy, impacted by weak end market demand. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeographically, organic local-currency sales increased 7 percent in both the United States and Latin America/Canada, 3.5 percent in Asia Pacific, and 1 percent in EMEA. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income was $2.3 billion in 2012, 9.8 percent higher than 2011, with the primary benefit related to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases. Operating income growth was led by the United States. Operating income margins increased by 1.4 percentage points to 21.8 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs disclosed in Note 2, in November 2012, 3M acquired Ceradyne, Inc. (Ceradyne), which is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California. Ceradyne is involved in the development and production of advanced technical ceramics for demanding applications in the automotive, oil and gas, solar, industrial, electronics and defense industries. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2011 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Industrial and Transportation increased 19.5 percent to $10.1 billion, with 10.0 percent of this increase attributable to organic local-currency growth. Acquisitions increased sales by 5.9 percent, primarily driven by Winterthur and Alpha Beta (discussed below). Foreign currency impacts added 3.6 percent to 2011 sales growth. Geographically, sales increased in all major regions, led by Asia Pacific and Europe. Organic local-currency sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio, led by renewable energy, aerospace and aircraft maintenance, energy and advanced materials, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes. In addition, despite the Japan and Thailand natural disasters, 3M also achieved growth in its automotive aftermarket and automotive OEM businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M continued to invest in its Industrial and Transportation business. In March 2011, 3M acquired a controlling interest in Winterthur via completion of a public tender offer. Winterthur, based in Zug, Switzerland, is a leading global supplier of precision grinding technology serving customers in the area of hard-to-grind precision applications in industrial, automotive, aircraft, and cutting tools. In addition, in February 2011, 3M completed its acquisition of the tape-related assets of Alpha Beta, a leading manufacturer of box sealing tape and masking tape headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income was $2.1 billion in 2011, 17.3 percent higher than 2010. 3M achieved operating income margins of 20.4 percent, even with continued investments to support growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2005, 3M&#146;s automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of TI&#38;M Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (TI&#38;M) for approximately $55 million. TI&#38;M is the parent company of I&#38;T Innovation Technology Entwicklungsund Holding Aktiengesellschaft (I&#38;T), an Austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, 3M marketed I&#38;T&#146;s flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. I&#38;T filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in August 2006. As part of its agreement to purchase the shares of TI&#38;M, the Company was granted a put option that gave the Company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in TI&#38;M to the other investors from whom the Company acquired its 19 percent interest. The put option became exercisable January 1, 2007. The Company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in Belgium in February 2007. The other two TI&#38;M investors from whom the Company purchased its shares filed a bankruptcy petition in Austria in January 2007. The Company has recovered approximately 6.7 million Euros through the Austrian bankruptcy process. The Company then pursued recovery from the bank that held the 3M purchase price paid to the two bankrupt investors, and in March 2012 recovered 4.5 million Euros, leaving a balance of 7.4 million Euros (approximately $10 million). In September 2012, 3M Austria commenced proceedings in the Commercial Court of Vienna against the co-sellers of the shares to recover the remaining balance plus accrued interest pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement and Austrian law. The Company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care Business (17.3% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,158 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,031 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,513 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n3.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5 \n\n) \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n2.5 \n\n% \n\n11.5 \n\n% \n\n5.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,646 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,489 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,362 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n10.6 \n\n% \n\n9.3 \n\n% \n\n1.1 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n31.9 \n\n% \n\n29.6 \n\n% \n\n30.2 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Health Care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, health information systems, and food manufacturing and testing. Products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, inhalation and transdermal drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products (oral care), health information systems, and food safety products. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care sales totaled $5.2 billion, an increase of 2.5 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.7 percent, led by food safety, health information systems, and skin/wound care. Sales declined year-on-year in drug delivery systems. Acquisitions added 0.3 percent, as 3M further strengthened its health information systems business in April 2012 by acquiring CodeRyte, Inc., which provides clinical natural language processing technology and computer-assisted coding solutions for outpatient providers. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2.5 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales increased 12.5 percent in Latin America/Canada, 10 percent in Asia Pacific, 4 percent in the United States, and 1 percent in EMEA. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income increased 10.6 percent to $1.6 billion. Operating income margins were 31.9 percent in 2012 compared to 29.6 percent in 2011, driven by strong manufacturing cost control, improved utilization and production efficiencies. Operating income grew in all major geographic areas. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2011 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth Care sales increased 11.5 percent to $5.0 billion. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.6 percent and acquisition added 3.8 percent. Acquisition growth primarily related to Arizant Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia in surgical settings. Currency impacts increased sales by 3.1 percent in Health Care. On a geographic basis, all regions posted positive sales growth. Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and Europe all reported sales growth of 10 percent or more, while the U.S. grew at 9 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth increased in the food safety, health information systems, infection prevention, skin and wound care, and oral care businesses. Sales in the drug-delivery systems business increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, but were down slightly for total-year 2011 when compared to 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in Health Care increased 9.3 percent in 2011 to $1.5 billion. Operating income margins were 29.6 percent, compared to 30.2 percent in 2010, with this decrease due in part to growth investments in the health information systems and infection prevention businesses. 3M also invested in emerging markets to improve market penetration levels. The year-on-year decline in operating income margins was also due in part to sales declines in drug delivery systems. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer and Office Business (14.4% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,316 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,153 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,853 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n3.8 \n\n% \n\n4.0 \n\n% \n\n7.1 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n2.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n2.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n) \n\n2.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n3.9 \n\n% \n\n7.8 \n\n% \n\n11.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n10.8 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n% \n\n12.3 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.6 \n\n% \n\n20.2 \n\n% \n\n21.8 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Consumer and Office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, home improvement, building maintenance and other markets. Products in this segment include office supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement products (do-it-yourself), home care products, protective material products, certain consumer retail personal safety products, and consumer health care products. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Consumer and Office totaled $4.3 billion, up 3.9 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 3.8 percent, acquisitions added 2.0 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.9 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth was led by the consumer health care and construction and home improvement businesses. Organic local-currency sales increased slightly in stationery and office supplies, impacted by continued softness in the office wholesale and retail markets. Acquisition growth was largely due to the October 2011 acquisition of the do-it-yourself and professional business of GPI Group. GPI is a manufacturer and marketer of home improvement products such as tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products and accessories. The addition of GPI&#146;s products expands 3M&#146;s product portfolio in core and complementary categories in the construction and home improvement markets. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales increased 9.5 percent in Latin America/Canada, 5 percent in Asia Pacific, and 4 percent in the United States. EMEA organic local-currency sales decreased 2 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer and Office operating income increased 10.8 percent to $930 million. Operating income margins were 21.6 percent, compared to 20.2 percent in 2011, as all businesses and major geographic areas posted operating income increases. Consumer and Office benefited from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, in addition to cost-control efforts. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn December 2011, 3M (Consumer and Office Business) entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Office and Consumer Products business of Avery Dennison Corp. (Avery). 3M and Avery withdrew from the regulatory approval process for this acquisition in September 2012 and subsequently announced that they had terminated this agreement in October 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2011 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Consumer and Office increased 7.8 percent in 2011 to $4.2 billion, with all businesses posting positive sales growth. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.0 percent and acquisitions added 1.4 percent. Acquisition growth was largely due to the October 2011 acquisition of the do-it-yourself and professional business of GPI Group and the April 2010 acquisition of the A-One branded label business and related operations. A-One is the largest branded label business in Asia and the second largest worldwide. 3M also acquired Hybrivet Systems Inc. in the first quarter of 2011, a provider of instant-read products to detect lead and other contaminants and toxins. Foreign currency impacts contributed 2.4 percent to sales growth in the Consumer and Office segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a geographic basis, sales increased in all regions, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada and Europe, which all had sales growth rates in excess of 10 percent. U.S. sales also grew, albeit at a slower rate. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer and Office operating income was flat when comparing 2011 to 2010, reflecting continued ongoing investments in developing economies in brand development and marketing and sales coverage. Even with these investments, Consumer and Office generated operating income margins of 20.2 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety, Security and Protection Services Business (12.7% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,802 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,821 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,316 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n% \n\n7.1 \n\n% \n\n6.1 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.7 \n\n) \n\n3.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5 \n\n)% \n\n15.2 \n\n% \n\n7.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\n14.9 \n\n% \n\n(2.6 \n\n)% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n22.3 \n\n% \n\n21.3 \n\n% \n\n21.4 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Safety, Security and Protection Services segment serves a broad range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. Major product offerings include personal protection products, cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, safety and security products (including border and civil security solutions), roofing granules for asphalt shingles, infrastructure protection products used in the oil and gas pipeline markets, and track and trace solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety, Security and Protection Services sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 0.5 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales grew 2.2 percent and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2.7 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth was led by infrastructure protection and personal safety, with growth also in building and commercial services and roofing granules. \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 organic local-currency sales declined 18 percent in security systems, as government spending for security solutions has been declining over the last few years. As discussed later in the &#147;Critical Accounting Estimates&#148; section, 3M will continue to monitor this business to assess whether long-term expectations have been significantly impacted such that an asset or goodwill impairment test would be required. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2012, with no impairment indicated. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeographically, organic local-currency sales increased 19 percent in Latin America/Canada. Organic local-currency sales were flat in Asia Pacific and the United States, and declined 2 percent in EMEA. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe combination of selling price increases and raw material cost reductions, plus factory efficiencies, drove a 4.1 percent increase in operating income. Operating income margins increased 1.0 percentage points to 22.3 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2011 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSafety, Security and Protection Services sales increased 15.2 percent in 2011. H1N1-related comparisons reduced 2011 sales growth by 2.5 percent, as 3M generated sales related to the H1N1 virus in the first three quarters of 2010. Even with this difficult comparison, organic local-currency sales growth was 7.1 percent. Acquisitions added 4.7 percent, with this benefit primarily related to Attenti Holdings S.A. and Cogent Inc., which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010. Attenti Holdings S.A. is a supplier of remote people-monitoring technologies used for offender-monitoring applications and to assist eldercare facilities in monitoring and enhancing the safety of patients. Cogent Inc. is a provider of finger, palm, face and iris biometric systems for governments, law enforcement agencies, and commercial enterprises. Foreign currency effects added 3.4 percent to 2011 sales. All geographic regions posted positive sales growth, with sales growth led by Asia Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and the U.S. These three regions all had sales growth in excess of 15 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales increased in all businesses. Sales dollar increases were largest in personal protection products, security systems, building and commercial services, and infrastructure protection.

The optical film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones and tablets 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3M&#146;s optical film patents expire at the end of 2013 and over several years thereafter, 3M will likely see more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3M&#146;s proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2012 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Display and Graphics were $3.6 billion, down 3.1 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales decreased 2.4 percent, as optical systems sales declined 10 percent, driven by lower optical film volumes for LCD TVs. Organic local-currency sales increased in both commercial graphics and architectural markets and were up slightly in traffic safety systems. Acquisitions added 0.9 percent to sales growth. This related to the September 2012 purchase of assets that comprised the business of Federal Signal Technologies Group from Federal Signal Corp. This business focuses on electronic toll collection and parking management hardware and software services. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.6 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales increased 11 percent in Latin America/Canada and 6 percent in the United States. Organic local-currency sales declined 4 percent in EMEA and 6 percent in Asia Pacific, where the decrease in optical systems sales was a major factor. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2012 totaled $693 million, down 12.1 percent. Operating income margins were 19.5 percent of sales, compared to 21.5 percent in 2011. The year-on-year decline was largely attributable to the decline in optical systems, along with softness in traffic safety systems, which has been impacted by lower government spending. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2011 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in Display and Graphics were $3.7 billion in 2011, a decline of 5.4 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales declined 7.5 percent. Acquisitions added 0.1 percent to sales growth and foreign currency impacts increased sales by 2.0 percent. Optical Systems sales decreased 17 percent due to lower year-on-year LCD TV-related sales over the last three quarters of 2011. Sales grew in commercial graphics and architectural markets. Traffic safety systems also posted sales growth, which was all currency related. Sales increased in Latin America/Canada and the U.S., but declined in Europe. Sales also declined in Asia Pacific, where the decline in optical systems sales was a major factor. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2011 totaled $788 million, down 16.6 percent from 2010. 3M achieved 21.5 percent operating income margins in this business segment, as productivity improvements helped to partially offset negative impacts from lower sales of optical films for LCD TVs, impacted by LCD TV volume reductions, as well as continued LCD selling price declines. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nElectro and Communications Business (10.8% of consolidated sales): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,228 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,306 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,043 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales change analysis: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local currency \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8 \n\n)% \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n26.1 \n\n% \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4 \n\n) \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.6 \n\n) \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4 \n\n)% \n\n8.6 \n\n% \n\n27.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8 \n\n)% \n\n6.2 \n\n% \n\n90.6 \n\n% \n\nPercent of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.4 \n\n% \n\n21.5 \n\n% \n\n22.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Electro and Communications segment serves the electrical, electronics and communications industries, including electrical utilities; electrical construction, maintenance and repair; original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electrical and electronics; computers and peripherals; consumer electronics; telecommunications central office, outside plant and enterprise; as well as aerospace, military, automotive and medical markets; with products that enable the efficient transmission of electrical power and speed the delivery of information.

Sales expanded in all geographic regions, led by greater than 10 percent sales increases in both Europe and Latin America/Canada. From a business standpoint, sales growth was led by 3M&#146;s electronics markets materials business and the electrical markets business. The telecom business also posted solid sales growth, while sales declined in the electronic solutions business. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income increased 6.2 percent to $712 million in 2011, driven by higher year-on-year sales growth.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M&#146;s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M&#146;s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 16. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of key information and discussion related to 3M&#146;s geographic areas follow: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited States \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia Pacific \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin America/ Canada \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Unallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,092 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,730 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,572 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(18 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n29,904 \n\n&#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n35.2 \n\n% \n\n30.4 \n\n% \n\n22.5 \n\n% \n\n11.9 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#151; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n1.3 \n\n% \n\n(2.8 \n\n)% \n\n6.9 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 \n\n% \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.2 \n\n) \n\n2.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.6 \n\n) \n\n10.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n1.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.6 \n\n) \n\n(6.2 \n\n) \n\n(6.3 \n\n) \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4 \n\n) \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\n(4.9 \n\n)% \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,929 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,450 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,163 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(4 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n6,483 \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n18.4 \n\n% \n\n(2.9 \n\n)% \n\n1.2 \n\n% \n\n5.5 \n\n% \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor total year 2012, as shown in the preceding table, sales rose 1.0 percent, with organic volume increases of 1.2 percent and selling price increases of 1.4 percent.

In addition, the other primary factor that increased employment in both years was additions in developing economies to support growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending was $1.484 billion in 2012, compared to $1.379 billion in 2011 and $1.091 billion in 2010. The Company expects 2013 capital spending to be approximately $1.6 to $1.8 billion, as 3M continues to invest in its businesses. In 2012, 3M expanded manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, particularly with respect to international and emerging market countries. This included investments in China, Turkey and Poland, in addition to investments in Singapore and the U.S. 3M also increased investments in IT systems and infrastructure and made strategic investments in research/development infrastructure and manufacturing sites to lay the foundation for future growth. In 2011, a large portion of the capital investment was used to address supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. In addition, some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. In 2010, in the U.S., 3M invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non-optical businesses which use similar technology. Also, in 2010, 3M increased capacity at its multi-purpose manufacturing facility in Singapore and invested in optical film capacity in Korea. Lastly, in 2010, investments in the Industrial and Transportation business included solar energy in the U.S. and industrial adhesives and tapes in China. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is striving to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capacity, particularly in developing economies, in order to more closely align its production capability with its sales in major geographic regions. The initiative is expected to help improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements. 3M will continue to make investments in critical emerging markets, such as China and India, including plans to establish and begin production in a new wholly-owned manufacturing entity in India to serve as a source of supply to 3M&#146;s business in India and in other countries. \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company&#146;s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLegal Proceedings: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled &#147;Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings&#148; (contained in &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; in Note 13) for additional information about such estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation &#151; Retirement Benefits , in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders&#146; equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant&#146;s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. See Note 10 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.14% for U.S. pension and 4.00% for U.S. postretirement benefits to be appropriate as of December 31, 2012, which represents a decrease from the 4.15% and 4.04% rates, respectively, used as of December 31, 2011. The weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of December 31, 2012 was 3.78%, a decrease from the 4.58% rate used as of December 31, 2011. \n\n&#160; \n\nA significant element in determining the Company&#146;s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. pension plan, the 2013 expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2013 is 8.00%, a 0.25% decrease from 2012. Refer to Note 10 for information on how the 2013 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.87% for 2013, compared to 6.38% for 2012. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized total consolidated pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $650 million, up from $555 million in 2011. Pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to decrease to approximately $550 million in 2013, a decrease of $100 million compared to 2012. For the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease/increase 2013 pension expense by approximately $33 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $13 million for international pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2013 pension expense by approximately $37 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $19 million for international pension plans. In addition, a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2013 pension expense by approximately $39 million for U.S. pension plans and approximately $21 million for international pension plans. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsset Impairments: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2012, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.4 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.9 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2012. 3M&#146;s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3M has six business segments at December 31, 2012), but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. \n\n&#160; \n\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective in the first quarter of 2012, 3M made certain product moves across divisions within its business segments, but none were across business segments. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2012 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2012, 3M had 36 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 77 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M Purification Inc., Occupational Health and Environmental Safety, Optical Systems, Security Systems, Infection Prevention, 3M ESPE, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Communication Markets, Health Information Systems, and Abrasive Systems. The fair values for all these significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 50 percent or more. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2012, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management&#146;s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. \n\n&#160; \n\nBased on fourth-quarter 2012 testing, 3M&#146;s estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately $77 billion, implying a control premium of 21 percent when compared to 3M&#146;s market value of approximately $64 billion at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012. The control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3M&#146;s total Company estimated fair value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total Company. 3M&#146;s market value at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $18 billion. 3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M&#146;s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M&#146;s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M&#146;s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2012, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. \n\n&#160; \n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. Given the current overall economic and other conditions in markets served by certain reporting units and asset groups within these reporting units (particularly Security \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSystems Division), 3M will continue to monitor conditions to assess whether long term expectations have been significantly impacted such that future interim impairment tests would be required. As of December 31, 2012, 3M had approximately $600 million of goodwill and approximately $300 million of long-lived assets related to Security Systems. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2013 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe extent of 3M&#146;s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 7 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company&#146;s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company&#146;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. \n\n&#160; \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \n\n&#160; \n\nAs indicated in the following table, at December 31, 2012, 3M had $5.693 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $6.001 billion of debt. Debt included $4.916 billion of long-term debt, $986 million related to the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings of $99 million. The current portion of long-term debt includes $850 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes due in August 2013. 3M repaid $500 million (principal amount) of medium term notes that matured in December 2012. As discussed in Note 9, in June 2012, 3M issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate notes due 2017 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of ten-year fixed rate notes due 2022. The strength of 3M&#146;s capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3M reliable access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company&#146;s maturity profile is staggered to ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company generates significant ongoing operating cash flow, which has been used, in part, to pay dividends on 3M common stock, for acquisitions, and to fund share repurchase activities. As discussed in Note 2, in 2012 3M acquired Ceradyne, Inc. and other acquisitions for approximately $1 billion. In 2011, 3M acquired Winterthur Technologie AG and other acquisitions for approximately $700 million (including purchases of noncontrolling interest). 3M was able to complete these acquisitions while maintaining a strong net debt position, as shown in the table below. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START At December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,001 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,166 \n\n&#160; \n\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; \n\n5,693 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,576 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations. This measure is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2012 totaled approximately $5.7 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of $5.3 billion. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held internationally totaled $3.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, and in the United States totaled $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Cash available in the United States has historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, in addition to funding U.S. acquisitions, U.S. capital spending, U.S. pension/other postemployment benefit contributions, and other items as needed. For those international earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no intention to repatriate these funds. If these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, for the international funds considered to be reinvested indefinitely, 3M&#146;s current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. Refer to Note 7 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s financial condition and liquidity are strong. Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $7.430 billion at December 31, 2012, compared with $6.799 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $631 million. Working capital increases in cash, cash equivalents, current marketable securities, inventories and accounts receivable were partially offset by increases in all major current liability accounts, especially short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt. \n\n&#160; \n\nPrimary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand, U.S. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. The Company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3M to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, 3M had no outstanding commercial paper. The Company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s and an Aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody&#146;s Investors Service. In September 2012, 3M entered into a $1.5 billion, five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, which amended the existing agreement that was entered into in August 2011. This amended agreement extended the expiration date from August 2016 to September 2017. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $500 million, bringing the total facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders&#146; discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2012. In August 2012, 3M entered into a $150 million, one-year committed letter of credit facility with HSBC Bank USA, which replaced the one-year $200 million committed credit facility that was entered into in August 2011. As of December 31, 2012, 3M letters of credit issued under this $150 million committed facility totaled $121 million. In December 2012, 3M entered into a three-year 66 million British Pound (approximately $106 million) committed credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, which is fully drawn as of December 31, 2012. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $100 million in stand-alone letters of credit are also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2012. The Company also utilized $37 million in international lines of credit and $6 million in U.S. lines of credit with other banking partners as of December 31, 2012. These letters of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities. Under both the $1.5 billion and $150 million credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2012, this ratio was approximately 45 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has a &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; shelf registration statement, effective August 5, 2011, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. In September 2011, in connection with this August 5, 2011 shelf registration statement, 3M established a $3 billion medium-term notes program (Series F), from which 3M issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes with a coupon rate of 1.375%. In June 2012, 3M issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-notes due 2017 with a coupon rate of 1.000% and $600 million aggregate principal amount of ten-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2022 with a coupon rate of 2.000%, which were both issued from this $3 billion medium-term notes program (Series F). The designated use of these proceeds is for general corporate purposes. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#146;s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2012 totaled $2.883 billion, with an additional $2.810 billion in current and long-term marketable securities. 3M&#146;s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3M paid dividends of $1.635 billion in 2012, and has a long history of dividend increases. In February 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors increased the quarterly \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ndividend on 3M common stock by 7.6 percent to 63.5 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.54 per share. In February 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, replacing the Company&#146;s existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2013, the Company plans to contribute an amount in the range of $400 million to $600 million of cash to its U.S. and international pension and postretirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2013. Therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the U.S. qualified plans&#146; funded status as of the 2013 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. Future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales &#151; fourth quarter at year-end &#151; multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 4.8 at December 31, 2012, a decline from 5.0 at December 31, 2011. Receivables increased $194 million, or 5.0 percent, compared with December 31, 2011, driven by a year-on-year increase in fourth quarter sales. Acquisitions increased accounts receivable by $84 million and currency translation decreased accounts receivable by $23 million. Inventories increased $421 million, or 12.3 percent, compared with December 31, 2011, with the increases partially attributable to an increase in demand in the fourth-quarter of 2012 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Acquisitions increased inventories by $125 million, while currency translation increased inventories by $46 million. Accounts payable increased $119 million compared with December 31, 2011. Acquisitions increased the accounts payable balance by $26 million, while currency translation increased accounts payable by $13 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income including noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,511 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,357 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,163 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n1,288 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,236 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,120 \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany pension contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,079 \n\n) \n\n(517 \n\n) \n\n(556 \n\n) \n\nCompany postretirement contributions \n\n&#160; \n\n(67 \n\n) \n\n(65 \n\n) \n\n(62 \n\n) \n\nCompany pension expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany postretirement expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n(62 \n\n) \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\nAccounts receivable \n\n&#160; \n\n(133 \n\n) \n\n(205 \n\n) \n\n(189 \n\n) \n\nInventories \n\n&#160; \n\n(251 \n\n) \n\n(196 \n\n) \n\n(404 \n\n) \n\nAccounts payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(83 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct and other insurance receivables and claims \n\n&#160; \n\n(32 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(139 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,284 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,174 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2012, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $16 million compared to 2011. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. 3M was able to achieve this growth in operating cash flow despite contributing an additional $564 million in its pension and postretirement plans when compared to 2011. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased $312 million in 2012, compared to increases of $484 million in 2011. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the &#147;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#148; section. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2011, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $110 million compared to 2010. The main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. Two primary items reduced operating cash flows. First, 3M invested in working capital in support of its growth. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and account payable increased $484 million in 2011, compared to increases of $447 million in 2010, with higher fourth-quarter 2011 sales compared to fourth-quarter 2010 sales contributing to this increase. Second, &#147;Other-net&#148; decreased cash flows by $139 million in 2011 compared to an increase of $279 million in 2010. The category, &#147;Other-net,&#148; in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, such as a decrease in accrued payroll amounts in 2011 related to certain annual incentives, which reduced liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure): \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. Below find a recap of free cash flow for 2012, 2011 and 2010. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,300 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,284 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,174 \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,484 \n\n) \n\n(1,379 \n\n) \n\n(1,091 \n\n) \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,816 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,905 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,083 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,484 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,379 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(1,091 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from sale of PP&#38;E and other assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,046 \n\n) \n\n(649 \n\n) \n\n(1,830 \n\n) \n\nPurchases and proceeds from sale or maturities of marketable securities and investments, net \n\n&#160; \n\n(211 \n\n) \n\n(745 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,686 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,718 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,626 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending was $1.484 billion in 2012, compared to $1.379 billion in 2011 and $1.091 billion in 2010. The Company expects 2013 capital spending to be approximately $1.6 to $1.8 billion, as 3M continues to invest in its businesses. In 2012, 3M expanded manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, particularly with respect to international and emerging market countries. This included investments in China, Turkey and Poland, in addition to investments in Singapore and the U.S. 3M also increased investments in IT systems and infrastructure and made strategic investments in research/development infrastructure and manufacturing sites to lay the foundation for future growth. In 2011, a large portion of the capital investment was used to address supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. In addition, some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. In 2010, in the U.S., 3M invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non-optical businesses which use similar technology. Also, in 2010, 3M increased capacity at its multi-purpose manufacturing facility in Singapore and invested in optical film capacity in Korea. Lastly, in 2010, investments in the Industrial and Transportation business included solar energy in the U.S. and industrial adhesives and tapes in China. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. The coupon interest rates for asset-backed securities are either fixed rate or floating. Floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly LIBOR rate. Each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective LIBOR rate +/- an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. Terms of the reset are unique to individual securities. Fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond. The spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. Refer to Note 8 for more details about 3M&#146;s diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $2.810 billion as of December 31, 2012. Additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in short-term debt &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(24 \n\n) \n\nRepayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) \n\n&#160; \n\n(612 \n\n) \n\n(1,429 \n\n) \n\n(556 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) \n\n&#160; \n\n1,370 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,111 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal cash change in debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(307 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(472 \n\n) \n\nPurchases of treasury stock \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,204 \n\n) \n\n(2,701 \n\n) \n\n(854 \n\n) \n\nProceeds from issuances of treasury stock pursuant to stock option and benefit plans \n\n&#160; \n\n1,012 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDividends paid to stockholders \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,635 \n\n) \n\n(1,555 \n\n) \n\n(1,500 \n\n) \n\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther &#151; net \n\n&#160; \n\n(15 \n\n) \n\n(67 \n\n) \n\n(77 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,058 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(3,675 \n\n) \n\n$ \n\n(2,184 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nTotal debt at December 31, 2012 was $6.0 billion, compared to $5.2 billion at year-end 2011 and $5.5 billion at year-end 2010. Total debt was 25 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2012, repayment of debt included $500 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes and repayment of debt acquired, primarily Ceradyne, Inc. Proceeds from debt in 2012 related to the June 2012 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2017 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of ten-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2022, in addition to 66 million GBP (approximately $106 million) in UK borrowings (refer to Note 9 for further detail on these items). In 2011, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included redemption of $800 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes in November 2011, redemption of Convertible Notes, repayment of debt related to the 11.6 billion Japanese Yen note (installments paid in March and September 2011), repayment of the remainder of the Canadian Dollar loan, and repayment of a portion of debt that was acquired, primarily related to the Winterthur acquisition. In 2011, proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) primarily related to the issuance of a $1 billion medium term note and an amendment to a Canada loan agreement which increased the principal amount of the loan by 100.5 million Canadian Dollars. In 2010, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included repayment of $350 million in Dealer Remarketable Securities, which matured in December 2010, and repayment of a portion of debt related to the 5.8 billion Japanese Yen installment paid on September 30, 2010. In addition, approximately $105 million in acquired debt related to 2010 acquisitions was subsequently repaid. In 2010, proceeds from debt primarily include a 100.5 million Canadian Dollar loan. \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company&#146;s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2013, 3M&#146;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of 3M&#146;s outstanding common stock, replacing the Company&#146;s existing repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. The Company purchased $2.204 billion in shares in 2012, $2.701 billion in shares in 2011, and $854 million in shares in 2010. For more information, refer to the table titled &#147;Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148; in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company&#146;s stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $1.635 billion ($2.36 per share) in 2012, $1.555 billion ($2.20 per share) in 2011 and $1.500 billion ($2.10 per share) in 2010. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2013, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3M common stock by 7.6 percent to 63.5 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.54 per share. This marked the 55th consecutive year of dividend increases. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to the items described below, other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2011, as discussed in Note 5, subsequent to acquiring a controlling interest in Winterthur, 3M purchased additional outstanding shares of its Winterthur subsidiary for $57 million, increasing 3M&#146;s ownership interest from approximately 86 percent to 100 percent as of December 31, 2011. These additional purchases are reflected as other financing activities in the statement of cash flows. In addition, during 2011, 3M sold a noncontrolling interest in a newly formed subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2010, as discussed in Note 5, the Company&#146;s majority owned Sumitomo 3M Limited entity (Sumitomo 3M) purchased a portion of its shares held by its noncontrolling interest, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI), by paying cash of 5.8 billion Japanese Yen and entering into a note payable to SEI of 17.4 billion \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nJapanese Yen (approximately $63 million and $188 million, respectively, based on applicable exchange rates at that time). The cash paid of approximately $63 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 as a result of the purchase of Sumitomo 3M shares from SEI is classified as &#147;Other financing activities&#148; in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The remainder of the purchase financed by the note payable to SEI is considered non-cash financing activity in the first quarter of 2010. As discussed in Note 2, during the second quarter of 2010, 3M recorded a financed liability of 1.7 billion Japanese yen (approximately $18 million based on applicable exchange rates at that time) related to the A-One acquisition, which is also considered a non-cash financing activity. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2012, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled &#147;Warranties/Guarantees&#148; in Note 13 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M&#146;s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of the Company&#146;s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments due by year \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt, including current portion (Note 9) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,902 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,481 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,686 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest on long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n1,721 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,108 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases (Note 13) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital leases (Note 13) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations and other \n\n&#160; \n\n1,489 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,060 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal contractual cash obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,943 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,451 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,021 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,222 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,975 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nLong-term debt payments due in 2013 and 2014 include floating rate notes totaling $132 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt) and $97 million, respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company&#146;s expected capital spending in 2013 and beyond. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M&#146;s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled &#147;Unconditional purchase obligations and other,&#148; include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $170 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 7 for further details. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 10, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2013 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Item 7A, &#147;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#148;, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n"}
