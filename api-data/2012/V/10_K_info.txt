The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. \n\nOverview \n\nVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. \n\nOverall economic conditions. &#32;Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2013 reflects the impacts of a slow-moving global economic recovery. \n\nInterchange multidistrict litigation. On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. The court entered the preliminary approval order of the settlement agreement on November 27, 2012. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Until the settlement agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that Visa will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs&#8217; claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the interchange multidistrict litigation for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we paid $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the individual merchants on October 29, 2012, and on November 6, 2012, the court entered an order dismissing the individual merchants' claims with prejudice. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nReduction in as-converted shares. &#32;During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased 33 million &#32;shares of our class A common stock using $5.4 billion &#32;of cash on hand. In July 2013, our board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2014. As of September 30, 2013, the July program had remaining authorized funds of $251 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2013 have been completed. In October 2013 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion &#32;share repurchase program. \n\nAdjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the prior or future years, as they either are non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nReversal of tax reserves. &#32;During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This increased our net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLitigation provision. During fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion &#32;and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END &#32;31 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDeferred tax adjustment. During fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevaluation of Visa Europe put option. &#32;During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision. \n\n##TABLE_END The following tables present our adjusted financial results for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal 2013 \n\n(in millions, except for percentages and per share data) \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Visa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (2) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n4,539 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,980 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.59 \n\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding \n\n(as reported) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal 2012 \n\n(in millions, except for percentages and per share data) \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Visa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (2) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n8,282 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,144 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.16 \n\nReversal of tax reserves \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(326 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.48 \n\n) \n\nLitigation provision \n\n(4,098 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2,593 \n\n(3 &#160; \n\n) &#160; \n\n3.82 \n\nImpact of deferred tax adjustment \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(208 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.31 \n\n) \n\nAdjusted \n\n$ \n\n4,184 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,203 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6.20 \n\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding \n\n(as reported) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal 2011 \n\n(in millions, except for percentages and per share data) \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Visa Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (2) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n3,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,650 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.16 \n\nRevaluation of Visa Europe put option \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(122 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.17 \n\n) \n\nAdjusted \n\n$ \n\n3,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,528 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.99 \n\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding \n\n(as reported) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nOperating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total operating revenues. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. \n\n##TABLE_END Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume grew in all categories worldwide except U.S. consumer debit, which has been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nIncludes prepaid volume. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nTotal nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on Visa-branded cards and payment products. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. \n\n##TABLE_END The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented.

We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. \n\nThe following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: \n\nService revenues &#32;consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. \n\nData processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our financial institution clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform . Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. \n\nInternational transaction revenues &#32;are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. \n\nOther revenues &#32;consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, licensing and certification, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. &#32; \n\nClient incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nPersonnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. \n\nNetwork and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. \n\n&#32;34 \n\nMarketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. \n\nProfessional fees &#32;mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. \n\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. \n\nGeneral and administrative &#32;mainly consists of travel activities, facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. \n\nLitigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. \n\nNon-operating Income \n\nNon-operating income mainly includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions; income, gains and losses earned on investments; and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. \n\nVisa Inc. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nThe following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2&#8212;Visa Europe &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nUnited States \n\n$ \n\n6,379 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,720 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,135 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nInternational \n\n5,177 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,478 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,846 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nVisa Europe \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal Operating Revenues \n\n$ \n\n11,778 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,357 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. \n\n##TABLE_END The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. Operating revenue growth also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the United States during the second half of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. \n\nOur operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2013, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about one percentage point in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2012. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2014 , a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2014, net of offsetting hedges. See Note 12&#8212;Derivative Financial Instruments &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#32;35 \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues. ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nService revenues \n\n$ \n\n5,352 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,872 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,261 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nData processing revenues \n\n4,642 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,975 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,478 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nInternational transaction revenues \n\n3,389 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,025 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,674 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nOther revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nClient incentives \n\n(2,321 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,155 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,880 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(166 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(275 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nTotal Operating Revenues \n\n$ \n\n11,778 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,188 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,357 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,233 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The growth in service revenues in fiscal 2012 &#32;was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume due to a shift in the mix of our payments volume, primarily in volume related to Interlink, which is a debit product that does not generate any service revenues. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nData processing revenues &#32;increased in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10% &#32;and 5% , respectively, combined with pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 &#32;as part of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInternational transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;primarily reflecting 10% &#32;and 11% &#32;growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther revenues &#32;increased in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nClient incentives &#32;increased in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 , reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. These included a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as issuer contracts executed in fiscal 2013. Additionally, client incentives increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume. Activity in fiscal 2012 also reflects certain one-time incentives incurred outside the United States. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% for the full 2014 fiscal year. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#32;36 \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year ended \n\nSeptember 30, \n\n&#160; \n\n$ Change \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\nvs. \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except percentages) \n\nPersonnel \n\n$ \n\n1,932 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,726 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,459 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMarketing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n% \n\nNetwork and processing \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nProfessional fees \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nLitigation provision \n\n&#160; \n\n4,100 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,097 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n4,093 \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\nTotal Operating Expenses (2) \n\n$ \n\n4,539 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,282 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(3,743 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,550 \n\n&#160; \n\n(45 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\nNM \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The increase in fiscal 2012 &#32;is primarily due to increases in headcount, and reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMarketing remained relatively flat in fiscal 2013 &#32;and fiscal 2012 &#32;when compared to the respective prior year. Fiscal 2013 &#32;activity mainly reflected strategies to promote our core products, combined with a number of various campaigns, including the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Marketing in fiscal 2012 &#32;mainly reflected sponsorship of the 2012 London Summer Olympics, as well as spend in support of our new product initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nNetwork and processing &#32;in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 &#32;increased mainly due to costs incurred for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProfessional fees increased in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 , primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDepreciation and amortization &#32;increased in fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012 , primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGeneral and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 after experiencing an increase in fiscal 2012 &#32;mainly due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLitigation provision in &#32; fiscal &#32; 2012 &#32;reflects a $4.1 billion &#32;accrual related to the covered litigation. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END Non-operating Income \n\nNon-operating income in fiscal 2013 &#32;of $18 million &#32;decreased from $68 million &#32;in fiscal 2012 &#32;primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012 &#32;of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. See Note 19&#8212;Income Taxes &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; \n\n&#32;37 \n\nto our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in fiscal 2012 &#32;from $200 million &#32;in fiscal 2011 &#32;was primarily due to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe absence of a $122 million non-cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe absence of a pre-tax gain of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Solu&#231;&#245;es e Servi&#231;os, or CBSS; offset by \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe reversal of previously accrued interest expense discussed above. \n\n##TABLE_END Effective Income Tax Rate \n\nThe effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 &#32;differs from the effective income tax rates of 3% and 36% in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, mainly due to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe decrease in overall ongoing state tax rate beginning in fiscal 2012 as a result of changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 &#32;as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ncertain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe absence of the following in fiscal 2013 : \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe fiscal 2012 &#32;reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na fiscal 2012 &#32;one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 &#32;tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 &#32;pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion &#32;covered litigation provision; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011 . \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nAdjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 . Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in that or future years, as they were either non-recurring, had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2012 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective Income Tax Rate \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions, except for percentages) \n\nAs reported \n\n$ \n\n2,207 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nReversal of tax reserves \n\n(43 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLitigation provision \n\n4,098 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,505 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRemeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAdjusted \n\n$ \n\n6,262 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,061 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nManagement of Our Liquidity \n\nWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. \n\nThe objectives of our treasury policies are to: \n\n&#32;38 \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprovide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nensure payments on required litigation settlements; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nmake planned capital investments in our business; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\npay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\noptimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. \n\nCash Flow Data \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nTotal cash provided by (used in): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n$ \n\n3,022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,009 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,872 \n\nInvesting activities \n\n(1,164 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,414 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,299 \n\n) \n\nFinancing activities \n\n(1,746 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,655 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,304 \n\n) \n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(53 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,740 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was lower during fiscal 2013 &#32;compared to prior year, reflecting payments from the litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion &#32;in connection with the covered litigation. As these payments were made from our litigation escrow account, they were also reflected as cash inflows under financing activities. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. The tax deduction related to these payments contributed to the $1.5 billion &#32;decline in overall income taxes paid during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year. Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities would have totaled $5.9 billion , an increase over fiscal 2012, reflecting continued growth in operating revenues. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting higher operating revenues in fiscal 2012. \n\nInvesting activities. &#32;Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. See Note 4&#8212;Fair Value Measurements and Investments &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was relatively consistent, reflecting our continued investment in available-for-sale securities. \n\nFinancing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as-converted class A share count, either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow, and increased dividends. Cash used in financing activities also reflects cash inflows relating to payments made in connection with the covered litigation from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan , Note 14&#8212;Stockholders' Equity &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nSources of Liquidity \n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, our access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. \n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $4.3 billion &#32;at September 30, 2013 . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use \n\n&#32;39 \n\nin the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries, which we estimate to be approximately $3.8 billion . It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in the United States. \n\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $2.8 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. \n\nFactors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors &#32;included elsewhere in this report. \n\nCommercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. On February 7, 2013 , we replaced the existing $500 million &#32;program with a new commercial paper program. Under the new program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion &#32;in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 &#32;days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the new program at September 30, 2013 . See Note 9&#8212;Debt &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nCredit facility. On January 31, 2013 , we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion &#32;revolving credit facility. This credit facility, which expires on January 30, 2014, replaced our existing $3.0 billion &#32;credit facility, which would have expired on February 15, 2013 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under the new credit facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants at September 30, 2013 . See Note 9&#8212;Debt &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nUniversal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2015. \n\nLitigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2013 , was $49 million &#32;and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nAt September 30, 2013 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nStandard and Poor&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s \n\nDebt type \n\nRating \n\n&#160; \n\nOutlook \n\n&#160; \n\nRating \n\n&#160; \n\nOutlook \n\nShort-term unsecured debt \n\nA-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n&#160; \n\nP-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\nLong-term unsecured debt \n\nA+ \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n&#160; \n\nA1 \n\n&#160; \n\nStable \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. \n\n&#32;40 \n\nUses of Liquidity \n\nPayments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2013 , however, we were only required to fund settlement-related working capital on a few days, including a peak net settlement receivable balance of $36 million. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $198 million. \n\nCovered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2013 , we made $4.4 billion &#32;in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, of which, $4.0 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the settlement agreement, if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement, defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of no more than 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out. See Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. Upon final court approval of the settlement agreement, Visa's portion of the takedown payments, calculated to be $1.1 billion , will increase our current taxable income. The resulting increase in our current taxable income will increase our deferred tax asset and income tax payable by $387 million, which will have a negative impact on our free cash flow in the year the final court approval is rendered. See Note 19&#8212;Income Taxes &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2013 , the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $49 million . See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOther litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. \n\nReduction in as-converted shares. &#32;During fiscal 2013 , we repurchased 33 million &#32;shares of our class A common stock using $5.4 billion &#32;of operating cash on hand. At September 30, 2013, we had $251 million &#32;of remaining funds available for share repurchases under the current program authorized by the board of directors. In October 2013 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion &#32;share repurchase program. See Note 14&#8212;Stockholders' Equity &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nDividends . During fiscal 2013 , we paid $864 million &#32;in dividends. In October 2013 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.40 &#32;per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $255 million &#32;in connection with this dividend on December 3, 2013 . See Note 14&#8212;Stockholders' Equity &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Classes of B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. \n\nVisa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the \"P/E ratio\" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the \"adjusted sustainable income\" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. \n\n&#32;The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2013 , we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million . While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may \n\n&#32;41 \n\nneed to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. \n\nGiven the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2013 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2013 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9 x. At September 30, 2013 , the spot P/E ratio was 21.5 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nVisa Inc&#8217;s Forward \n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio \n\n&#160; \n\nPayout Assuming \n\nAdjusted Sustainable \n\nIncome of $100 million (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/Decrease in Payout \n\nfor Each $25 million of \n\nAdjusted Sustainable \n\nIncome Above/Below $100 million \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$2,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$625 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$2,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n$500 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$1,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$375 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nGiven the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. \n\n##TABLE_END Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million , $88 million, and $74 million, respectively. The lower contribution in fiscal 2013 was driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at September 30, 2013 compared to September 30, 2012. In fiscal 2014 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $12 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10&#8212;Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nCapital expenditures. &#32;Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2013 &#32;due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. \n\nAcquisitions. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2012, compared to fiscal 2011, when we acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. \n\n&#32;42 \n\nFair Value Measurements&#8212;Financial Instruments \n\nThe assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2013 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.0 billion &#32;of assets and $160 million &#32;of liabilities. Of these instruments, $152 million , or 2% , had significant unobservable inputs, including the Visa Europe put option liability of $145 million , and $7 million &#32;of auction rate securities. See Note 4&#8212;Fair Value Measurements and Investments &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. \n\nIndemnifications \n\nWe indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other clients to honor Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See &#32; Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32; and &#32; Note 11&#8212;Settlement Guarantee Management &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2013. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\nPayments Due by Period \n\n&#160; \n\nLess than \n\n1 Year \n\n&#160; \n\n1-3 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\n3-5 \n\nYears \n\n&#160; \n\nMore than \n\n5 Years \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nPurchase orders (1) \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,187 \n\nLeases (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nClient incentives (3) \n\n2,835 \n\n&#160; \n\n3,969 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,406 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,705 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,915 \n\nMarketing and sponsorship (4) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDividends (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal (6,7,8) \n\n$ \n\n4,228 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,480 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,621 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,965 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,294 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; \n\nRepresents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) &#160; \n\nIncludes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) &#160; \n\nRepresents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to \n\n##TABLE_END &#32;43 \n\nexisting contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies &#32;to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. \n\n##TABLE_START (4) &#160; \n\nVisa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) &#160; \n\nIncludes expected dividend amount of $255 million &#32;as dividends were declared in October 2013 &#32;and will be paid on December 3, 2013 &#32;to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 15, 2013 . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) &#160; \n\nWe have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $453 million. At September 30, 2013, we also accrued $29 million &#32;of interest and $3 million &#32;of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) &#160; \n\nVisa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million &#32;at September 30, 2013 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources &#32;and Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;and Note 2&#8212;Visa Europe &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (8) &#160; \n\nWe evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10&#8212;Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits &#32; to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources s ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n##TABLE_END Critical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. \n\nWe believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. \n\nRevenue Recognition &#8212; Client Incentives \n\nCritical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued \n\n&#32;44 \n\nsystematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2013 , client incentives represented 16% &#32;of gross operating revenues. \n\nFair Value &#8212; Visa Europe Put Option \n\nCritical estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. \n\nUpon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2&#8212;Visa Europe &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. \n\nThe fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million &#32;at September 30, 2013 . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. \n\nWhile this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;for further discussion. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. \n\nProbability of exercise&#8212; Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. \n\n&#32;45 \n\nP/E differential&#8212; The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the &#8220;long-term P/E calculation&#8221;) and the last 30 trading dates (the &#8220;30-day P/E calculation&#8221;) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. \n\nFactors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. \n\nOther estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013 , we have assumed a 40% &#32;probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% &#32;higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million &#32;in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million &#32;in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2013 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Matters \n\nCritical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. \n\n&#32;46 \n\nOur retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2013. See Note 3&#8212;Retrospective Responsibility Plan &#32;and Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters &#32; to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nCritical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. \n\nAssumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. \n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_START "}
