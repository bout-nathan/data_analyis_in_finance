Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW \n\nGeneral \n\nUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making health care work better. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. Further information on our business is included in Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221; and additional information on the our segments can be found in this Item 7 and in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nRevenues \n\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers&#8217; health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees&#8217; dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from our Optum businesses relating to care management, consumer engagement and support, distribution of benefits and services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy services. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities; investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. \n\nPricing Trends . We seek to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, competitive dynamics, cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of Health Reform Legislation and premium rebates at the local market level. We endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business. Changes in business mix and Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. Further, we continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure through continued market competition in commercial products and government payment rates. Aggregating UnitedHealthcare&#8217;s businesses, we expect the medical care ratio to rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the health benefit exchange market in 2014. \n\nIn the commercial market segment, we expect pricing to continue to be highly competitive in 2013. We plan to hold to our pricing disciplines and, considering the competitive environment and persistently weak employment and new business formation rates, we expect continued pressure on our commercial risk-based product membership in 2013. Additionally, self-insured membership as a percent of total commercial membership is expected to continue to increase at a modest pace in 2013 and beyond, due in part to the emerging popularity of midsize employers moving to self-funded arrangements. \n\nIn government programs, we are seeing continuing rate pressures, and rate changes for some Medicaid programs are slightly negative. Unlike in prior years, recent Medicaid reductions have generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or care provider fee schedule reductions by the state sponsor. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing Medicaid contracts. Medicare funding is similarly pressured; see further discussion below in &#8220;Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.&#8221; We expect these factors to result in pressure on gross margin percentages for our Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2013. \n\nIn 2013, UnitedHealthcare created a new affordable &#8220;Basic Plan&#8221; for Medicare Part D consumers and reclassified its large 4 million member Medicare Part D plan to an &#8220;Enhanced Plan&#8221; status with CMS. The change to Enhanced Plan status changes the seasonal pattern of earnings to later in the year with no material impact expected on full year profitability. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nMedical Costs. &#32;Medical costs represent the costs of our obligations for claims and/or benefits of our risk-based insurance arrangements. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. \n\nMedical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. \n\nOur medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, rebates, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. \n\nMedical Cost Trends. In 2012, we managed our commercial medical cost trend to a level under 5.5 percent. In 2013, we expect a slight increase in trend from 2012, albeit with relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2012. We expect our total trend will be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers as they try to compensate for soft utilization trends and cross-subsidization pressure due to their government reimbursement levels. \n\nUnderlying utilization trends declined significantly in 2010 and increased modestly in 2011 and 2012. Use of outpatient services has been the primary driver of utilization trend increase, with inpatient utilization declining. We also experienced an increase in prescription drug costs in 2012 and expect that trend to continue due to unit cost pressure and a trend towards expensive new specialty drugs. As we move into 2013, we believe current utilization trends are slightly below what we believe to be normal utilization levels. The weak economic environment, combined with our medical cost management, has had a favorable impact on utilization trends. We believe our alignment of progressive benefit designs, consumer engagement, clinical management, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers and network resources is favorably controlling medical and pharmacy costs, enhancing affordability and quality for our customers and members and helping to drive strong market response and growth. \n\nOperating Costs. &#32;Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses or an increase in the delivery of medical services on an integrated basis may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. \n\nOther Business Trends \n\nOur businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other health economies. In the U.S., health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including in the U.S. enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. \n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. These factors are creating market pressures to change from fee-for-service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer, integrated care across care providers and pay-for-performance payment structures. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve the overall care for people, improve the health of a population and reduce the cost of care. The focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. We have seen increased participation in incentive-based payment models such as pay for performance, shared savings, bundled/episode payment and Patient-Centered Medical Home models (PCMHs). We also have seen continued development and deployment of risk-based accountable care models designed to modernize local delivery systems by better coordinating care, reducing the fragmentation of treatments between multiple care providers in the current system, limiting unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions, focusing on preventive care, breaking down reimbursement and treatment &#8220;silos,&#8221; and improving quality and outcomes. \n\nThis trend is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, providing growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. \n\nGovernment Reliance on Private Sector. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions. We expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible, better managed, higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs. \n\nStates are struggling to balance unprecedented budget pressures with increases in their Medicaid expenditures. At the same time, many are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs. More and more, Medicaid managed care is being viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs. Additionally, there are more than nine million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Dually eligible beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. While these individuals&#8217; health needs are more complex and more costly, they have historically been in unmanaged environments. This provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid financing to fund efforts to optimize the health status of this frail population through close coordination of care. As of December 31, 2012, UnitedHealthcare served more than 250,000 members in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State will help implement Ohio&#8217;s MME program, one of the first in the country under the new CMS design. \n\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties \n\nFollowing is a summary of management&#8217;s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items; for additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation and Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties, see Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Regulation&#8221; and Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nCommercial Rate Increase Review. &#32;The Health Reform Legislation requires HHS to maintain an annual review of &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% and clarified that HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval procedures. Premium rate review legislation (ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements) has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states as of the date of this report. \n\nThe competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience a tight, competitive commercial pricing environment. Further, our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practices. We anticipate requesting rate increases above 10% in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform. We have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. Depending on the level of scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression in the commercial health benefits business. \n\nMedicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. &#32;Medicare Advantage pricing benchmarks have been cut over the last several years and additional cuts were implemented in 2012, with changes to continue to be phased in over the next one to five years (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. Additionally, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, would trigger automatic across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration), including a reduction in outlays for Medicare starting in March 2013, absent further Congressional action. Further, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage plans will be required to have a minimum medical loss ratio of 85%. CMS has not yet issued guidance as to how this requirement will be calculated for Medicare Advantage plans. \n\nA significant portion of our network contracts are tied to Medicare reimbursement levels. However, future Medicare Advantage rates may be outpaced by underlying medical cost trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. There are a number of annual adjustments we can and are making to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, adjust members&#8217; benefits and decide on a county-by-county basis in which geographies to participate. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions. The expanded stars bonus program is set to expire in 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans per PPACA (compared to current bonuses that are available to certain qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher). Approximately 60% and 10% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and 4 stars or \n\nhigher, respectively for the 2014 payment year based on scoring released by CMS in October 2012. Updated scores, to be released in October 2013, will determine what portion of our Medicare Advantage membership will reside in a 4 star or 5 star plan and qualify for quality bonus payments in 2015. Although we are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings, if we are unable to significantly increase the level of membership in plans with a rating of 4 stars or higher for the 2015 payment year, our 2015 results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. \n\nWe also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Compared to 2011, our 2012 Medicare Advantage membership has increased by 400,000 &#32;consumers, or 18% , including acquisitions. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance offerings. \n\nIndustry Fees and Taxes. &#32;The Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, non-deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based products, beginning January 1, 2014. The amount of the annual tax is $8 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will be equal to the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual tax will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity&#8217;s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry&#8217;s net premiums written for any U.S. health risk-based products during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. This tax will first be paid and expensed in 2014; however, because our policies are annual, we have included the tax and other Health Reform Legislation cost factors in our 2013 rate filings relating to 2014 rate periods and any related premium increases for 2013 policies that have coverage into 2014 will increase the amount of premium recognized in 2013. Our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 as a result of the non-deductibility of these taxes. \n\nWith the introduction of state health insurance exchanges in 2014, the Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs are: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program which will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements ($25 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2014 of which $20 billion (subject to increases based on state decisions) will fund the state reinsurance pools and $5 billion funds the U.S. Treasury). The terms of the specific reinsurance programs to be used in each state are not yet known. \n\nIt is our intention to pass these taxes and fees on to customers through increases in rates and/or decreases in benefits, subject to regulatory approval. \n\nState-Based Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. &#32;Effective in 2014, state-based exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes scheduled to commence in October of 2013. We expect to selectively respond and participate in exchanges as they are introduced to the market. Our level of participation in state-based exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local market&#8217;s current and future prospects, including how the exchange and its rules are set up state-by-state and, our market position relative to others in the market. Our participation will likely evolve and change over time as the exchange markets mature. Exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market, its pace and its impact on our established membership. For example, certain small employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and larger employers may elect to convert their benefit plans from risk-based to self-funded programs. \n\nThe Health Reform Legislation also provides for expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. These measures remain subject to implementation at the state level. \n\nIndividual &#38; Small Group Market Reforms. &#32;The Health Reform Legislation includes several provisions that will take effect on January 1, 2014 and are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace. Although HHS issued proposed regulations in late 2012, these regulations are not yet final. Key provisions include: (1) adjusted community rating requirements, which will change how individual and small group plans are rated in many states and are expected to result in significant adjustments in some policyholders&#8217; rates during the transition period; (2) essential health benefit requirements, which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders and will also impact rates; and (3) actuarial value requirements, which will significantly impact benefit designs (e.g. member cost sharing requirements) and could also significantly impact rates for some policyholders. \n\nRESULTS SUMMARY \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \n\nIncrease/(Decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(Decrease) \n\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 vs. 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 vs. 2010 \n\nRevenues: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPremiums \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n99,728 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n91,983 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n85,405 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,578 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nServices \n\n&#160; \n\n7,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n6,613 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,819 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProducts \n\n&#160; \n\n2,773 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,612 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,322 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment and other income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n110,618 \n\n&#160; \n\n101,862 \n\n&#160; \n\n94,155 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,756 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,707 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating costs: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMedical costs \n\n&#160; \n\n80,226 \n\n&#160; \n\n74,332 \n\n&#160; \n\n68,841 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,894 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,491 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating costs \n\n&#160; \n\n17,306 \n\n&#160; \n\n15,557 \n\n&#160; \n\n14,270 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,749 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,287 \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of products sold \n\n&#160; \n\n2,523 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,385 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,116 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n1,309 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,124 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,064 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal operating costs \n\n&#160; \n\n101,364 \n\n&#160; \n\n93,398 \n\n&#160; \n\n86,291 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,966 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,107 \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings from operations \n\n&#160; \n\n9,254 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,464 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,864 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n(632 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(505 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(481 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n8,622 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,959 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,383 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,096 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,817 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,749 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet earnings \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,526 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,142 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,634 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.28 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.10 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.55 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.63 \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\nMedical care ratio (a) \n\n&#160; \n\n80.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n80.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n80.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating cost ratio \n\n&#160; \n\n15.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n15.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n15.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating margin \n\n&#160; \n\n8.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n8.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n35.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n35.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n37.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet margin \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n4.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nReturn on equity (b) \n\n&#160; \n\n18.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n18.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n18.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32; \n\n##TABLE_START (a) \n\nMedical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) \n\nReturn on equity is calculated as net earnings divided by average equity.

We also plan to acquire an additional 25% of Amil in the first half of 2013. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for further detail on Amil. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWe repurchased 57 million shares for $3.1 billion and paid dividends of $0.8 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END 2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTS \n\nC onsolidated Financial Results \n\nRevenues \n\nRevenue increases in 2012 &#32;were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our UnitedHealthcare businesses and growth in our Optum health service and technology offerings. \n\nMedical Costs \n\nMedical costs increased in 2012 &#32;due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses, unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use, partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development. Unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nThe increases in our operating costs for 2012 &#32;were due to business growth, including increases in revenues from UnitedHealthcare fee-based benefits and Optum services, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, as well as investments in the OptumRx pharmacy management services and UnitedHealthcare Military &#38; Veterans businesses. \n\nIncome Tax Rate \n\nThe increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 &#32;was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011, which lowered the 2011 &#32;effective income tax rate. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State, and UnitedHealthcare International; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumHealth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumInsight; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumRx. \n\n##TABLE_END See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; and Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221; for a description of how each of our reportable segments derives its revenues. \n\nTransactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management&#8217;s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. \n\nThe following table presents reportable segment financial information: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \n\n&#160;

In fee-based commercial products, the increase was due to a number of new business awards and strong customer retention. Medicare Advantage increased due to strengthened execution in product design, marketing and local engagement, which drove sales growth, combined with the addition of 185,000 Medicare Advantage members from 2012 acquisitions. Medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers, partially offset by a fourth quarter market withdrawal from one product in a specific region, affecting 175,000 beneficiaries. Medicare Supplement growth was due to strong retention and new sales. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, membership decreased primarily as a result of the first quarter 2012 loss of approximately 470,000 auto-assigned low-income subsidy Medicare Part D beneficiaries, due to pricing benchmarks for the government-subsidized low income Medicare Part D market coming in below our bids in a number of regions. International represents commercial membership in Brazil added as a result of the Amil acquisition in 2012. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s revenue growth in 2012 &#32;was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served, commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s earnings from operations for 2012 &#32;increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development. The favorable development for 2012 &#32;was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing. \n\nIn March 2012, UnitedHealthcare Military &#38; Veterans was awarded the TRICARE West Region Managed Care Support Contract. The contract, for health care operations, includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the government&#8217;s option. The first year of operations is anticipated to begin April 1, 2013. The base administrative services contract is expected to generate a total of $1.4 billion in revenues over the five years. \n\nOptum. &#32;Total revenues increased in 2012 &#32;due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at OptumHealth, partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of UnitedHealthcare Part D prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes. \n\nOptum&#8217;s earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 &#32;increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification, integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products. \n\nThe results by segment were as follows: \n\nOptumHealth \n\nRevenue increases at OptumHealth for 2012 &#32;were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery, and strong overall business growth. \n\nEarnings from operations for 2012 &#32;and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations. \n\nOptumInsight \n\nRevenues at OptumInsight for 2012 &#32;increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers, which was partially offset by the June 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business. \n\nThe increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 &#32;reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management. \n\nOptumRx \n\nThe decreases in OptumRx revenues in 2012 &#32;were due to the reduction in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D plan participants. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $15.6 billion &#32;for 2012 &#32;and $16.7 billion &#32;for 2011 . \n\nOptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 &#32;decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the Medicare Part D business and investments to support growth initiatives, which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications. \n\nOver the course of 2013, we will consolidate and manage our commercial pharmacy benefit programs from Express Scripts&#8217; subsidiary, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. As a result of this transition, OptumRx expects to add approximately12 million members throughout 2013. \n\n2011 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2010 RESULTS \n\nConsolidated Financial Results \n\nRevenues \n\nThe increases in revenues for 2011 &#32;were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our UnitedHealthcare businesses, commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all Optum businesses. \n\nMedical Costs \n\nMedical costs for 2011 &#32;increased due to risk-based membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use, and a modest increase in health system utilization, mainly in outpatient and physician office settings. \n\nFor each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2011 &#32;and 2010 &#32;there was $720 million &#32;and $800 million , respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels. The favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nThe increase in our operating costs for 2011 &#32;was due to business growth, including an increased mix of Optum and UnitedHealthcare fee-based and service revenues, which have higher operating costs, and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance. These factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. \n\nIncome Tax Rate \n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2011 &#32;decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010, due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the Health Reform Legislation. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nUnitedHealthcare \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s revenue growth for 2011 &#32;was due to growth in the number of individuals served across our businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting expected underlying medical cost trends. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s earnings from operations for 2011 &#32;increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio, which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in 2011, and lower favorable reserve development levels. \n\nOptum. &#32;Total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at OptumHealth and OptumInsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at OptumRx. \n\nOptum&#8217;s operating margin for 2011 &#32;was down compared to 2010. The decrease was due to changes in business mix within Optum&#8217;s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements. \n\nThe results by segment were as follows: \n\nOptumHealth \n\nIncreased revenues at OptumHealth for 2011 &#32;were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services, as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings. \n\nEarnings from operations for 2011 &#32;and operating margin decreased compared to 2010. The decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services. \n\nOptumInsight \n\nIncreased revenues at OptumInsight for 2011 &#32;were due to the impact of organic growth and the full-year impact of 2010 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in June 2011. \n\nThe increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 &#32;reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. \n\nOptumRx \n\nThe increase in OptumRx revenues for 2011 &#32;was due to increased prescription volumes, primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement business, and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $16.7 billion &#32;and $14.4 billion &#32;for 2011 &#32;and 2010 , respectively. \n\nOptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 &#32;decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and Medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications. \n\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity \n\nIntroduction \n\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary&#8217;s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as &#8220;ordinary dividends&#8221; and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an &#8220;extraordinary dividend&#8221; and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2012, based on the 2011 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid by our U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.6 billion . \n\nIn 2012 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion , including $1.2 billion &#32;of extraordinary dividends. In 2011 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion , including $1.1 billion &#32;of extraordinary dividends. \n\nOur non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. \n\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(Decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease/(Decrease) \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2012 vs. 2011 \n\n&#160; \n\n2011 vs. 2010 \n\nSources of cash: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,155 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,968 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,273 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nProceeds from issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments \n\n&#160; \n\n4,567 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,221 \n\n&#160; \n\nProceeds from common stock issuances \n\n&#160; \n\n1,078 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet proceeds from customer funds administered \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(37 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(937 \n\n) \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(391 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sources of cash \n\n&#160; \n\n12,800 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,123 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,633 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUses of cash: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,280 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,459 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,304 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,821 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nCommon stock repurchases \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,084 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,994 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,517 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(90 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(477 \n\n) \n\nPurchases of investments, net of sales and maturities \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,299 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,695 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,157 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net of dispositions \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,070 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,018 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(878 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(52 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(140 \n\n) \n\nCash dividends paid \n\n&#160; \n\n(820 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(651 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(449 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(169 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(202 \n\n) \n\nNet cash paid for customer funds administered \n\n&#160; \n\n(324 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(324 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nAcquisition of noncontrolling interest shares \n\n&#160; \n\n(319 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(319 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n(627 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(627 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal uses of cash \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,823 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(7,817 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(8,310 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet (decrease) increase in cash \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,023 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(677 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,329 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n2012 Cash Flows Compared to 2011 Cash Flows \n\nCash flows from operating activities for 2012 &#32;increased $187 million , or 3% &#32;from 2011 due to increased net income and related tax accruals, which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year rebate payments were made under the Health Reform Legislation. \n\nCash flows used for investing activities increased $4.5 billion , or 107% , primarily due to increased investments in acquisitions in 2012. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for further information on 2012 acquisitions. \n\nCash flows from financing activities increased $3.0 billion &#32;primarily due to increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances, partially offset by increases in cash paid for customer funds related to Part D and increased shareholder dividend payments. The increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances were primarily related to the Amil acquisition. \n\n2011 Cash Flows Compared to 2010 Cash Flows \n\nCash flows from operating activities increased $695 million , or 11% , from 2010. The increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts, which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state Medicaid premium payments in 2010, which increased 2010 cash from operating activities. \n\nCash flows used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion , or 22% , primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments. \n\nCash flows used for financing activities increased $879 million , or 55% , primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings. \n\nFinancial Condition \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.3 billion &#32;included $8.4 billion &#32;of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.1 billion &#32;was held by non-regulated entities), $19.2 billion &#32;of debt securities and $677 million &#32;of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $241 million &#32;of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for further detail of our fair value measurements. \n\nOur cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2012 . Included in the debt securities balance was $1.9 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2012 . We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. \n\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity \n\nIn addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: \n\nCommercial Paper. &#32;We maintain a commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below. As of December 31, 2012 , we had $1.6 billion &#32;of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.3% . \n\nBank Credit Facilities . &#32;We have $3.0 billion &#32;five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 21 &#32;banks, which mature in November 2017 &#32;and November 2013, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for our $4.0 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2012 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2012 , the annual interest rates on these facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% &#32;to 1.3% . \n\nOur bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders&#8217; \n\nequity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 35.0% &#32;as of December 31, 2012 . We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2012 . \n\nLong-term debt. &#32;Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. \n\nIn connection with the Amil acquisition, we assumed variable rate debt denominated in Brazilian Reais, Amil&#8217;s functional currency. The total Brazilian Real denominated long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 was $611 million , and had an aggregate weighted average interest rate of approximately 9%. For more detail on the Amil debt see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nIn October 2012, we issued $2.5 billion &#32;in senior unsecured notes, which included: $625 million &#32;of 0.850% &#32;fixed-rate notes due October 2015 , $625 million &#32;of 1.400% &#32;fixed-rate notes due October 2017 , $625 million &#32;of 2.750% &#32;fixed-rate notes due February 2023 &#32;and $625 million &#32;of 3.950% &#32;fixed-rate notes due October 2042 . \n\nIn August 2012, we completed an exchange of $1.1 billion &#32;of our zero coupon senior unsecured notes due November 2022 for $0.5 billion &#32;additional issuance of our 2.875% &#32;notes due in March 2022 , $0.1 billion &#32;additional issuance of our 4.375% &#32;notes due March 2042 &#32;and $0.1 billion &#32;in cash. The transaction was undertaken to increase financial flexibility and reduce interest expense. \n\nIn March 2012 , we issued $1.0 billion &#32;in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $600 million &#32;of 2.875% &#32;fixed-rate notes due March 2022 &#32;and $400 million &#32;of 4.375% &#32;fixed-rate notes due March 2042 . \n\nCredit Ratings. &#32;Our credit ratings at December 31, 2012 &#32;were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nStandard &#38; Poor&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nFitch \n\n&#160; \n\nA.M.

For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. \n\nShare Repurchase Program. Under our Board of Directors&#8217; authorization, we maintain a share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2012 , our Board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million &#32;shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 85 million shares of our common stock. For details of our 2012 share repurchases, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nDividends. In June 2012 , our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.85 &#32;per share, paid quarterly. Since May 2011 , we had paid an annual dividend of $0.65 &#32;per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. For details of our dividend payments, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nAmil Tender Offer. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we purchased approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of Amil for $3.5 billion. We expect to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest during the first half of 2013 through a tender offer for Amil&#8217;s publicly traded shares. The tender offer price will be at the same price paid to Amil&#8217;s controlling shareholders, adjusted for statutory interest under Brazilian law from the date of payment to the controlling shareholders to the date of payment to the tendering minority shareholders. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2012 , under our various contractual obligations and commitments: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2014 to 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 to 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nDebt (a) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,413 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,271 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,384 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,769 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n26,837 \n\nOperating leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,122 \n\nPurchase obligations (b) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nFuture policy benefits (c) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,923 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,579 \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits (d) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,511 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,624 \n\nOther obligations (f) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests (g) \n\n&#160; \n\n1,393 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,121 \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,608 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,731 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,778 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,862 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,979 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (a) \n\nIncludes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. For variable rate debt, the rates in effect at December 31, 2012 were used to calculate the interest coupon payments. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements\" for more detail. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) \n\nIncludes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 . \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (c) \n\nFuture policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements\" for more detail. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) \n\nAs the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as &#8220;Thereafter.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) \n\nIncludes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as &#8220;Thereafter.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) \n\nIncludes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (g) \n\nIncludes commitments to purchase the remaining publicly traded Amil shares as well as the put/call for the shares owned by Amil's remaining non-public shareholders. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements\" for more detail. \n\n##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. \n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nAs of December 31, 2012, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nWe have determined that there have been no recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent \n\nperiods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nMedical Costs Payable \n\nEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2012, our days outstanding in medical payables was 49 days. \n\nEach period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 &#32;included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $860 million , $720 million &#32;and $800 million , respectively. \n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. \n\nCompletion Factors. &#32;Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2012 : \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Completion Factors \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nIn Medical Costs Payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n(0.75)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.50) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.25) \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25 \n\n&#160; \n\n(86 \n\n) \n\n0.50 \n\n&#160; \n\n(172 \n\n) \n\n0.75 \n\n&#160; \n\n(257 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMedical cost PMPM trend factors. &#32;Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a \n\nbroad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2012 : \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Medical Costs PMPM Trend \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nIn Medical Costs Payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n3% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2 \n\n&#160; \n\n1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(168 \n\n) \n\n(2) \n\n&#160; \n\n(337 \n\n) \n\n(3) \n\n&#160; \n\n(505 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \n\nOur estimate of medical costs payable represents management&#8217;s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2012 , developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2012 ; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2012 &#32;estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2012 &#32;net earnings would have increased or decreased by $62 million. \n\nRevenues \n\nRevenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. \n\nEffective in 2011, U.S. commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. \n\nOur Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS&#8217; risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS&#8217; retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information regarding these audits. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. \n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. \n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. \n\nForecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategy. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevenue trends. Key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions around unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMedical cost trends. See further discussion of medical costs trends within Medical Costs above. Similar factors are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCapital levels. The capital structure and requirements for each business is considered. \n\n##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Regulation&#8221;. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I and &#8220;Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties&#8221; above. \n\nDiscount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. \n\nThe passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units&#8217; operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. \n\nWe elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2013. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values, thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2012 . \n\nIntangible assets. &#32;Separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). Our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 77% &#32;of our total intangible asset balance of $4.7 billion . \n\nCustomer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rate, perpetuity growth rate and discount rate. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). \n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset&#8217;s (or asset group&#8217;s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. \n\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. \n\nIntangible assets were not impaired in 2012 . \n\nInvestments \n\nAs of December 31, 2012 , we had investments with a carrying value of $21 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders&#8217; equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2012 , our investments had gross unrealized gains of $825 million &#32;and gross unrealized losses of $9 million . \n\nFor debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. \n\nFor equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security&#8217;s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in our income statement. \n\nThe most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment. \n\nFair values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, its custodian, its investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nchanges in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. \n\nOther-than-temporary impairment assessment. &#32; Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations, etc.) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. \n\nWe believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses of $9 million and $32 million at December 31, 2012 &#32;and 2011 , respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during 2012 , 2011 &#32;and 2010 &#32;were $6 million , $12 million &#32;and $23 million , respectively. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2012 . We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. \n\nThe judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. \n\nAs discussed further in Item 7A &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; a 1% increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $656 million. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence (both positive and negative) for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \n\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such \n\nexaminations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions&#8217; tax court systems. \n\nThe significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2012 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $86 million. \n\nContingent Liabilities \n\nBecause of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. \n\nEstimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. \n\nGiven this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. \n\nLEGAL MATTERS \n\nA description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK \n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2012 , we had an aggregate $1.9 billion &#32;reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2012, the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as &#8220;A+.&#8221; As of December 31, 2012 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. \n\n"}
