The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and government customers. \n\nFiscal 2013 Highlights \n\nNet sales rose 9% or $14.4 billion during 2013 compared to 2012. This resulted from growth in net sales of iPhone; iTunes, software, and services; and iPad. Growth in 2013 reflects strong sales of iPhone 5, strong continuing sales of iPhone 4 and 4s, the introduction of iPhone 5c and 5s, strong performance of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad, and continued growth in the Company&#146;s online sales of apps, digital content, and services. Growth in these areas was partially offset by declines in net sales of Mac and iPod. All of the Company&#146;s operating segments experienced increased net sales in 2013, with net sales growth being particularly strong in the Americas, Greater China and Japan operating segments. Similar to 2012, growth in total net sales was higher during the first half of 2013, rising $12.6 billion or 14.7% over the same period in 2012. First half growth in 2013 was driven by iPhone and iPad introductions at or near the beginning of 2013. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2013, the Company introduced the fourth generation iPad and iPad Mini, a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, a new iPod touch, a new iMac, and expanded the rollout of iPhone 5 which began in September 2012. In June 2013 at its Worldwide Developer Conference, the Company announced iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, announced iTunes Radio, introduced a significant upgrade to MacBook Air, and provided a preview of all new Mac Pro desktops expected to be introduced during 2014. In September 2013, the Company introduced iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, released iOS 7, launched iTunes Radio, and announced that beginning in September 2013 iPhoto, iMovie and iWork apps for iOS would be available as free downloads with all new &#147;iOS devices,&#148; namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. In October 2013, the Company announced iPad Air&#153;, its fifth generation iPad, and iPad mini with Retina display. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn April 2013 the Company announced a significant increase to its program to return capital to shareholders by raising the total amount it expected to utilize for the program through December 2015 to $100 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $3.05 per common share beginning in May 2013. During 2013, the Company utilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $11.40 per common share. In conjunction with its capital return program, in May 2013 the Company issued $17.0 billion of notes with varying maturities through 2043. \n\nFiscal 2012 Highlights \n\nOverall net sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. All of the Company&#146;s operating segments experienced increased net sales during 2012, primarily a result of strong demand for iPhone and iPad. Growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. The net sales growth during the first six months of 2012 reflected the launch of iPhone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the Company&#146;s ability to meet demand more quickly for iPhone 4s when compared to the iPhone 4 launch. Growth during the first half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by strong unit sales of iPad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in iPad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011. Partially offsetting these positive factors was a decrease in iPod net sales experienced across all operating segments. \n\nIn October 2011, the Company introduced iPhone 4s and launched iCloud, the Company&#146;s cloud service that stores user data and keeps it up to date and available on multiple iOS devices and Mac and Windows personal computers. The Company introduced the third generation iPad with Retina display in March 2012 and in June 2012 introduced the MacBook Pro with Retina display and an updated MacBook Air During the fourth quarter of 2012, OS X Mountain Lion was released and iPhone 5 was introduced. \n\nIn March 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that would be executed over three years and announced plans to initiate a quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter, the Company paid dividends of $2.5 billion or $2.65 per common share. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales Data \n\nThe following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during 2013, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in millions and units in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net Sales by Operating Segment: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Americas \n\n&#160; $ 62,739 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; $ 57,512 &#160; &#160; &#160; 50% &#160; &#160; $ 38,315 &#160; Europe \n\n&#160; &#160; 37,883 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4% &#160; &#160; &#160; 36,323 &#160; &#160; &#160; 31% &#160; &#160; &#160; 27,778 &#160; Greater China (a) \n\n&#160; &#160; 25,417 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; &#160; 22,533 &#160; &#160; &#160; 78% &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,690 &#160; Japan \n\n&#160; &#160; 13,462 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27% &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,571 &#160; &#160; &#160; 94% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,437 &#160; Rest of Asia Pacific \n\n&#160; &#160; 11,181 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4% &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,741 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8% &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,902 &#160; Retail \n\n&#160; &#160; 20,228 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,828 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33% &#160; &#160; &#160; 14,127 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total net sales \n\n&#160; $ 170,910 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; $ 156,508 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45% &#160; &#160; $ 108,249 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Net Sales by Product: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; iPhone (b) \n\n&#160; $ 91,279 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16% &#160; &#160; $ 78,692 &#160; &#160; &#160; 71% &#160; &#160; $ 45,998 &#160; iPad (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 31,980 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3% &#160; &#160; &#160; 30,945 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61% &#160; &#160; &#160; 19,168 &#160; Mac (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 21,483 &#160; &#160; &#160; (7)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 23,221 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; &#160; 21,783 &#160; iPod (b) \n\n&#160; &#160; 4,411 &#160; &#160; &#160; (21)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,615 &#160; &#160; &#160; (25)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,453 &#160; iTunes, software and services (c) \n\n&#160; &#160; 16,051 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25% &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,890 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38% &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,373 &#160; Accessories (d) \n\n&#160; &#160; 5,706 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11% &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,145 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15% &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,474 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total net sales \n\n&#160; $ 170,910 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; $ 156,508 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45% &#160; &#160; $ 108,249 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Unit Sales by Product: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; iPhone \n\n&#160; &#160; 150,257 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20% &#160; &#160; &#160; 125,046 &#160; &#160; &#160; 73% &#160; &#160; &#160; 72,293 &#160; iPad \n\n&#160; &#160; 71,033 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22% &#160; &#160; &#160; 58,310 &#160; &#160; &#160; 80% &#160; &#160; &#160; 32,394 &#160; Mac \n\n&#160; &#160; 16,341 &#160; &#160; &#160; (10)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,158 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; &#160; 16,735 &#160; iPod \n\n&#160; &#160; 26,379 &#160; &#160; &#160; (25)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 35,165 &#160; &#160; &#160; (17)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 42,620 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (a) Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (b) Includes deferrals and amortization of related non-software services and software upgrade rights. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (c) Includes revenue from sales on the iTunes Store, the App Store, the Mac App Store, and the iBooks Store, and revenue from sales of AppleCare, licensing and other services. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (d) Includes sales of hardware peripherals and Apple-branded and third-party accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod. \n\n##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company&#146;s fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 ended on September 28, 2013, September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. Both fiscal years 2013 and 2011 spanned 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14 th week added to the first quarter of 2012, as is done approximately every six years to realign the Company&#146;s fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. Inclusion of the additional week in 2012 increased the Company&#146;s overall net sales and operating expenses for the year. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Performance \n\niPhone \n\nThe following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 91,279 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16% &#160; &#160; $ 78,692 &#160; &#160; &#160; 71% &#160; &#160; $ 45,998 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 53% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 50% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 42% &#160; Unit sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 150,257 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20% &#160; &#160; &#160; 125,046 &#160; &#160; &#160; 73% &#160; &#160; &#160; 72,293 &#160; ##TABLE_END The growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2013 resulted from increased demand for iPhone in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments primarily due to the launch of iPhone 5 beginning in September 2012 and strong ongoing demand for iPhone 4 and 4s. All of the Company&#146;s operating segments experienced increases in net sales and unit sales of iPhone during 2013 compared to 2012. The year-over-year impact of higher iPhone unit sales in 2013 was partially offset by a 3% decline in iPhone average selling prices (&#147;ASPs&#148;) in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower-priced iPhone models, particularly iPhone 4. All of the Company&#146;s geographic operating segments experienced a decline in iPhone ASPs during 2013. \n\nThe year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iPhone in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments, except for the Rest of Asia Pacific segment. Growth in iPhone sales during 2012 is primarily a result of the launches of iPhone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and iPhone 5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, ongoing demand during 2012 for iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS, and expanded distribution with new carriers and resellers. \n\niPad \n\nThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 31,980 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3% &#160; &#160; $ 30,945 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61% &#160; &#160; $ 19,168 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 19% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 20% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 18% &#160; Unit sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 71,033 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22% &#160; &#160; &#160; 58,310 &#160; &#160; &#160; 80% &#160; &#160; &#160; 32,394 &#160; ##TABLE_END The growth in net sales and unit sales of iPad during 2013 resulted from growth in iPad unit sales in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments. This growth was driven by the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year growth rate of total iPad unit sales was significantly higher than the growth rate of total iPad net sales for 2013 due to a reduction in iPad ASPs of 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. This decline resulted primarily from introduction of the lower priced iPad mini and the full year impact of the price reduction on iPad 2 made in 2012. The decline in iPad ASPs was experienced to various degrees by all of the Company&#146;s operating segments. \n\nThe year-over-year increase in iPad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for iPad in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments as a result of the launch of the third generation iPad in March 2012, continued demand for iPad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. The year-over-year growth rate of iPad unit sales was higher than the growth rate of iPad net sales during 2012 due to a 10% reduction in ASPs as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced iPad models, a price reduction on iPad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through third-party resellers. \n\n&#160; \n\nMac \n\nThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 21,483 &#160; &#160; &#160; (7)% &#160; &#160; $ 23,221 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; $ 21,783 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 15% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 20% &#160; Unit sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 16,341 &#160; &#160; &#160; (10)% &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,158 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; &#160; 16,735 &#160; ##TABLE_END Mac net sales and unit sales for 2013 were down or relatively flat in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments. Mac ASPs increased slightly partially offsetting the impact of lower unit sales on net sales. The decline in Mac unit sales and net sales reflects the overall weakness in the market for personal computers. \n\nThe year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects increased demand for Mac portables in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments driven by 2012 releases of updated models of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, including MacBook Pro with Retina display in June 2012. Partially offsetting the increase in net sales of Mac portables was a decline in net sales of Mac desktops that reflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012. Additionally, the Company did not introduce updated versions of its Mac desktop products in 2012. \n\niTunes, Software and Services \n\nThe following table presents net sales information of iTunes, software and services for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; iTunes, software and services \n\n&#160; $ 16,051 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25% &#160; &#160; $ 12,890 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38% &#160; &#160; $ 9,373 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; ##TABLE_END The increase in net sales of iTunes, software and services in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to growth in net sales from the iTunes Store, AppleCare and licensing. The iTunes Store generated a total of $9.3 billion in net sales during 2013, a 24% increase from 2012. Growth in the iTunes Store, which includes the App Store, the Mac App Store and the iBooks Store, reflects continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices, expanded offerings of iOS apps and related in-App purchases, and expanded offerings of iTunes digital content. \n\nThe increase in net sales of iTunes, software and services in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to growth of the iTunes Store, which generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4 billion during 2011. The strong results of the iTunes Store in 2012 reflect growth of the App Store; growth of the Company&#146;s customer base; and the continued expansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the iTunes Store. \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than those countries included in the Company&#146;s other operating segments. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Company&#146;s geographic segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company&#146;s operating segments may be found in Note 11, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data.&#148; \n\nAmericas \n\nThe following table presents Americas net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 62,739 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; $ 57,512 &#160; &#160; &#160; 50% &#160; &#160; $ 38,315 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 37% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 37% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 35% &#160; ##TABLE_END The growth in the Americas segment net sales during 2013 was driven by increased sales of iPhone following the introduction of iPhone 5 in September 2012 and iPhone 5s and 5c in September 2013, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of iPad, particularly iPad mini. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of iPod and Mac and a decline in iPad ASPs. \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, and higher sales from the iTunes Store. \n\nEurope \n\nThe following table presents Europe net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 37,883 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4% &#160; &#160; $ 36,323 &#160; &#160; &#160; 31% &#160; &#160; $ 27,778 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 22% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 23% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 26% &#160; ##TABLE_END Similar to the Americas segment, growth in net sales in the Europe segment during 2013 was primarily driven by increased sales of iPhone, iPad and higher net sales from iTunes. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod and a decline in iPad ASPs. Net sales in the Europe segment continue to be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in parts of the region reflected by second half 2013 net sales falling 4% compared to the second half of 2012, which followed an 11% increase in net sales during the first half of 2013. \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the iTunes Store and increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4s. iPhone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the Europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in net sales in the Europe segment to the extent it did in other segments. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Europe segment during 2012 compared to the Company&#146;s other geographic segments reflects growth in iPhone unit sales that was well below the growth rates experienced by the Company&#146;s other operating segments, partially offset by strong growth in iPad unit sales. Net sales in the Europe \n\n&#160; \n\nsegment were also negatively impacted by the region&#146;s uncertain economic conditions and the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to several European currencies, including the euro. \n\nGreater China \n\nThe following table presents Greater China net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 25,417 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; $ 22,533 &#160; &#160; &#160; 78% &#160; &#160; $ 12,690 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 15% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 14% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 12% &#160; ##TABLE_END The growth in net sales in the Greater China segment during 2013 resulted from two major iPhone introductions during the year, iPhone 5 in December 2012 and iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s in September 2013. Further contributing to the growth in 2013 was the introduction of the fourth generation iPad and iPad mini during the second quarter of 2013 and an increase in iPhone channel inventory as of the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012. While net sales in the China segment were up 13% for all of 2013, net sales for the second half of 2013 declined 4% compared to the second half of 2012. \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iPhone following the launch of iPhone 4s and strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2. Growth in the Greater China segment was affected by the timing of iPhone and iPad product launches. iPhone 5 was not launched in China during 2012, and the third generation iPad that was introduced by the Company in March 2012 was not launched in China until the fourth quarter of 2012. \n\nJapan \n\nThe following table presents Japan net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 13,462 &#160; &#160; &#160; 27% &#160; &#160; $ 10,571 &#160; &#160; &#160; 94% &#160; &#160; $ 5,437 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 8% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5% &#160; ##TABLE_END The increase in net sales in the Japan segment during 2013 reflects significant increases in unit volumes of iPhone and iPad, strong growth of iTunes Store net sales and an increase in iPhone channel inventory as of the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012. These positive factors were partially offset by declines in ASPs for iPhone and iPad and by weakness in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, expanded distribution with a new iPhone carrier, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the iTunes Store, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nThe following table presents Rest of Asia Pacific net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 11,181 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4% &#160; &#160; $ 10,741 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8% &#160; &#160; $ 9,902 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; ##TABLE_END The growth in net sales during 2013 was primarily driven by the launch of iPhone 5 and higher sales from iTunes, partially offset by a decrease in net sales of iPad and Mac. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to strong demand for the third generation iPad. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment experienced significantly lower year-over-year growth in net sales compared to all of the Company&#146;s other operating segments due primarily to a decrease in iPhone sales. This decrease reflects the timing of iPhone 5 launches in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment, which only occurred in a limited number of countries during the fourth quarter of 2012. \n\nRetail \n\nThe following table presents Retail net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except for store counts): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 20,228 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; &#160; $ 18,828 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33% &#160; &#160; $ 14,127 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 12% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 12% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 13% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. stores \n\n&#160; &#160; 254 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 250 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 245 &#160; International stores \n\n&#160; &#160; 162 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 140 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 112 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total store count \n\n&#160; &#160; 416 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 390 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 357 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END The growth in net sales during 2013 was primarily driven by increased unit sales of iPhone and iPad following the new product introductions in the first half of 2013 and increased sales of services. With an average of 403 and 365 open stores during 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $50.2 million in 2013, compared to $51.5 million in 2012. \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, and higher Mac net sales. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Retail segment during 2012 compared to the Company&#146;s other segments reflects the significant growth in iPad indirect distribution channel expansion. With an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3 million in 2011. \n\nThe Retail segment&#146;s operating income was $4.0 billion, $4.6 billion and $3.1 billion during 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in Retail operating income in 2013 is primarily attributable to lower gross margin similar to that experienced by the Company overall, partially offset by higher net sales. The year-over-year increase in Retail operating income in 2012 is primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during 2012. \n\nGross Margin \n\nGross margin for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Net sales \n\n&#160; $ 170,910 &#160; &#160; $ 156,508 &#160; &#160; $ 108,249 &#160; Cost of sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 106,606 &#160; &#160; &#160; 87,846 &#160; &#160; &#160; 64,431 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Gross margin \n\n&#160; $ 64,304 &#160; &#160; $ 68,662 &#160; &#160; $ 43,818 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Gross margin percentage \n\n&#160; &#160; 37.6% &#160; &#160; &#160; 43.9% &#160; &#160; &#160; 40.5% &#160; ##TABLE_END The gross margin percentage in 2013 was 37.6% compared to 43.9% in 2012. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing; a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins; introduction of iPad mini with gross margin significantly below the Company&#146;s average product margins; higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the Company&#146;s service policies and other \n\n&#160; \n\nwarranty costs; price reductions on certain products, including iPad 2 and iPhone 4; and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. \n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iPhone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. The primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iPhone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. Additionally, gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs. \n\nThe Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2014 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company&#146;s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company&#146;s future gross margin can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to those set forth above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Risk Factors&#148; and those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company&#146;s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company&#146;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company&#146;s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 4,475 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32% &#160; &#160; $ 3,381 &#160; &#160; &#160; 39% &#160; &#160; $ 2,429 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 3% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2% &#160; Selling, general and administrative \n\n&#160; $ 10,830 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8% &#160; &#160; $ 10,040 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32% &#160; &#160; $ 7,599 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 6% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7% &#160; Total operating expenses \n\n&#160; $ 15,305 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14% &#160; &#160; $ 13,421 &#160; &#160; &#160; 34% &#160; &#160; $ 10,028 &#160; Percentage of total net sales \n\n&#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 9% &#160; ##TABLE_END Research and Development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) Expense \n\nThe growth in R&#38;D expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&#38;D activities. Although total R&#38;D expense increased 32% and 39% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&#38;D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company&#146;s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&#38;D to remain competitive. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative (&#147;SG&#38;A&#148;) Expense \n\nThe growth in SG&#38;A during 2013 was primarily due to the Company&#146;s continued expansion of its Retail segment and increased headcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional \n\n&#160; \n\nservices. The growth in SG&#38;A during 2012 was primarily due to the Company&#146;s continued expansion of its Retail segment, increased headcount and related expenses, higher spending on professional services, marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the Company&#146;s net sales. \n\nOther Income and Expense \n\nOther income and expense for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Change &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Interest and dividend income \n\n&#160; $ 1,616 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 1,088 &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 519 &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; &#160; (136 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; Other expense, net \n\n&#160; &#160; (324 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; (566 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; (104 ) &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total other income/(expense), net \n\n&#160; $ 1,156 &#160; &#160; &#160; 121% &#160; &#160; $ 522 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26% &#160; &#160; $ 415 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the Company&#146;s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and remeasurement losses from foreign exchange rate movements. The overall increase in other income and expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher interest and dividend income on the Company&#146;s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03% during 2013 and 2012 and 0.77% during 2011. The Company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and 2011 and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Provision for income taxes \n\n&#160; $ 13,118 &#160; &#160; $ 14,030 &#160; &#160; $ 8,283 &#160; Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 26.2% &#160; &#160; &#160; 25.2% &#160; &#160; &#160; 24.2% &#160; ##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s effective tax rates for all periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \n\nAs of September 28, 2013, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $4.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance. \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) has completed its field audit of the Company&#146;s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2012. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any \n\n&#160; \n\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 28, 2013, September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; $ 146,761 &#160; &#160; $ 121,251 &#160; &#160; $ 81,570 &#160; Property, plant and equipment, net \n\n&#160; $ 16,597 &#160; &#160; $ 15,452 &#160; &#160; $ 7,777 &#160; Long-term debt \n\n&#160; $ 16,960 &#160; &#160; $ 0 &#160; &#160; $ 0 &#160; Working capital \n\n&#160; $ 29,628 &#160; &#160; $ 19,111 &#160; &#160; $ 17,018 &#160; Cash generated by operating activities \n\n&#160; $ 53,666 &#160; &#160; $ 50,856 &#160; &#160; $ 37,529 &#160; Cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; $ (33,774 ) &#160; $ (48,227 ) &#160; $ (40,419 ) Cash generated/(used in) by financing activities \n\n&#160; $ (16,379 ) &#160; $ (1,698 ) &#160; $ 1,444 &#160; ##TABLE_END The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. \n\nAs of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, $111.3 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company&#146;s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\nDuring 2013, cash generated from operating activities of $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion during 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $24.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2013 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $22.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $10.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9 billion. \n\nDuring 2012, cash generated from operating activities of $50.9 billion was a result of $41.7 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $9.4 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $299 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2012 of $48.2 billion consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $38.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2012 of $1.7 billion consisted primarily of cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion. \n\nCapital Assets \n\nThe Company&#146;s capital expenditures were $7.0 billion during 2013, consisting of $499 million for retail store facilities and $6.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company&#146;s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2013 were $8.2 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company anticipates utilizing approximately $11.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2014, including approximately $550 million for retail store facilities and approximately $10.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements. \n\nDuring 2014, the Company expects to open about 30 new retail stores, with approximately two-thirds located outside of the U.S. During 2014, the Company also expects to remodel approximately 20 of its existing stores. \n\nLong-Term Debt \n\nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. To manage the risk of adverse fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate notes. Of the aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion, $2.5 billion is due in 2016 and $14.5 billion is due in 2018 through 2043. \n\nDividend and Stock Repurchase Program \n\nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company raised its cash dividend by 15% to $3.05 per common share. The Company expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends of $3.05 per common share each quarter, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nIn 2012, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company&#146;s common stock. In April 2013, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $23.0 billion had been utilized as of September 28, 2013. The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 2015. The Company&#146;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. \n\nBeginning in August 2012 through December 2015, the Company anticipates it will utilize approximately $100 billion to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights, repurchase shares, and remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, of which $37.1 billion had been utilized through September 28, 2013. The following table presents the Company&#146;s dividends, share repurchases and net share settlement activity for 2013 and 2012 since the start of the program (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Dividends and Dividend Equivalent Rights Paid &#160; &#160; Accelerated Share Repurchases &#160; &#160; Open Market Share Repurchases &#160; &#160; Taxes Related to Settlement of Equity Awards &#160; &#160; Total &#160; 2012 \n\n&#160; $ 2,488 &#160; &#160; $ 0 &#160; &#160; $ 0 &#160; &#160; $ 56 &#160; &#160; $ 2,544 &#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; &#160; 10,564 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13,950 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,082 &#160; &#160; &#160; 34,596 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 13,052 &#160; &#160; $ 13,950 &#160; &#160; $ 9,000 &#160; &#160; $ 1,138 &#160; &#160; $ 37,140 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 28, 2013 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for long-term debt (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Payments Due in Less Than 1 Year &#160; &#160; Payments Due in 1-3 Years &#160; &#160; Payments Due in 4-5 Years &#160; &#160; Payments Due in More Than 5 Years &#160; &#160; Total &#160; Long-term debt \n\n&#160; $ 0 &#160; &#160; $ 2,500 &#160; &#160; $ 6,000 &#160; &#160; $ 8,500 &#160; &#160; $ 17,000 &#160; Operating leases \n\n&#160; &#160; 610 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,200 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,056 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,855 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,721 &#160; Purchase obligations \n\n&#160; &#160; 18,616 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,616 &#160; Other obligations \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,081 &#160; &#160; &#160; 248 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,348 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total \n\n&#160; $ 20,307 &#160; &#160; $ 3,948 &#160; &#160; $ 7,072 &#160; &#160; $ 10,358 &#160; &#160; $ 41,685 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ##TABLE_END Lease Commitments \n\nThe Company&#146;s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 28, 2013, the Company&#146;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.7 billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail space. \n\nPurchase Commitments with Outsourcing Partners and Component Suppliers \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company&#146;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of September 28, 2013, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $18.6 billion. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $1.3 billion as of September 28, 2013, that consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. \n\nThe Company&#146;s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 28, 2013, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. Additionally, as of September 28, 2013, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.7 billion and an additional $590 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \n\nIndemnification \n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by \n\n&#160; \n\nthe Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 28, 2013 or September 29, 2012. \n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and the Company&#146;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#146;s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#148; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\nManagement believes the Company&#146;s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company&#146;s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product&#146;s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product&#146;s essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (&#147;VSOE&#148;), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (&#147;TPE&#148;) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (&#147;ESP&#148;). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company&#146;s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company&#146;s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company&#146;s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. \n\nThe Company&#146;s process for determining ESPs involves management&#146;s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company&#146;s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights, the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services, and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. \n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company&#146;s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company&#146;s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management&#146;s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\nThe Company&#146;s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities \n\n&#160; \n\nimpact the Company&#146;s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security&#146;s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company&#146;s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company&#146;s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. \n\nInventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#146; facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. \n\nThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or manufacturing-related capital assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company&#146;s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company&#146;s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company&#146;s suppliers that hold any of the Company&#146;s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\nThe Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Company&#146;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company&#146;s products, if the Company&#146;s product development plans change, or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company&#146;s products, then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\nWarranty Costs \n\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates \n\n&#160; \n\nthese estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#146;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, &#147;Commitments and Contingencies,&#148; the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#146;s expectations, the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START "}
