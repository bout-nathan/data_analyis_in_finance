Caterpillar ended 2022 with $7.0 billion of enterprise cash. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nOur sales and revenues for 2022 were $59.427 billion, an increase of $8.456 billion, or 17 percent, compared with $50.971 billion for 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume , partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. Profit per share was $12.64 in 2022, compared with profit per share of $11.83 in 2021. Profit was $6.705 billion in 2022, compared with $6.489 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs , a goodwill impairment charge, higher selling, general and administrative (SG&#38;A) and research and development (R&#38;D) expenses, lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans and higher restructuring costs. \n\nTrends and Economic Conditions \n\nOutlook for Key End Markets \n\nIn Construction Industries, we see positive momentum in 2023 for North America. We expect non-residential construction in North America to grow due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments, healthy backlogs and rental replenishment. Residential construction continues to moderate due to tightening financial conditions but remains at a healthy level. In Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth due to public infrastructure spending and supportive commodity prices. We expect continued weakness in China in the excavator industry above 10-tons, which we anticipate to remain below 2022 levels due to low construction activity. In EAME , business activity is expected to be about flat versus 2022 based on healthy backlogs and strong construction demand in the Middle East, offset by uncertain economic conditions in Europe. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to be flat to slightly down versus a strong 2022 performance. \n\nIn Resource Industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds; however, customers continue to remain capital disciplined. We anticipate production and utilization levels will remain elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to gain momentum. We expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of parked trucks, which support future demand for our equipment and services. The energy transition is expected to support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing opportunities for profitable growth. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth supported by infrastructure and major non-residential construction projects. \n\nIn Energy &#38; Transportation, we expect sales growth due to strong order rates in most applications. In Oil &#38; Gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in demand and order intake for the year. New equipment orders for Solar Turbines continue to be robust. Power Generation orders are expected to remain healthy, including data center strength. Industrial remains healthy with momentum continuing for 2023. In Rail, North America new locomotives are expected to remain muted. We anticipate strength in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets. \n\nCompany Trends and Expectations \n\nFor the full-year 2023, we expect sales to increase compared to 2022, supported by favorable price realization. Although we expect stronger sales of equipment to end users in 2023, we do not anticipate a significant change in dealer inventory by year end. 2023 sales are expected to follow a more traditional seasonal pattern, with first quarter being the lowest of the year. Demand remains strong given the robust order backlog and improving supply chain dynamics. In addition, services momentum is expected to continue this year as we continue to execute our services growth strategy. \n\nWe expect sales to increase in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by favorable price realization and slightly stronger sales volume, which reflects higher sales of equipment to end users. We expect a seasonal build in dealer inventory in the first quarter of 2023. Sales should increase across the three primary segments in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022. \n\nWe expect operating profit to increase in 2023, compared to 2022. Pricing actions from 2022 will continue to impact 2023 and we will evaluate future actions as appropriate to offset inflationary pressures. We currently expect to see moderation of price realization and input cost inflation throughout 2023. Price realization is expected to more than offset manufacturing costs for 2023. Increases in SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses are expected to exceed the benefit of lower short-term incentive compensation expense in 2023 as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives such as services growth and technology, including digital, electrification and autonomy. We anticipate higher pension expense within other income (expense) in 2023, compared to 2022, due to higher interest costs from higher interest rates. This non-cash item is estimated to be just over $300 million for the full year, or about $80 million per quarter. Finally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2022 acted as a benefit to profit within other income (expense), which would not re-occur if the weakening we have seen in rates continues. \n\nGlobal Business Conditions \n\nWe continue to monitor a variety of external factors around the world, such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost and labor pressures. Areas of particular focus include certain components, transportation and raw materials. Transportation shortages have resulted in delays and increased costs. In addition, our suppliers are dealing with availability issues and freight delays, which could impact production in our facilities. Contingency plans have been developed and continue to be modified to minimize supply chain challenges that may impact our ability to meet increasing customer demand. We continue to assess the environment and are taking appropriate price actions in response to rising costs. \n\nRisk Factors \n\nRisk factors are disclosed within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2022 Form 10-K. \n\nNotes: \n\n&#8226; Glossary of terms included on pages 35-37; first occurrence of terms shown in bold italics. \n\n&#8226; Information on non-GAAP financial measures is included on page 49. \n\n&#8226; Some amounts within this report are rounded to the millions or billions and may not add. In addition, the sum of the components reported across periods may not equal the total amount reported year-to-date due to rounding. \n\n2022 COMPARED WITH 2021 \n\nCONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2021 (at left) and 2022 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company&#8217;s Board of Directors and employees. \n\nTotal sales and revenues for 2022 were $59.427 billion, an increase of $8.456 billion, or 17 percent, compared with $50.971 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The increase in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories , increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users. Dealers increased their inventories about $2.4 billion in 2022, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021. \n\nSales were higher in the three primary segments. \n\nNorth America sales increased 29 percent driven by favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories, increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users. Dealers increased inventories during 2022, compared to a decrease during 2021. \n\nSales increased 33 percent in Latin America due to higher sales of equipment to end users, favorable price realization and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers increased inventories more during 2022 than during 2021. \n\nEAME sales increased 6 percent due to favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher sales of equipment to end users, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro and British pound. Dealers increased inventories more during 2022 than during 2021. \n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 2 percent driven by favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher services, partially offset by lower sales of equipment to end users and unfavorable currency impacts related to the Australian dollar and Japanese yen. Dealers increased their inventories during 2022, compared to remaining about flat during 2021. \n\nDealers increased their inventories about $2.4 billion in 2022, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers&#8217; demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We expect dealer inventories to be about flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Segment (Millions of dollars) 2021 Sales Volume Price Realization Currency Inter-Segment / Other 2022 $ Change % Change Construction Industries $ 22,106 $ 1,231 $ 2,633 $ (731) $ 30 $ 25,269 $ 3,163 14 % Resource Industries 9,810 1,372 1,333 (194) (7) 12,314 2,504 26 % Energy &#38; Transportation 20,287 1,972 1,216 (521) 798 23,752 3,465 17 % All Other Segment 511 3 4 (7) (61) 450 (61) (12 %) Corporate Items and Eliminations (4,526) 82 (7) &#8212; (760) (5,211) (685) &#160; Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation 48,188 4,660 5,179 (1,453) &#8212; 56,574 8,386 17 % Financial Products Segment 3,073 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 180 3,253 180 6 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (290) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; (110) (400) (110) &#160; \n\nFinancial Products Revenues \n\n2,783 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 70 2,853 70 3 % Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 50,971 $ 4,660 $ 5,179 $ (1,453) $ 70 $ 59,427 $ 8,456 17 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region North America Latin America EAME Asia/Pacific External Sales and Revenues Inter-Segment Total Sales and Revenues (Millions of dollars) $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Construction Industries $ 12,367 28% $ 2,843 49% $ 5,099 5% $ 4,818 (13%) $ 25,127 14% $ 142 27% $ 25,269 14 % Resource Industries 4,531 52% 1,840 7% 2,205 11% 3,437 23% 12,013 26% 301 (2%) 12,314 26 % Energy &#38; Transportation 9,175 21% 1,784 45% 5,232 7% 3,146 8% 19,337 16% 4,415 22% 23,752 17 % All Other Segment 64 14% 2 &#8212;% (66) (467%) 145 110% 145 &#8212;% 305 (17%) 450 (12 %) Corporate Items and Eliminations (29) (1) (5) (13) (48) (5,163) (5,211) Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation 26,108 29% 6,468 33% 12,465 6% 11,533 2% 56,574 17% &#8212; &#8212;% 56,574 17 % Financial Products Segment 2,078 7% 348 31% 396 (1%) 431 (8%) 3,253 1 \n\n6% &#8212; &#8212;% 3,253 6 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (205) (78) (47) (70) (400) &#8212; (400) Financial Products Revenues 1,873 4% 270 26% 349 (5%) 361 (10%) 2,853 3% &#8212; &#8212;% 2,853 3 % Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 27,981 27% $ 6,738 32% $ 12,814 6% $ 11,894 1% $ 59,427 17% $ &#8212; &#8212;% $ 59,427 17 % 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Construction Industries $ 9,676 $ 1,913 $ 4,858 $ 5,547 $ 21,994 &#160; $ 112 $ 22,106 Resource Industries 2,987 1,724 1,987 2,804 9,502 &#160; 308 9,810 Energy &#38; Transportation 7,611 1,233 4,908 2,918 16,670 &#160; 3,617 20,287 All Other Segment 56 2 18 69 145 &#160; 366 511 Corporate Items and Eliminations (106) (1) (1) (15) (123) &#160; (4,403) (4,526) Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation 20,224 4,871 11,770 11,323 48,188 &#160; &#8212; 48,188 &#160; Financial Products Segment 1,935 265 402 471 3,073 1 \n\n&#160; &#8212; 3,073 Corporate Items and Eliminations (136) (50) (35) (69) (290) &#160; &#8212; (290) Financial Products Revenues 1,799 215 367 402 2,783 &#160; &#8212; 2,783 &#160; Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 22,023 $ 5,086 $ 12,137 $ 11,725 $ 50,971 &#160; $ &#8212; $ 50,971 \n\n1 Includes revenues from Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation of $478 million and $351 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2021 (at left) and 2022 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company&#8217;s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation other operating (income) expenses . \n\nOperating profit was $7.904 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.026 billion, or 15 percent, compared with $6.878 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, a goodwill impairment charge, higher SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses and higher restructuring costs. \n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher material costs, freight and manufacturing inefficiencies. The increase in SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with the company's strategy for profitable growth, which included services growth and technology, such as digital, electrification and autonomy, as well as higher short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Expense for 2022 was about $1.4 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in 2021. For 2023, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.1 billion. \n\nIn 2022, the company took a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million and restructuring costs of $193 million related to the Rail division, both primarily non-cash items. $180 million of the total Rail restructuring costs were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022. The goodwill impairment charge is related to a lower outlook for the company&#8217;s locomotive offerings. The restructuring costs were primarily related to write-downs in the value of inventory. \n\nOperating profit margin was 13.3 percent in 2022, compared with 13.5 percent in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Profit (Loss) by Segment (Millions of dollars) 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Construction Industries $ 4,743 $ 3,732 $ 1,011 27 % Resource Industries 1,827 1,229 598 49 % Energy &#38; Transportation 3,309 2,804 505 18 % All Other Segment (11) (14) 3 21 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (2,435) (1,388) (1,047) &#160; Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation 7,433 6,363 1,070 17 % Financial Products Segment 864 908 (44) (5 %) Corporate Items and Eliminations 26 (92) 118 &#160; Financial Products 890 816 74 9 % Consolidating Adjustments (419) (301) (118) &#160; Consolidated Operating Profit $ 7,904 $ 6,878 $ 1,026 15 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOther Profit/Loss and Tax Items \n\n&#8226; Interest expense excluding Financial Products in 2022 was $443 million, compared with $488 million in 2021.

The change was primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of OPEB plans, lower pension and OPEB income and unrealized losses on marketable securities, partially offset by higher investment and interest income. \n\n&#8226; The provision for income taxes for 2022 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 23.2 percent, compared with 22.9 percent for 2021, excluding the discrete items discussed below. \n\nOn September 8, 2022, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that resolves all issues for tax years 2007 through 2016, without any penalties. The company&#8217;s settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) from certain parts transactions. We vigorously contested the IRS&#8217;s application of the &#8220;substance-over-form&#8221; or &#8220;assignment-of-income&#8221; judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. The settlement does not include any increases to tax in the United States based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with the associated interest of $250 million. The settlement was within the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and enables us to avoid the costs and burdens of further disputes with the IRS. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $41 million in 2022 to reflect changes in estimates of prior years&#8217; taxes and related interest, net of tax. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS, and tax years 2017 to 2019 are currently under examination. \n\nThe provision for income taxes also included the following: \n\n&#9702; A tax charge of $124 million related to $606 million of pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains in 2022, compared to a $190 million tax charge related to $833 million of mark-to-market gains in 2021. \n\n&#9702; A tax benefit of $49 million to reflect other changes in estimates related to prior year&#8217;s U.S. taxes in 2022 compared to $36 million in 2021. \n\n&#9702; A tax benefit of $36 million related to the $925 million goodwill impairment charge in 2022. \n\n&#9702; A tax benefit of $33 million in 2022, compared with $63 million in 2021, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. \n\n&#9702; A tax benefit of $38 million in 2021 to recognize U.S. capital losses. \n\nConstruction Industries \n\nConstruction Industries&#8217; total sales were $25.269 billion in 2022, an increase of $3.163 billion, or 14 percent, compared with $22.106 billion in 2021. The increase was due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, Japanese yen and Australian dollar. The increase in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher sales of aftermarket parts, partially offset by lower sales of equipment to end users. Dealers increased inventories during 2022, compared to remaining about flat in 2021. \n\n&#8226; In North America, sales increased due to favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher sales of equipment to end users and higher sales of aftermarket parts. Dealers decreased inventories during 2021, compared with an increase during 2022. \n\n&#8226; Sales increased in Latin America primarily due to higher sales of equipment to end users, favorable price realization and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers increased inventories more during 2022 than during 2021. \n\n&#8226; In EAME, sales increased due to favorable price realization and the impact from changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro.

The increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses. Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material costs, freight and the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies. The increase in SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives. \n\nConstruction Industries&#8217; profit as a percent of total sales was 18.8 percent in 2022, compared with 16.9 percent in 2021. \n\nResource Industries \n\nResource Industries&#8217; total sales were $12.314 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.504 billion, or 26 percent, compared with $9.810 billion in 2021. The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. The increase in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher sales of equipment to end users and higher sales of aftermarket parts. Dealers increased inventories during 2022, compared with a decrease during 2021. \n\nResource Industries&#8217; profit was $1.827 billion in 2022, an increase of $598 million, or 49 percent, compared with $1.229 billion in 2021. The increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses. Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material costs and freight. The increase in SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives. \n\nResource Industries&#8217; profit as a percent of total sales was 14.8 percent for 2022, compared with 12.5 percent for 2021. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation \n\n##TABLE_START Sales by Application (Millions of dollars) 2022 2021 $ Change % \n\n&#160; Change \n\nOil and Gas $ 5,330 $ 4,460 $ 870 20 % Power Generation 4,940 4,292 648 15 % Industrial 4,426 3,612 814 23 % Transportation 4,641 4,306 335 8 % External Sales 19,337 16,670 2,667 16 % Inter-Segment 4,415 3,617 798 22 % Total Sales $ 23,752 $ 20,287 $ 3,465 17 % ##TABLE_END\n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s total sales were $23.752 billion in 2022, an increase of $3.465 billion, or 17 percent, compared with $20.287 billion in 2021. Sales increased across all applications and inter-segment sales. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, British pound and Australian dollar. \n\n&#8226; Oil and Gas &#8211; Sales increased due to higher sales of reciprocating engine aftermarket parts and engines used in well servicing and gas compression applications. Turbines and turbine-related services were about flat. \n\n&#8226; Power Generation &#8211; Sales primarily increased in reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts. \n\n&#8226; Industrial &#8211; Sales increased due to higher demand across all regions. \n\n&#8226; Transportation &#8211; Sales increased primarily in reciprocating aftermarket parts and engines, mostly driven by marine applications. Rail services also increased. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s profit was $3.309 billion in 2022, an increase of $505 million, or 18 percent, compared with $2.804 billion in 2021. Unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses were more than offset by favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material costs, freight, period manufacturing costs and the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies. The increase in SG&#38;A/R&#38;D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s profit as a percent of total sales was 13.9 percent in 2022, compared with 13.8 percent in 2021. \n\nFinancial Products Segment \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; segment revenues were $3.253 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $180 million, or 6 percent, compared with $3.073 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions and a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in North America. \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; segment profit was $864 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $44 million, or 5 percent, compared with $908 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services, partially offset by a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment. \n\nAt the end of 2022, past dues at Cat Financial were 1.89 percent, compared with 1.95 percent at the end of 2021. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $46 million for 2022, compared with $205 million for 2021. As of December 31, 2022, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $346 million, or 1.29 percent of finance receivables, compared with $337 million, or 1.22 percent of finance receivables, at December 31, 2021. \n\nCorporate Items and Eliminations \n\nExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.409 billion in 2022, an increase of $929 million from 2021, primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by favorable impacts of segment reporting methodology and a favorable change in fair value adjustments related to deferred compensation plans. \n\nIn 2022, the company took a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million and restructuring costs of $193 million related to the Rail division, both primarily non-cash items. $180 million of the total Rail restructuring costs were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022. The goodwill impairment charge is related to a lower outlook for the company&#8217;s locomotive offerings. The restructuring costs were primarily related to write-downs in the value of inventory. \n\n2021 COMPARED WITH 2020 \n\nFor discussions related to the consolidated sales and revenue and consolidated operating profit between 2021 and 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2022 and hereby incorporated by reference. \n\nRESTRUCTURING COSTS \n\nOn February 1, 2023, we closed on the divestiture of our Longwall business. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $600 million, of which $494 million was related to the release of accumulated foreign currency translation associated with this divestiture. This loss, primarily non-cash, will be included in our first quarter 2023 restructuring costs and is subject to the finalization of post-closing procedures. In addition, we expect to incur about $100 million of restructuring costs in 2023 primarily related to strategic actions to address a small number of products. \n\nWe expect that prior restructuring actions will result in an incremental benefit to operating costs, primarily Costs of goods sold and SG&#38;A expenses of about $100 million in 2023 compared with 2022. \n\nAdditional information related to restructuring costs is included in Note 25 - \"Restructuring Costs\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\" \n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \n\n1.

Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products&#8217; operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. During 2022, we had positive operating cash flow within both our ME&#38;T and Financial Products' operations. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2022 with $7.00 billion of cash, a decrease of $2.25 billion from year-end 2021. In addition, ME&#38;T has invested in available-for-sale debt securities that are considered highly liquid and are available for current operations. These securities are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and were $1.48 billion at the end of December 31, 2022. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated operating cash flow for 2022 was $7.77 billion, up $568 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and decreased working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in receivables, customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow, but were partially offset by changes in accounts payable. Partially offsetting these items were higher payments for short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2022 as well as higher cash taxes paid which includes payments related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. \n\nTotal debt as of December 31, 2022 was $36.99 billion, a decrease of $796 million from year-end 2021. Debt related to ME&#38;T decreased $174 million in 2022. Debt related to Financial products decreased by $617 million due to portfolio funding requirements. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management&#8217;s allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&#38;T as of December 31, 2022 was $2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows: \n\n&#8226; In September 2022, we entered into a new 364-day facility. The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $825 million is available to ME&#38;T) expires in August 2023. \n\n&#8226; In September 2022, we amended and restated the three-year facility (as amended and restated, the \"three-year facility\"). The three-year facility of $2.73 billion (of which $715 million is available to ME&#38;T) expires in August 2025. \n\n&#8226; In September 2022, we amended and restated the five-year facility (as amended and restated, the \"five-year facility\"). The five-year facility of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&#38;T) expires in September 2027. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Caterpillar&#8217;s consolidated net worth was $15.93 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders' equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Cat Financial&#8217;s covenant interest coverage ratio was 2.36 to 1. This was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. \n\nIn addition, at December 31, 2022, Cat Financial&#8217;s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.05 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.21 to 1. This was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. \n\nIn the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. \n\nOur total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2022 were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 (Millions of dollars) Consolidated Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation Financial Products Credit lines available: &#160; &#160; &#160; Global credit facilities $ 10,500 &#160; $ 2,750 &#160; $ 7,750 &#160; Other external 3,649 &#160; 158 &#160; 3,491 &#160; Total credit lines available 14,149 &#160; 2,908 &#160; 11,241 &#160; Less: Commercial paper outstanding (5,455) &#8212; &#160; (5,455) Less: Utilized credit (982) (3) (979) Available credit $ 7,712 &#160; $ 2,905 &#160; $ 4,807 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2022 totaled $3.65 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s, Fitch and S&#38;P maintain a &#8220;mid-A&#8221; debt rating. A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&#38;T&#8217;s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products&#8217; operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. \n\nWe facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs (the &#8220;Programs&#8221;) through participating financial institutions. The Programs are available to a wide range of suppliers and allow them the option to manage their cash flow. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the Programs. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Programs. The amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the Programs and included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were $862 million and $822 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The amounts settled through the Programs and paid to participating financial institutions were $5.4 billion and $4.1 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We account for payments made under the Programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity. \n\nMaterial cash requirements for contractual obligations \n\nWe believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $7.00 billion and available-for-sale debt securities of $1.48 billion as of December 31, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nWe have committed cash outflows related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. See Notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for additional information. \n\nWe have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These cons ist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2022, but scheduled for payment in 2023 of $8.69 billion. In addition, we have contractual obligations for material and services on order at December 31, 2022, but not yet invoiced or delivered, of $7.64 billion. \n\nWe also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development contracts; information technology consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration. These obligations total $1.06 billion, with $537 million due in the next 12 months. \n\nMachinery, Energy &#38; Transportation \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6.36 billion in 2022, compared with $7.18 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to payments for short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2022, higher payments for taxes which includes payments related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and increased working capital requirements in 2022. Within working capital, changes in accounts payable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in customer advances and accounts receivable. Partially offsetting these items were higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items. \n\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2022 was $1.81 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.23 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to decreased activity related to intercompany lending with Financial Products and was partially offset by decreases in net investment activity. \n\nNet cash used for financing activities during 2022 was $6.80 billion, compared with net cash used of $6.30 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to higher share repurchases in 2022 and the absence of proceeds from debt issuance which occurred in 2021. These items were partially offset by lower repayments of maturing debt in 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nStrong financial position &#8212; Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies. \n\nOperational excellence and commitments &#8212; Capital expenditures were $1.30 billion during 2022, compared to $1.13 billion in 2021. We expect ME&#38;T&#8217;s capital expenditures in 2023 to be around $1.5 billion. We made $346 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans during 2022. In comparison, we made $340 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2021. We expect to make approximately $372 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nFund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders &#8212; We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services, including acquisitions. \n\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, ME&#38;T free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We define ME&#38;T free cash flow as cash from ME&#38;T operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions and cash payments related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. A goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all ME&#38;T free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating. \n\nOur share repurchase plans are subject to the company&#8217;s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2018 Authorization) effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. In May 2022, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization (the 2022 Authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective August 1, 2022 with no expiration. Utilization of the 2022 Authorization for all share repurchases commenced on August 1, 2022, leaving $70 million unutilized under the 2018 Authorization. In 2022, we repurchased $4.23 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with $12.8 billion remaining under the 2022 Authorization as of December 31, 2022. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were approximately 516 million. \n\nEach quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In December 2022, the Board of Directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.20 per share and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. Dividends paid totaled $2.44 billion in 2022. \n\nFinancial Products \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Products operating cash flow was $1.52 billion in 2022, compared with $1.42 billion in 2021. Net cash used for investing activities was $356 million in 2022, compared with $1.40 billion used in 2021. The change was primarily due to portfolio related activity partially offset by lower proceeds from disposal of equipment. Net cash used for financing activities was $964 million in 2022, compared with net cash provided of $257 million in 2021. The change was primarily due to lower portfolio funding requirements. \n\nOff-balance sheet arrangements \n\nWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21 &#8211; &#8220;Guarantees and product warranty&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1J &#8212; &#8220;New accounting guidance&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. We review these assumptions at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each. \n\n&#160; \n\nResidual values for leased assets &#8211; We determine the residual value of Cat Financial&#8217;s leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. \n\nUpon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third-party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price. \n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term. \n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.71 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense. \n\nFair values for goodwill impairment tests &#8211; We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. \n\nWe review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss. \n\nFor reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. We compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit&#8217;s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant&#8217;s perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. We categorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. \n\nOur annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, with the exception of our Rail reporting unit. \n\nThe Rail reporting unit is a part of our Energy &#38; Transportation segment. Rail&#8217;s product portfolio includes diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated that the fair value of Rail was below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million, resulting in a full impairment of Rail&#8217;s goodwill balance as of October 1, 2022. There was a $36 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The valuation of the Rail reporting unit was based on estimates of future cash flows, which assumed a reduced demand forecast, lower margins due to continued inflationary cost pressures, and a discount rate approximately 140 basis points higher than utilized in the prior year valuation. The reduction in the demand forecast in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by fourth quarter commercial developments, resulting in a lower outlook for the Company&#8217;s locomotive offerings. \n\nAn unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. We would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nWarranty liability &#8211; At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs. We determine the warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve &#8211; We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2022 and 2021 consisted of unearned insurance premiums. \n\n&#160; \n\nPostretirement benefits &#8211; We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. \n\nPrimary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows: \n\n&#8226; We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today&#8217;s dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar&#8217;s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and expense. \n\n&#8226; The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, December 31. \n\n&#8226; We use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. \n\n&#8226; The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. \n\n&#8226; We use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. An increase in the life expectancy of plan participants will result in an increase in our obligation and expense. \n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nPostretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effects of a one percentage-point change in certain actuarial assumptions on 2022 pension and OPEB costs and obligations are as follows: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 Benefit Cost Increase (Decrease) Year-end Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) One percentage- point increase One percentage- point decrease One percentage- point increase One percentage- point decrease \n\nU.S. Pension Benefits: 1 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assumed discount rate $ 101 &#160; $ (131) $ (1,151) $ 1,363 &#160; Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (167) 167 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-U.S. Pension Benefits: Assumed discount rate 17 &#160; (24) (311) 380 &#160; Expected rate of compensation increase 5 &#160; (4) 28 &#160; (22) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (41) 41 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other Postretirement Benefits: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assumed discount rate 9 &#160; (11) (218) 254 &#160; Expected rate of compensation increase &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; (1) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (2) 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 Effective December 31, 2019, all U.S. pension benefits were frozen, and accordingly the expected rate of compensation increase assumption is no longer applicable. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nActuarial Assumptions \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; U.S. Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation, end of year: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 5.4 &#160; % 2.8 % 2.4 % 4.3 &#160; % 1.8 % 1.4 % 5.4 &#160; % 2.7 % 2.3 % Rate of compensation increase 1 \n\n&#8212; &#160; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 2.3 &#160; % 2.0 % 2.0 % 4.0 &#160; % 4.0 % 4.0 % Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate used to measure service cost 1 \n\n&#8212; &#160; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 1.7 &#160; % 1.4 % 1.5 % 2.8 &#160; % 2.5 % 3.2 % Discount rate used to measure interest cost 2.3 &#160; % 1.8 % 2.8 % 1.7 &#160; % 1.2 % 1.7 % 2.2 &#160; % 1.6 % 2.8 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 4.0 &#160; % 4.2 % 5.1 % 3.1 &#160; % 2.9 % 3.3 % 6.9 &#160; % 6.5 % 7.0 % Rate of compensation increase 1 \n\n&#8212; &#160; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 2.0 &#160; % 2.0 % 2.0 % 4.0 &#160; % 4.0 % 4.0 % Health care cost trend rates at year-end: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Health care trend rate assumed for next year 6.5 &#160; % 5.6 % 5.8 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 4.7 &#160; % 5.0 % 5.0 % Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate 2030 2025 2025 1 Effective December 31, 2019, all U.S. pension benefits were frozen, and accordingly this assumption is no longer applicable. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 12 - &#8220;Postemployment benefit plans&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplemental Data&#8221; for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\nPost-sale discount reserve &#8211; We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. We adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material. \n\n&#160; \n\nAllowance for credit losses - The allowance for credit losses is management&#8217;s estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industry-specific economic factors. In addition, we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models, including borrower-specific and company-specific factors. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. \n\nWe measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist. We identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on past due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. \n\nWhile management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. \n\nIncome taxes &#8211; We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received. \n\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#8217;s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\nDeferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. \n\nAdditional information related to income taxes is included in Note 6 - &#8220;Income taxes&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation related to legal proceedings appears in Note 22&#8212;Environmental and Legal Matters of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nRETIREMENT BENEFITS \n\nWe recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. \n\nThe table below summarizes the amounts of net periodic benefit cost recognized for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and includes expected cost for 2023. \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars) 2023 Expected \n\n2022 2021 2020 U.S. Pension Benefits $ (33) $ (268) $ (388) $ (309) Non-U.S. Pension Benefits 1 &#160; (10) (19) 18 Other Postretirement Benefits 188 &#160; 161 &#160; 118 147 Mark-to-market loss (gain) &#8212; &#160; 1 \n\n(606) (833) 383 Total net periodic benefit cost (benefit) $ 156 &#160; $ (723) $ (1,122) $ 239 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Expected net periodic benefit cost (benefit) does not include an estimate for mark-to-market gains or losses. \n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; Expected increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 - Excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, our net periodic benefit cost is expected to increase $273 million in 2023. This expected increase is primarily due to higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022 (U.S. pension plans discount rate for 2023 interest cost is 5.2 percent compared to 2.3 percent for 2022) which is partially offset by higher expected return on plan assets in 2023 (U.S. pension plans expected return on plans assets is 5.8 percent for 2023 compared to 4.0 percent in 2022). \n\n&#8226; Increase in expense in 2022 compared to 2021 - Primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2022 compared to 2021 and higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2021. \n\n&#8226; Decrease in expense in 2021 compared to 2020 - Primarily due to mark-to-market gains in 2021 compared to mark-to-market losses in 2020 and lower interest cost in 2021 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2020. \n\nThe primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are described below. We include the net mark-to-market losses (gains) in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations. \n\n&#8226; 2022 net mark-to-market gain of $606 million - Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2022 compared to the end of 2021. This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual loss rate of (22.6) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.0 percent). \n\n&#8226; 2021 net mark-to-market gain of $833 million - Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020. This was partially offset by various assumption changes and a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 3.6 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.2 percent). \n\n&#8226; 2020 net mark-to-market loss of $383 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019. This was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 16.7 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.1 percent). \n\nSENSITIVITY \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitivity \n\n&#160; \n\nME&#38;T operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&#38;T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2023 cash flow for our ME&#38;T operations by approximately $98 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $89 million adverse impact on 2022 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. \n\nThe effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Mexican peso, Indian rupee and Euro. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity \n\n&#160; \n\nFor our ME&#38;T operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2023 pre-tax earnings of ME&#38;T. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2022 pre-tax earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio. Match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2022 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2023 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2022 pre-tax earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nThis analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nWe provide the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. \n\nWe believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of three significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) goodwill impairment, (ii) restructuring costs and (iii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses resulting from plan remeasurements. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our period-over-period results. In addition, we provide a calculation of ME&#38;T free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\nReconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions except per share data) Operating Profit Operating Profit Margin Profit Before Taxes Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate Profit Profit per Share Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 - U.S. GAAP $ 7,904 &#160; 13.3 &#160; % $ 8,752 &#160; $ 2,067 &#160; 23.6 &#160; % $ 6,705 &#160; $ 12.64 &#160; Goodwill impairment 925 1.6 &#160; % 925 36 3.9 % 889 1.68 Restructuring costs 299 0.5 % 299 72 24.0 % 227 0.43 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses $ &#8212; &#8212; % (606) (124) 20.5 % (482) (0.91) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 - Adjusted $ 9,128 15.4 % $ 9,370 $ 2,051 21.9 % $ 7,339 $ 13.84 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 - U.S. GAAP $ 6,878 &#160; 13.5 &#160; % $ 8,204 &#160; $ 1,742 &#160; 21.2 &#160; % $ 6,489 &#160; $ 11.83 &#160; Restructuring costs 90 0.2 % 90 4 4.4 % 86 $ 0.15 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses &#8212; &#8212; % (833) (190) 22.8 % (643) $ (1.17) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 - Adjusted $ 6,968 13.7 % $ 7,461 $ 1,556 20.9 % $ 5,932 $ 10.81 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nReconciliations of ME&#38;T free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Millions of dollars Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 \n\nME&#38;T net cash provided by operating activities 1 \n\n$ 6,358 &#160; $ 7,177 ME&#38;T discretionary pension contributions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; ME&#38;T capital expenditures (1,298) (1,129) Cash payments related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 717 &#160; &#8212; ME&#38;T free cash flow $ 5,777 &#160; $ 6,048 \n\n1 See reconciliation of ME&#38;T net cash provided by operating activities to consolidated net cash provided by operating activities on page 53. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental Consolidating Data \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis.
