We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. \n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nUnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State and UnitedHealthcare International; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumHealth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumInsight; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumRx. \n\n##TABLE_END Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221; and in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\n2014 Business Realignment. On January 1, 2014, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. Our Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, will be included in OptumInsight&#8217;s results of operations. Our periodic filings with the SEC beginning with our first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx). \n\nBusiness Trends \n\nOur businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the United States, health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including enacted health care reforms in the United States, which could also impact our results of operations. \n\nPricing Trends . We seek to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, and competitive dynamics (such as product positioning and price competitiveness) and legislative and regulatory changes such as cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of Health Reform Legislation. We continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates. Aggregating UnitedHealthcare&#8217;s businesses, and before giving effect to Health Reform Legislation taxes, we believe the medical care ratio will rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the emerging public health benefit exchange market. \n\nIn response to Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a review threshold of annual commercial premium rate increases generally at or above 10% and enacted a new rule requiring the production of information for any proposed rate increase. HHS review does not supersede existing state review and approval procedures. We have experienced regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. The competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases. Further, our rates and rate filings are developed using methods \n\nconsistent with the standards of actuarial practices and we endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business. We have requested and received rate increases above 10% in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform. We expect commercial pricing to continue to be highly competitive. The intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. Overall, the industry has experienced lower medical costs trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. Conversely, carriers are generally reflecting the 2014 Health Reform Legislation industry fees in their pricing. In some markets, competitors have adjusted their pricing to reflect recent medical cost trend experience as well as the implication of rate review rules and new benefit changes from Health Reform Legislation. In other areas we are seeing greater price competition due to pricing adjustments and other varied approaches used by competitors. \n\nThe Medicare Advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years, with additional reductions to take effect in 2014 and 2015, as discussed below in &#8220;Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.&#8221; We expect these factors to result in year-over-year pressure on gross margin percentages for our Medicare business during 2014. \n\nStates are struggling to balance budget pressures with increases in their Medicaid expenditures. During 2013, rate changes for some Medicaid programs were slightly negative year-over-year. In general, we expect continued pressure on net margin percentages due to the Medicaid reimbursement rate environment, which we expect will remain tight due to the potential non-collectability of the insurer fee primarily related to Medicare Dual SNP programs and Medicaid. We continue to work with our state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends, including fees and related taxes, and to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing Medicaid contracts. \n\nMedical Cost Trends. We expect our 2014 commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.0% plus or minus 50 basis points, compared to approximately 5% in 2013. In 2014, we expect relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2013, before taking into account reform impacts. The impact of Health Reform Legislation and mandates is expected to pressure 2014 medical cost trends. Driving the increases are mandated essential health benefits and limits on out-of-pocket maximums. Consistent with recent years, our 2014 trend is expected to be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers. We expect 2014 pharmacy trends to be consistent with 2013. The primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty drugs. In recent years, the recent weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends. We believe the expected stability in the utilization trends in 2014 is influenced by our medical management strategies, our continued focus on value-based contracting arrangements and greater consumer engagement. \n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. &#32;The health care market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care for people, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. The focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. \n\nThrough expansion of our existing programs and the creation of new programs, we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2013, more than 2 million people we serve were directly aligned through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full risk, shared risk and bundled episode of care payment approaches. \n\nThis trend is also creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, providing growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. \n\nGovernment Reliance on Private Sector. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector programs. We expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible, better managed, higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs. \n\nMany states are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs. Medicaid managed care is increasingly viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs. For example, there are nearly 10 million dually eligible beneficiaries who typically have complex conditions, with costs of care that are far higher than those of a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. Similarly, a small but complex group of nearly 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTC programs represent only 6% of the total Medicaid population yet account for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The long-term care market represents a portion of the more than 15 million ABD Americans. While these individuals&#8217; health needs are more complex and more costly, \n\nthey have primarily been historically served in unmanaged environments. These markets provide UnitedHealthcare and Optum with an opportunity to work with governments to improve the health status of these populations through coordination of care. As of December 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare served more than 275,000 people in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In the first half of 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State will help implement Integrated MME program awards in three states. \n\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties \n\nFollowing is a summary of management&#8217;s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items; for additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Regulation&#8221; and Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nMedicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. &#32;Medicare Advantage payment benchmarks have been cut over the last several years, including 2013, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. Additionally, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, triggered automatic across-the-board budget cuts (known as sequestration), including a 2% reduction in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D payments beginning April 1, 2013. The CMS final notice of 2014 Medicare Advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes significant reductions to 2014 Medicare Advantage payments, including the benchmark reductions described previously. These reductions and Health Reform Legislation insurance industry tax described below result in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 4% in 2014, against a typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3%. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. Compared to 2013, and prior to any efforts to mitigate these funding reductions, we estimate that the net impact on our 2014 consolidated after-tax earnings will be approximately $0.9 billion. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans in 2014. Further, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be required to have minimum MLRs of 85%. We do not believe the minimum MLR standard will have a material impact on our earnings. CMS is expected to release the proposed 2015 Medicare Advantage Rates on February 21, 2014. We expect sustained Medicare Advantage rate pressures in 2015 due to the continuing effect of the factors described above. \n\nHealth Reform Legislation directed HHS to establish a program to reward high-quality Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2012. Accordingly, our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on a plan&#8217;s star rating. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan&#8217;s revenue. The current expanded stars bonus program that pays bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher is set to expire after 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans. For the 2014 payment year, approximately 57% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and approximately 9% are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher. For the 2015 payment year, based on scoring released by CMS in October 2013, approximately 70% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and approximately 24% are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher. \n\nThe ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we can make and are making to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase member premiums over and above the monthly payments we receive from the government, and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. The depth of the underfunding of these benefits has caused us to exit certain plans and market areas for 2014 in which we served approximately 150,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in 2013. In other markets, we may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest benefit cuts, but expect stable or growing membership in our strongest markets. We are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings to improve the performance and sustainability of our local market programs for 2016 and beyond. \n\nIn the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries increasing the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance offerings. \n\nIndustry Fees and Taxes. &#32;Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, non-deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based products, beginning January 1, 2014. The industry-wide amount of \n\nthe annual tax is $8 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual tax will be allocated to each market participant based on the ratio of the entity&#8217;s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry&#8217;s net premiums written for any U.S. health risk-based products during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. This tax will first be expensed ratably throughout 2014 and our first payment will be made in September 2014. \n\nWith the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014, Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompass: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements, $25 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2014 of which $20 billion, subject to increases based on state decisions, will fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion will fund the U.S. Treasury (Reinsurance Program). While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only non-grandfathered, market reform compliant individual business will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. \n\nWe expect our share of the industry fee to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2014. We estimate a significant increase of approximately 500 basis points in our 2014 effective income tax rate because this fee is not deductible. We estimate that the 2014 effect on earnings from operations due to our tax deductible contributions to the Reinsurance Program will be approximately $0.5 billion in 2014, payable in 2015. We do not expect material payments or receipts related to the temporary risk corridors program, permanent risk adjustment program or reinsurance recoveries in 2014. Our 2014 results of operations will include estimates related to these fees and programs. To the extent possible, we include the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing, which is expected to result in $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of additional premium in 2014. Since the industry fee will be included in operating costs, we expect our medical care ratio to decrease in 2014 compared to historical results; the industry fee cost will be factored in, however, when calculating minimum MLR rebates. \n\nExchanges and Coverage Expansion. &#32;Across markets, we and our competitors are adapting product, network and marketing strategies to anticipate new distribution or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges, private exchanges and off exchange purchasing. Effective in 2014, states may create their own public exchange, enter a partnership exchange or rely on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers, with enrollment processes that commenced in October 2013. Exchanges create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market, the pace of migration in the market and the impact of the migration on our established membership. For example, over time certain employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and some employers purchasing full risk products could convert to self-funded programs. Our level of participation in public exchanges has been and will continue to be determined on a state-by-state basis. Each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities, our current local presence, our competitive positioning, our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and members and the regulatory environment. In 2014, we are participating in 13 exchanges in 10 states and the District of Columbia, including four individual and nine SHOP exchanges. \n\nHealth Reform Legislation and related U.S. Supreme Court ruling also provide for optional expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. These measures remain subject to implementation at the state level, with varying levels of state adoption planned for January 1, 2014. We participate in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and of these, more than half have opted to expand Medicaid. \n\nIndividual &#38; Small Group Market Reforms. &#32;Health Reform Legislation includes several provisions, for most individual and small group plans with plan years beginning on January 1, 2014, that are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace, including, among other matters: (1) adjusted community rating requirements, which will change how individual and small group plans are priced in many states; (2) essential health benefit requirements, which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders; (3) actuarial value requirements, which will significantly impact benefit designs in the individual market, such as member cost sharing requirements; and (4) guaranteed issue requirements, which will require carriers to provide coverage to any qualified group or individual. These changes have resulted in significant benefit design and pricing changes for a substantial portion of the fully insured individual and small group markets. In 2014, we expect a decrease in individual membership due to a reduction in the number of states in which we will offer policies to new customers. \n\nRESULTS SUMMARY \n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Medicare Part D stand-alone membership grew by 725,000 &#32;people. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOptumRx completed the insourcing of pharmacy services for 12 million new and migrating customers served by UnitedHealthcare. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe consolidated medical care ratio of 81.5% &#32;increased 110 basis points. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, there was $1.0 billion of cash available for general corporate use and 2013 cash flows from operations were $7.0 billion . \n\n##TABLE_END 34 \n\n2013 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2012 RESULTS \n\nConsolidated Financial Results \n\nRevenues \n\nThe increases in revenues during 2013 &#32;were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions, including Amil, growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of Optum&#8217;s major businesses. The revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in Medicare Advantage rates. Also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fully-insured commercial customer from a risk-based to a fee-based arrangement affecting 1.1 million members. While this conversion reduced our full-year 2013 consolidated revenues by $2.3 billion, the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible. \n\nMedical Costs and Medical Care Ratio \n\nMedical costs during 2013 &#32;increased due to risk-based membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above. The year-over-year medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for Medicare Advantage products, changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs, and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2013 &#32;of $680 million , compared to $860 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nThe increase in our operating costs during 2013 &#32;was due to business growth, including an increase in fee-based benefits and fee-based service revenues and a greater mix of international business, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts. \n\nThe following table presents reportable segment financial information: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

The number of individuals in commercial fee-based arrangements increased due to this conversion as well as new business awards and strong customer retention. On April 1, 2013, UnitedHealthcare Military &#38; Veterans began service under the TRICARE West Region Managed Care Support Contract. This administrative services contract for health care operations added 2.9 million people and includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the government&#8217;s option. Medicare Advantage participation increased due to solid execution in product design, marketing and local engagement, which drove sales growth. Medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers, partially offset by the first quarter 2013 divestiture of our Medicaid business in South Carolina and a fourth quarter 2012 market withdrawal from one product in Wisconsin, which combined affected 235,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention in the market. International represents commercial customers in Brazil added in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the Amil acquisition, and subsequent organic growth. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s revenue growth in 2013 &#32;was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served. The effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 &#32;decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development. \n\nOptum \n\nTotal revenues increased in 2013 &#32;primarily due to broad-based growth across Optum&#8217;s services portfolio with growth in each of Optum&#8217;s major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare commercial customers and external clients. \n\nOptum&#8217;s earnings from operations and operating margin in 2013 &#32;increased significantly compared to 2012, reflecting progress on Optum&#8217;s plan to accelerate growth and improve productivity by strengthening integration and business alignment. \n\nThe results by segment were as follows: \n\nOptumHealth \n\nRevenue increases at OptumHealth in 2013 &#32;were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2012 acquisitions in local care delivery, and organic growth. \n\nEarnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 &#32;increased primarily due to revenue growth and an improved cost structure across the business, including local care delivery, population health and wellness solutions, and health-related financial services offerings. \n\nOptumInsight \n\nRevenues at OptumInsight in 2013 &#32;increased primarily due to the impact of a 2012 acquisition and growth in services to commercial payers. \n\nThe increases in earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 &#32;reflected increased revenues, changes in product mix and continuing improvements in business alignment and efficiency. \n\nOptumRx \n\nThe increase in OptumRx revenues in 2013 &#32;were due to the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare&#8217;s commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both UnitedHealthcare&#8217;s Medicare Part D members and external clients. Over the course of 2013, we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the OptumRx platform from a third party. \n\nEarnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 &#32;increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, pricing disciplines, and greater use of generic medications. \n\n2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTS \n\nC onsolidated Financial Results \n\nRevenues \n\nRevenue increases in 2012 were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our UnitedHealthcare businesses and growth in our Optum health service and technology offerings. \n\nMedical Costs \n\nMedical costs increased in 2012 due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses, unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use, partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development. Unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nThe increases in operating costs for 2012 were due to business growth, including increases in revenues from UnitedHealthcare fee-based benefits and Optum services, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, as well as investments in the OptumRx pharmacy management services and UnitedHealthcare Military &#38; Veterans businesses. \n\nIncome Tax Rate \n\nThe increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011, which lowered the 2011 effective income tax rate. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nUnitedHealthcare \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s revenue growth in 2012 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served, commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s earnings from operations for 2012 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio that was driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development. The favorable development for 2012 was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing. \n\nOptum. &#32;Total revenues increased in 2012 due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at OptumHealth, partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes. \n\nOptum&#8217;s earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification, integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products. \n\nThe results by segment were as follows: \n\nOptumHealth \n\nRevenue increases at OptumHealth for 2012 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery, and strong overall business growth. \n\nEarnings from operations for 2012 and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations. \n\nOptumInsight \n\nRevenues at OptumInsight for 2012 increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers, which was partially offset by the June 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business. \n\nThe increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management. \n\nOptumRx \n\nThe decreases in OptumRx revenues in 2012 were due to the reduction in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D plan participants. \n\nOptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the Medicare Part D business and investments to support growth initiatives, which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications. \n\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity \n\nIntroduction \n\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary&#8217;s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as &#8220;ordinary \n\ndividends&#8221; and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an &#8220;extraordinary dividend&#8221; and must receive prior regulatory approval. \n\nIn 2013, based on the 2012 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid by our U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.3 billion . In 2013 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion , including $430 million &#32;of extraordinary dividends. This level of dividends maintained our target consolidated risk-based capital level. In 2012 , our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion , including $1.2 billion &#32;of extraordinary dividends. \n\nOur non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. \n\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

(b) a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and long-term debt, as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt (in 2012, the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt primarily related to the Amil acquisition); and (c) increased net purchases of investments. \n\n2012 Cash Flows Compared to 2011 Cash Flows \n\nCash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased due to increased net income and related tax accruals, which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year in which rebate payments were made under Health Reform Legislation. \n\nOther significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) increased investments in acquisitions in 2012; (b) increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances, primarily related to the Amil acquisition; (c) increases in cash paid for customer funds related to Medicare Part D and increased shareholder dividend payments. \n\nFinancial Condition \n\nAs of December 31, 2013 , our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.3 billion &#32;included $7.3 billion &#32;of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.0 billion &#32;was available for general corporate use), $19.4 billion &#32;of debt securities and $1.6 billion &#32;of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $311 million &#32;of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. \n\nOur cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.5 years. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.6 &#32;years and a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2013 . Included in the debt securities balance was $1.4 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2013 . We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. \n\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity \n\nIn addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: \n\nCommercial Paper. &#32;We maintain a $4.0 billion commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $1.1 billion &#32;of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2% . \n\nBank Credit Facilities . &#32;We have $3.0 billion &#32;five-year and $1.0 billion &#32;364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 &#32;banks, which mature in November 2018 &#32;and November 2014 , respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2013 . The interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2013 , the annual interest rates on both bank credit facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% &#32;to 1.2% . \n\nOur bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders&#8217; equity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 34.4% &#32;as of December 31, 2013 . We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2013 . \n\nLong-term Debt. &#32;Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. \n\nIn February 2013, we issued $2.25 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $250 million of floating-rate notes due August 2014, $500 million of 1.625% fixed-rate notes due March 2019, $750 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due March 2023 and $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate notes due March 2043. \n\nIn March and April of 2013, we redeemed all of our outstanding subsidiary variable rate debt for $619 million. \n\nCredit Ratings. &#32;Our credit ratings at December 31, 2013 &#32;were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nStandard &#38; Poor&#8217;s \n\n&#160; \n\nFitch \n\n&#160; \n\nA.M.

For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. \n\nShare Repurchase Program. Under our Board of Directors&#8217; authorization, we maintain a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize our capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2013, our Board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million &#32;shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013 , we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 83 million shares of our common stock. \n\nDividends. In June 2013 , our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 &#32;per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2012 , we had paid an annual cash dividend of $0.85 &#32;per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. \n\nAmil Tender Offer. &#32;We acquired all of Amil&#8217;s remaining public shares for $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2013, bringing our ownership in Amil to 90%. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \n\nThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2013, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2015 to 2016 \n\n&#160; \n\n2017 to 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nDebt (a) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,644 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,450 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,411 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,147 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,652 \n\nOperating leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,403 \n\nPurchase obligations (b) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nFuture policy benefits (c) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,940 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,601 \n\nUnrecognized tax benefits (d) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,482 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,711 \n\nOther obligations (f) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests (g) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,175 \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,851 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,996 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,276 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,203 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n36,326 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (a) \n\nIncludes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. For variable rate debt, the rates in effect at December 31, 2013 were used to calculate the interest coupon payments. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for more detail. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (b) \n\nIncludes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013. \n\n##TABLE_END 41 \n\n##TABLE_START (c) \n\nFuture policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for more detail. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (d) \n\nAs the timing of future settlements is uncertain, they have been classified as due &#8220;Thereafter.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (e) \n\nIncludes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as &#8220;Thereafter.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (f) \n\nIncludes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (g) \n\nIncludes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries, primarily the shares owned by Amil&#8217;s remaining non-public shareholders. \n\n##TABLE_END We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. \n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nWe have determined that there have been no recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nMedical Costs Payable \n\nEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2013, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. \n\nEach period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2013, 2012, and 2011 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $680 million , $860 million &#32;and $720 million , respectively. \n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated \n\nby us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. \n\nCompletion factors. &#32;Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2013: &#160; ##TABLE_START Completion Factors \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nIn Medical Costs Payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n(0.75)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.50) \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.25) \n\n&#160; \n\n0.25 \n\n&#160; \n\n(96 \n\n) \n\n0.50 \n\n&#160; \n\n(192 \n\n) \n\n0.75 \n\n&#160; \n\n(287 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMedical cost PMPM trend factors. &#32;Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2013: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Medical Costs PMPM Trend \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) \n\nIn Medical Costs Payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n3% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2 \n\n&#160; \n\n1 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1) \n\n&#160; \n\n(191 \n\n) \n\n(2) \n\n&#160; \n\n(382 \n\n) \n\n(3) \n\n&#160; \n\n(573 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \n\nOur estimate of medical costs payable represents management&#8217;s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2013, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2013; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2013 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare \n\nSupplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2013 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $65 million. \n\nRevenues \n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. \n\nOur Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS&#8217; risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS&#8217; retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information regarding these audits. Additionally, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be subject to a minimum MLR threshold of 85%. We will include in our estimates of premiums to be recognized the expected premium minimum MLR rebates, if any. \n\nU.S. commercial health plans with MLRs on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for \n\nindividuals) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. \n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. \n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. \n\nForecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRevenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMedical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the &#8220;Medical Cost Trend&#8221; section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the &#8220;Medical Costs Payable&#8221; critical accounting estimate above. \n\n##TABLE_END 44 \n\nSimilar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOperating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nCapital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered. \n\n##TABLE_END Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, &#8220;Business - Government Regulation.&#8221; For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I and &#8220;Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties&#8221; above. \n\nDiscount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. \n\nThe passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units&#8217; operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. \n\nWe elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2014. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. \n\nIntangible assets. &#32;Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). These intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 73% &#32;of our total intangible asset balance of $3.8 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2013. \n\nCustomer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rates, perpetuity growth rates and discount rates. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested). \n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset&#8217;s (or asset group&#8217;s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. \n\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2013. \n\nInvestments \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, we had investments with a carrying value of $21.5 billion , primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders&#8217; equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2013, our available-for-sale investments had gross unrealized gains of $326 million &#32;and gross unrealized losses of $234 million . \n\nFor debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, and recognized in net earnings, and all other causes, and recognized in other comprehensive income. \n\nFor equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security&#8217;s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. \n\nThe most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment. \n\nFair values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nprices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, our custodian, our investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nchanges in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. \n\nOther-than-temporary impairment assessment. &#32; Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change. \n\nThe unrealized losses of $234 million &#32;and $9 million &#32;at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $8 million , $6 million &#32;and $12 million , respectively. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; as of December 31, 2013. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. \n\nThe judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. \n\nAs discussed further in Item 7A &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; a 1% increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $756 million . \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \n\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions&#8217; tax court systems. \n\nThe significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2013 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $89 million. \n\nContingent Liabilities \n\nBecause of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. \n\nEstimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. \n\nGiven this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. \n\nLEGAL MATTERS \n\nA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK \n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and \n\nother customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2013 , we had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as &#8220;A+.&#8221; As of December 31, 2013 , there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. \n\n"}
