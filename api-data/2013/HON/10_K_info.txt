All references to Notes related to Notes to the Financial Statements in &#147;Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148;. \n\nThe Consumer Products Group (CPG) automotive aftermarket business had historically been part of the Transportation Systems reportable segment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, CPG results are excluded from continuing operations and are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nFor Honeywell, 2013 marked another year of growth and enhanced profitability. Despite a modest 2.5 percent growth in World GDP and Industrial Production, Honeywell&#146;s 2013 revenues were $39.1 billion representing a 4 percent improvement compared to 2012 revenues of $37.7 billion. Our segment profit improved by 8 percent, roughly two times revenue growth, evidencing the Company&#146;s continued focus on operational excellence. We achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on proactive repositioning. See Review of Business Segments section of this MD&#38;A for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes. \n\nThe Company&#146;s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. Honeywell refers to these processes as the Honeywell Enablers. In 2013, Honeywell continued to strengthen and expand the use of the Honeywell Enablers: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; The Honeywell Operating System (&#147;HOS&#148;): HOS drives sustainable improvements in our manufacturing operations to generate exceptional performance in safety, quality, delivery, cost, and inventory management. Approximately 75 percent of our manufacturing cost base has achieved HOS certification. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Velocity Product Development (&#147;VPD&#148;): VPD is a process which brings together all of the functions necessary to successfully launch new products&#151;R&#38;D, manufacturing, marketing and sales&#151;to increase the probability that in commercializing new technologies Honeywell delivers the right products at the right price. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Functional Transformation (&#147;FT&#148;): Functional Transformation is HOS for our administrative functions&#151;Finance, Legal, HR, IT and Purchasing&#151;standardizing the way we work, which improves service quality and reduces costs. \n\n##TABLE_END The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; R&#38;D spending at 4.6 percent of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, and voice control and wireless control devices and technologies. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures grew 7 percent to $947 million principally related to the construction and expansion of Performance Materials and Technologies manufacturing facilities, as well as upgrades to our Aerospace facilities. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; The Company recognized approximately $231 million of charges relating to restructuring actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come. \n\n##TABLE_END 27 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; The Company completed $1,133 million (net of cash acquired) in acquisitions in 2013, including the acquisition of Intermec, Inc. (&#147;Intermec&#148;), a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions (RFID) and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments and RAE Systems, Inc. (RAE), a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems, and software. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; The Company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses and to divest those that do not fit within our long-term strategic plan. In January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Friction Materials business for approximately $155 million. \n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Expansion of Honeywell&#146;s presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle-East, and Latin America. Sales to customers outside the United States now account for approximately 55 percent of total revenues. \n\n##TABLE_END Operating cash flow grew by 23 percent in 2013 to $4,335 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $947 million in capital expenditures, partially fund the acquisitions discussed above, make $156 million in non-U.S. pension contributions, provide a 10 percent increase in the Company&#146;s cash dividend rate (vs. 2012) and repurchase 13.5 million shares of common stock. \n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nNet Sales \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

These securities (B/E Aerospace common stock), designated as available for sale, were obtained in conjunction with the sale of the \n\nConsumables Solutions business in July 2008. This gain was partially offset by an increase in loss on sale of non-strategic businesses and assets of $25 million, primarily due to a pre-tax loss of approximately $28 million related to the pending divestiture of the Friction Materials business within our Transportation Systems segment. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures for further details. \n\nOther income decreased by $14 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a $50 million pre-tax gain related to the divestiture of the automotive on-board sensors products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2011, partially offset by a loss of $29 million resulting from early redemption of debt in 2011 included within &#147;Other, net&#148; and the reduction of approximately $6 million of acquisition related costs compared to 2011 included within &#147;Other, net&#148;. \n\nInterest and Other Financial Charges \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; 2012 \n\n&#160; 2011 \n\nInterest and other financial charges \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; % change compared with prior period \n\n&#160; (7)% \n\n&#160; (7)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END Interest and other financial charges decreased by 7 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher average debt balances. \n\nInterest and other financial charges decreased by 7 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower borrowing costs, partially offset by higher average debt balances. \n\nTax Expense \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; 2012 \n\n&#160; 2011 \n\nTax expense \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,450 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Effective tax rate \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 26.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 24.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 18.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END The effective tax rate increased by 2.4 percentage points in 2013 compared with 2012. The year over year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to lower mark-to-market pension expense in the U.S. Other factors causing an increase in the effective tax rate include higher tax expense related to an increase in tax reserves and higher state tax expense. These increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by tax benefits from retroactive law changes in the U.S. The Company&#146;s foreign effective tax rate for 2013 was 19.0 percent, an increase of approximately 2.0 percentage points compared to 2012. The year over year increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher expense related to retroactive tax law changes in Germany and additional reserves in various jurisdictions, coupled with higher earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. \n\nThe effective tax rate increased by 6.1 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings taxed at higher rates (primarily driven by an approximate 6.1 percentage point impact from the decrease in pension mark-to-market expense), a decreased benefit from valuation allowances, a decreased benefit from the settlement of tax audits and the absence of the U.S. R&#38;D tax credit, partially offset by a decreased expense related to tax reserves. The foreign effective tax rate was 17.0 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.1 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 10.0 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves, partially offset by a 5.2 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in Luxembourg and France earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 1.4 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. \n\nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013. Some of these provisions provided retroactive changes to the 2012 tax year which were not taken into account in determining the Company&#146;s effective tax rate for 2012. The impact of these retroactive changes was approximately $76 million of lower tax expense and was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. \n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; 2012 \n\n&#160; 2011 \n\nAmounts attributable to Honeywell \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome from continuing operations \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,924 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,926 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,858 \n\n&#160; Income from discontinued operations \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 209 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to Honeywell \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,924 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,926 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,067 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings per share of common stock&#151;assuming dilution \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome from continuing operations \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4.92 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3.69 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2.35 \n\n&#160; Income from discontinued operations \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 0.26 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to Honeywell \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4.92 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3.69 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2.61 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END Earnings per share of common stock&#151;assuming dilution increased by $1.23 per share in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower pension expense (mainly due to a decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment), increased segment profit in each of our business segments and higher other income as discussed above, partially offset by increased tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges. \n\nEarnings per share of common stock&#151;assuming dilution increased by $1.08 per share in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower pension expense (mainly due to a decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment), increased segment profit in our Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments, lower repositioning and other charges, partially offset by increased tax expense, decreased income from discontinued operations and higher other postretirement expense. \n\nFor further discussion of segment results, see &#147;Review of Business Segments.&#148; \n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW \n\nThis Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2014 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segment&#146;s results for the three years ended December 31, 2013.

\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional OE sales increased by 7 percent in 2013 driven by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OE Manufacturers&#146; (OEM) higher production rates, partially offset by lower regional jet sales. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 3 percent in 2013 driven by an increase in OEM Payments to business and general aviation customers, partially offset by strong demand in the business jet mid to large cabin segment. \n\n##TABLE_END Commercial aftermarket sales increased by 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional aftermarket sales were flat for 2013 primarily due to higher repair and overhaul activities related to utilization, offset by lower spares volumes. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 6 percent in 2013 primarily due to higher sales for retrofit, modifications and upgrades, partially offset by fewer repair and overhaul activities. \n\n##TABLE_END Defense and space sales decreased by 5 percent in 2013 primarily due to U.S. government program ramp downs and lower defense budget, partially offset by a royalty gain in the fourth quarter. \n\nAerospace segment profit increased by 4 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit driven by commercial sales growth, as discussed above, including favorable pricing and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by lower defense and space sales, as discussed above. The segment margin impact from other factors was flat, which reflects the net effect of a royalty gain in the fourth quarter, offset by the unfavorable impact from an increase in OEM Payments. Cost of products and services sold totaled $8.8 billion in 2013, a decrease of approximately $101 million from 2012 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above (excluding price). \n\n2012 compared with 2011 \n\nAerospace sales increased by 5 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in organic growth of 3 percent primarily due to increased commercial sales volume, a 1 percent increase from acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a 1 percent increase in revenue related to an $88 million reduction in payments to business and general aviation OE manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms (OEM Payments). \n\nDetails regarding the changes in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: \n\nCommercial original equipment (OE) sales increased by 19 percent (12 percent organic) in 2012 compared to 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional OE sales increased by 11 percent (11 percent organic) in 2012 primarily driven by higher sales to our OE customers, consistent with higher production rates, and a favorable platform mix. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 34 percent (15 percent organic) in 2012 driven by strong demand in the business jet end-market, favorable platform mix, growth from acquisitions and the favorable 12 percent impact of the OEM Payments discussed above. \n\n##TABLE_END Commercial aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2012 compared to 2011. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent for 2012 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts and higher maintenance activity driven by an approximate 2 percent increase in global flying hours in 2012, increased sales of avionics upgrades, and changes in customer buying patterns relating to maintenance activity in the first half of 2012. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 17 percent in 2012 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts and revenue associated with maintenance service agreements and a higher penetration in retrofit, modifications, and upgrades. \n\n##TABLE_END 36 \n\nDefense and space sales decreased by 3 percent (negative 4 percent organic) in 2012 primarily due to anticipated program ramp downs, partially offset by higher international aftermarket sales and growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures. \n\nAerospace segment profit increased by 13 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 8 percent, a 4 percent favorable impact from lower OEM Payments, discussed above, and a 1 percent increase from acquisitions, net of divestitures. The increase in operational segment profit is due to the favorable impact from higher price and productivity, net of inflation, and commercial demand partially offset by increased research, development and engineering investments. Cost of products and services sold totaled $9.0 billion in 2012, an increase of approximately $324 million from 2011 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above (excluding price). \n\n2014 Areas of Focus \n\nAerospace&#146;s primary areas of focus for 2014 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Global pursuit of new commercial, defense and space programs; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Driving customer satisfaction through operational excellence (product quality, cycle time reduction, and supplier management); \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Aligning research and development and customer support costs with customer requirements and demand for new platforms with high marketplace appeal; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Expanding sales and operations in international locations; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Focusing on cost structure initiatives to maintain profitability in face of economic uncertainty and potential defense and space budget reductions and program specific appropriations; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Continuing to design equipment that enhances the safety, performance and durability of aerospace and defense equipment, while reducing weight and operating costs; and \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Continued deployment and optimization of our common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. \n\n##TABLE_END Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) \n\nOverview \n\nACS provides innovative products and solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable.

We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; 2012 \n\n&#160; 2011 \n\nCash provided by (used for): \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4,335 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,517 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,833 \n\n&#160; Investing activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1,959 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1,428 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (611 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancing activities \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (433 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1,206 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (1,114 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (155 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 53 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (60 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,788 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,048 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END 2013 compared with 2012 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $818 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to (i) reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $883 million, (ii) a $447 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (iii) a $135 million favorable impact from working capital (driven by improved accounts payable performance and inventory, partially offset by higher receivables primarily due to sales growth and timing of sales), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $352 million and a $260 million increase in net payments for repositioning and other charges (most significantly the NARCO Trust establishment payments of $164 million). \n\nCash used for investing activities increased by $531 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $695 million (most significantly Intermec and RAE), partially offset by an increase of approximately $190 million in settlement receipts of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. \n\nCash used for financing activities decreased by $773 million during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,462 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $651 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $142 million. \n\n2012 compared with 2011 \n\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $684 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $706 million and a $342 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $340 million. \n\nCash used for investing activities increased by $817 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to (i) a decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses of $1,135 million (most significantly the divestiture of the Consumer Products Group business and the automotive on-board sensor products business within our Automation and Control Solutions segment in 2011), (ii) a net $117 million increase in investments (primarily short-term marketable securities), and (iii) an increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $86 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $535 million. \n\nCash used for financing activities increased by $92 million during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $825 million and an increase in dividends paid of $120 million, partially offset by a decrease of $806 million in net repurchases of common stock and a decrease of $33 million in the payment of debt assumed with acquisitions. \n\nLiquidity \n\nEach of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, the Company believes that cash balances and operating cash flows are the principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets, as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivables. At December 31, 2013, a substantial portion of the Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. \n\nGlobal economic conditions or a tightening of credit markets could adversely affect our customers&#146; or suppliers&#146; ability to obtain financing, particularly in our long-cycle businesses and airline, automotive and refining/petrochemical end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. To date we have not experienced material impacts from customer or supplier bankruptcy or liquidity issues. We continue to monitor and take measures to limit our exposure. \n\nA source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. There was $1,299 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013. \n\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2013, Standard and Poor&#146;s (S&#38;P), Fitch, and Moody&#146;s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively, and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1 respectively. S&#38;P, Fitch and Moody&#146;s have Honeywell&#146;s rating outlook as &#147;stable&#148;. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n\nAs a source of liquidity, we sell interests in designated pools of trade accounts receivables to third parties. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, none of the receivables in the designated pools had been sold to third parties. When we sell receivables, they are over-collateralized and we retain a subordinated interest in the pool of receivables representing that over-collateralization as well as an undivided interest in the balance of the receivables pools. The terms of the trade accounts receivable \n\nprogram permit the repurchase of receivables from the third parties at our discretion, providing us with an additional source of revolving credit. As a result, program receivables remain on the Company&#146;s balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as Short-term borrowings. \n\nIn March 2013, the Company repaid $600 million of its 4.25 percent notes. \n\nIn November 2013, the Company issued $300 million 3.35 percent Senior Notes due 2023 and $700 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2015 (collectively, the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Honeywell and rank equally with all of Honeywell&#146;s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of Honeywell&#146;s subordinated debt. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1 billion, offset by $7 million in discount and closing costs related to the offering. \n\nOn December 10, 2013, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (&#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The Credit Agreement contains a $700 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes and amends and restates the previous $3 billion five year credit agreement dated April 2, 2012 (&#147;Prior Agreement&#148;). There have been no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Prior Agreement. \n\nDuring 2013, the Company repurchased $1,073 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans (see Part II, Item 5 for share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2013). In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock. \n\nOn June 3, 2013, the Company acquired RAE, a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems, and software. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was $338 million. The acquisition was funded with available cash. See Acquisitions in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. \n\nOn September 17, 2013, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Intermec, a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments. Intermec was a U.S. public company that operated globally and had reported 2012 revenues of $790 million. The aggregate value, net of cash acquired, was $607 million. The acquisition was funded with the issuance of commercial paper. See Acquisitions in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. \n\nIn January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Friction Materials business to Federal Mogul Corporation for approximately $155 million. The transaction, subject to required regulatory approvals and applicable information and consultation requirements, is expected to close in the second half of 2014. See Divestitures in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. \n\nIn 2013, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. During 2013, cash contributions of $156 million were made to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. \n\nThe NARCO Plan of Reorganization went into effect on April 30, 2013. In 2013, the Company made NARCO Trust establishment payments of $164 million. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2014 related to the NARCO Trust. \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments. \n\nSpecifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2014 to be as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Capital expenditures&#151;we expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures in 2014 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Share repurchases&#151;under the Company&#146;s share repurchase program, $5 billion is available as of December 31, 2013 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Dividends&#151;we increased our dividend rate by 10 percent to $.45 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2013 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2014. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Asbestos claims&#151;we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $459 and $76 million, respectively, in 2014. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for further discussion of possible funding obligations in 2014 related to the NARCO Trust. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Pension contributions&#151;in 2014, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Repositioning actions&#151;we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2014. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Environmental remediation costs&#151;we expect to spend approximately $300 million in 2014 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs. See Environmental Matters in Note 22 to the financial statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2013 and 2012, we realized $3 and $21 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets as well as our ability to sell trade accounts receivables, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. \n\nContractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2013: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Total(6) \n\n&#160; Payments by Period \n\n&#160; Thereafter \n\n&#160; 2014 \n\n&#160; 2015- 2016 \n\n&#160; 2017- 2018 \n\nLong-term debt, including capitalized leases(1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n7,433 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,328 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n1,343 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n4,130 \n\n&#160; Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 3,664 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 315 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 591 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 494 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2,264 \n\n&#160; Minimum operating lease payments \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,244 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 313 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 440 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 227 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 264 \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations(2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,626 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 796 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 502 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 248 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 80 \n\n&#160; Estimated environmental liability payments(3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 643 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 304 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 230 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 80 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 29 \n\n&#160; Asbestos related liability payments(4) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 1,611 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 461 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 630 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 401 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 119 \n\n&#160; Asbestos insurance recoveries(5) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (672 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (77 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (140 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (148 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; (307 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n15,549 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,744 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n3,581 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n2,645 \n\n&#160; &#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n6,579 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n&#160;\n\n(2) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n&#160;\n\n(3) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2013. See Environmental Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n&#160;\n\n(4) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2013. We have accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 until April 2013 when the NARCO Plan of Reorganization became fully effective, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause asbestos liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n&#160;\n\n(5) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2013. The timing of insurance recoveries are impacted by the terms of insurance settlement agreements, as well as the documentation, review and collection process required to collect on insurance claims. Where probable insurance recoveries are not subject to definitive settlement agreements with specified payment dates, but instead are covered by insurance policies, we have assumed collection will occur beyond 2018. Projecting the timing of insurance recoveries is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the amounts collected to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded or could cause the timing of collections to be earlier or later than that projected. We reevaluate our projections concerning insurance recoveries in light of any changes or developments that would impact recoveries or the timing thereof. See Asbestos Matters in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n&#160;\n\n(6) \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; The table excludes tax effects as well as $729 million of uncertain tax positions. See Note 6 Income Taxes of Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_END The table also excludes our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations. In 2014, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans, however, we plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Beyond 2014, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying \n\nasset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. We expect our OPEB payments to approximate $130 million in 2014 net of the benefit of approximately $11 million from the Medicare prescription subsidy. See Note 23 to the financial statements for further discussion of our pension and OPEB plans. \n\nThe noncontrolling interest shareholder of UOP Russell LLC (formerly Thomas Russell Co.), one of our subsidiaries, has put rights that may be exercised causing us to purchase their equity interests beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The same interest is subject to certain call rights by the Company. As the amount paid is based on operating income performance from 2013 to 2015, the actual settlement amount may be different and has therefore been excluded from this table. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nFollowing is a summary of our off-balance sheet arrangements: \n\nGuarantees &#151;We have issued or are a party to the following direct and indirect guarantees at December 31, 2013: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Maximum Potential Future Payments \n\nOperating lease residual values \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Other third parties&#146; financing \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 5 \n\n&#160; Customer financing \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\nIn connection with the disposition of certain businesses and facilities we have indemnified the purchasers for the expected cost of remediation of environmental contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. Such expected costs are accrued when environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. \n\nWith respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly, with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy (see Note 1 to the financial statements) to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the \n\nrange of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. \n\nRemedial response and voluntary cleanup costs charged against pretax earnings were $272, $234 and $240 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the recorded liabilities for environmental matters was $643 and $654 million, respectively. In addition, in 2013 and 2012 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 and $84 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nRemedial response and voluntary cleanup payments were $304, $320 and $270 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are currently estimated to be approximately $300 million in 2014. We expect to fund such expenditures from operating cash flow. \n\nAlthough we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they could be material to our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. \n\nSee Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, including those related to environmental matters and toxic tort litigation. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nAs a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. A summary of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements. We also hold investments in marketable equity securities, which exposes us to market volatility, as discussed in Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements. \n\nWe conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency forward and option agreements with third parties. Our principal currency exposures relate to the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won, Singapore Dollar, Swiss Franc, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Swedish Krona, Thai Baht and Romanian Leu. \n\nOur exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our net debt and pension obligations. As described in Note 14 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements, we issue both fixed and variable rate debt and use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and reduce overall borrowing costs. \n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and \n\ncommodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and expected future cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one-percentage-point increase in interest rates across all maturities, the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities, and the potential change in fair value of contracts hedging commodity purchases based on a 20 percent decrease in the price of the underlying commodity across all maturities at December 31, 2013 and 2012. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nWe have discussed the selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Independent Registered Public Accountants. New accounting standards effective in 2013 which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements are described in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the Financial Statements. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#151;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. For a discussion of our contingencies related to environmental, asbestos and other matters, including management&#146;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, see Notes 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. \n\nAsbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries &#151;We are a defendant in personal injury actions related to products containing asbestos (refractory and friction products). We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust through 2018 as described in Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. We will continue to update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of pending and future Bendix claims during the fourth quarter each year. For additional information see Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential ranges of \n\nprobable losses and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Our insurance is with both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#146;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#151;We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. \n\nWe recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans&#146; projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment) and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. This accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $51, $957 and $1,802 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The remaining components of pension income/expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense). \n\nFor financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension income/expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 23 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to the Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. Information on all our significant actuarial assumptions is included in Note 23 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to the Financial Statements. \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our 2013, 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 2013 \n\n&#160; 2012 \n\n&#160; 2011 \n\nDiscount rate \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.06 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 4.89 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 5.25 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 7.75 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nActual rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 23 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 13 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n&#160; Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; 6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.89 percent discount rate in 2014, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since December 31, 2012. We plan to continue to \n\nuse an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75 percent for 2014 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations on future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan&#146;s investments. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in Assumption \n\n&#160; Impact on 2014 Pension Ongoing Expense \n\n&#160; Impact on PBO \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate \n\n&#160; Decrease $4 million \n\n&#160; Increase $529 million \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate \n\n&#160; Increase $3 million \n\n&#160; Decrease $512 million \n\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Increase $40 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets \n\n&#160; Decrease $40 million \n\n&#160; &#151; \n\n##TABLE_END Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $230 million in 2014 compared with pension ongoing income of $90 million in 2013. The increase in pension ongoing income in 2014 compared with 2013 results primarily from an increase in the plans&#146; assets at December 31, 2013 compared with December 31, 2012 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2013. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2014, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nIn 2013, 2012 and 2011, we were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans and did not make a contribution to our U.S. plans during 2013. However, we made voluntary contributions of $792 and $1,650 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status of our plans which had been adversely impacted by relatively low discount rates and asset losses in 2011 and 2008 resulting from the poor performance of the equity markets. In 2014, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $150 million ($117 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2014) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non- U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. \n\nLong-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) &#151;To conduct our global business operations and execute our business strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2013, the net carrying amount of these long-lived assets totaled approximately $7.1 billion. The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not these assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n##TABLE_END 55 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Significant negative industry or economic trends; or \n\n&#160;\n\n&#149; \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n&#160; Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\n##TABLE_END Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. As described in more detail in Note 16 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to the Financial Statements, we have recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $72 million in 2013, principally related to property, plant and equipment and $22 million and 2012, principally related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing &#151;Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances of $13.0 billion and $725 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013, are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing goodwill, the fair value of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. This impairment test involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. \n\nWe completed our annual impairment test as of March 31, 2013 and determined that there was no impairment to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of that date. However, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair values in the future. \n\nIncome Taxes &#151;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions. \n\nAs of December 31, 2013, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $1,004 million that is comprised of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. We maintain a valuation allowance of $614 million to offset a portion of this non-U.S. net deferred tax asset. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our \n\nvolume, pricing and costs. Additionally, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws. \n\nOur net deferred tax asset of $1,004 million consists of $19 million related to U.S. operations and $985 million related to non-U.S. operations. The U.S. net deferred tax asset of $19 million consists of federal and state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards reduced by net taxable temporary differences. The non-U.S. net deferred tax asset of $985 million consists principally of net deductible temporary differences, net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, (mainly in Canada, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). We maintain a valuation allowance of $614 million against a portion of the non-US net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance maintained against these deferred tax assets reflects our historical experience and lower expectations of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods. As more fully described in Note 6 to the financial statements, our valuation allowance increased by $16 million in 2013, increased by $7 million in 2012 and decreased by $45 million in 2011. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a credit to income in the period that such determination is made. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#151;In 2013, we recognized approximately 16 percent of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments. These long- term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 22 to the financial statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n"}
