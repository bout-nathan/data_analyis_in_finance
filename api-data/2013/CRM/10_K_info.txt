MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled &#147;Forward-Looking Information&#148; and &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or &#147;cloud.&#148; We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. \n\nOur mission is to help our customers transform themselves into &#147;customer companies&#148; by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core services&#151;Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform&#151;customers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; strengthening our market-leading solutions; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; extending distribution into high-growth markets; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; expanding relationships with our existing customer base; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; pursuing new customers; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; reducing our attrition rates; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; building our business in top markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help us add customers; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. \n\n##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers&#146; willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers&#146; willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers&#146; ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers&#146; purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. \n\nTo address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. \n\nWe also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis. \n\nOur typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts are available for renewal. We calculate our attrition rates as of the end of each reporting period. We do not calculate the attrition rate for ExactTarget, Inc. (&#147;ExactTarget&#148;). Our attrition rate was in the high-single digit percentage range as of January 31, 2014, declining from the low-double digit percentage range attrition rate as of January 31, 2013. We expect our attrition rates to continue to decline slowly over time, as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and other related programs. \n\nThe majority of our subscription and support revenues are derived from subscriptions to our Sales Cloud. \n\nWe expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 and 53 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying customers, and build greater brand awareness. \n\nOn March 18, 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the debt, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. The note hedge transactions are designed, but not guaranteed, to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion. \n\nOn March 20, 2013, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0 million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four-for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April 3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April 17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate. \n\nIn June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. \n\nOn July 11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a $300.0 million term loan due on July 11, 2016. All amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for ExactTarget. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements On July 12, 2013, we acquired for cash the outstanding stock of ExactTarget, a leading global provider of cross-channel, digital marketing solutions. We acquired ExactTarget for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and to create a world-class marketing platform across the channels of email, social, mobile and the web. The financial results of ExactTarget are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for ExactTarget was approximately $2.6 billion. \n\nFiscal Year \n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. \n\nSources of Revenues \n\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. &#147;Other revenue&#148; consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a &#147;customer&#148; as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a &#147;subscription&#148; as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a &#147;subscriber.&#148; The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. \n\nSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. \n\nProfessional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. \n\nIn determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in &#147;Critical Accounting Estimates&#151;Revenue Recognition&#148; below. \n\nSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable \n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. Year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Approximately 74 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2014. \n\nAccordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (in thousands) &#160; April 30, 2013 &#160; &#160; July 31, 2013 &#160; &#160; October 31, 2013 &#160; &#160; January 31, 2014 &#160; Fiscal 2014 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; $ 502,609 &#160; &#160; $ 599,543 &#160; &#160; $ 604,045 &#160; &#160; $ 1,360,837 &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,733,160 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,789,648 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,734,619 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,522,115 &#160; (in thousands) &#160; April 30, 2012 &#160; &#160; July 31, 2012 &#160; &#160; October 31, 2012 &#160; &#160; January 31, 2013 &#160; Fiscal 2013 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; $ 371,395 &#160; &#160; $ 446,917 &#160; &#160; $ 418,590 &#160; &#160; $ 872,634 &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,334,716 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,337,184 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,291,703 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,862,995 &#160; (in thousands) &#160; April 30, 2011 &#160; &#160; July 31, 2011 &#160; &#160; October 31, 2011 &#160; &#160; January 31, 2012 &#160; Fiscal 2012 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; $ 270,816 &#160; &#160; $ 342,397 &#160; &#160; $ 312,331 &#160; &#160; $ 683,745 &#160; Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent \n\n&#160; &#160; 915,133 &#160; &#160; &#160; 935,266 &#160; &#160; &#160; 917,821 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,380,295 &#160; ##TABLE_END Unbilled Deferred Revenue \n\nThe deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014 and approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013. Also as a result, our typical contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses \n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. \n\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. \n\nResearch and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. \n\nWe expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. \n\nMarketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. \n\nWe plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. \n\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. \n\nDuring fiscal 2014, we recognized stock-based expense of $503.3 million. As of January 31, 2014, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years was $1.4 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $596.3 million during fiscal 2015; $425.9 million during fiscal 2016; $251.0 million during fiscal 2017 and $100.2 million during fiscal 2018. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2014 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. \n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#146;s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 &#147;Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies&#148; to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRevenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. &#147;Other revenue&#148; consists primarily of training fees. \n\nWe commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the service has been or is being provided to the customer; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. \n\n##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. \n\nSubscription and Support Revenues \n\nSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements Professional Services and Other Revenues \n\nThe majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. \n\nMultiple-Deliverable Arrangements \n\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer&#146;s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. \n\nMultiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (&#147;VSOE&#148;), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (&#147;BESP&#148;), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (&#147;TPE&#148;) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. \n\nFor certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. \n\nWe determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. \n\nDeferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. \n\nDeferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. \n\nDeferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer&#146;s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. \n\nDuring fiscal 2014, we deferred $265.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $194.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $324.9 million at January 31, 2014 and $254.4 million at January 31, 2013. \n\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets . We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. \n\nThe value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. \n\nWe evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. \n\nBusiness Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. \n\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the acquired company&#146;s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; discount rates. \n\n##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \n\nStock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;). The fair value of each option or ESPP share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights; and \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; The probability of performance conditions that effect the vesting of certain awards being achieved. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest. \n\n##TABLE_END Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. \n\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. \n\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. \n\nOur tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the United States and many countries in the European Union, changes in accounting principles, adverse results of tax examinations as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders&#146; equity. \n\nStrategic Investments . We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Subscription and support revenues were $3.8 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $955.7 million, or 33 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to a year ago. We have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped reduce our attrition rates. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. The net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.1 million, or 36 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,171.2 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $244.7 million, or 26 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our service internationally and reduced attrition rates. However, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies caused a decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of decreasing our aggregate revenues by $24.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. \n\nCost of Revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Subscription and support \n\n&#160; $ 711,880 &#160; &#160; $ 494,187 &#160; &#160; $ 217,693 &#160; Professional services and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 256,548 &#160; &#160; &#160; 189,392 &#160; &#160; &#160; 67,156 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total cost of revenues \n\n&#160; $ 968,428 &#160; &#160; $ 683,579 &#160; &#160; $ 284,849 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $968.4 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $683.6 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $284.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $102.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $48.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $80.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $32.1 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology, an increase of $16.1 million in subcontractor and professional services expense, an increase of $23.1 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $11.9 million in stock-based expenses. We have increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since January 31, 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which the majority was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to cost of revenues which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. \n\nResearch and Development. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 623,798 &#160; &#160; $ 429,479 &#160; &#160; $ 194,319 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $623.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $429.5 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $194.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $114.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $31.1 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $16.0 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $17.2 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $14.8 million in test data lab costs. We increased our research and development headcount by 31 percent since January 31, 2013 in \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget.

A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to research and development which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. \n\nMarketing and Sales. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Marketing and sales \n\n&#160; $ 2,168,132 &#160; &#160; $ 1,614,026 &#160; &#160; $ 554,106 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 53 % &#160; &#160; 53 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $2.2 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $1.6 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $554.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $357.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $57.2 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and an increase of $49.8 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 33 percent since January 31, 2013. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, while a portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. \n\nGeneral and Administrative. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; General and administrative \n\n&#160; $ 596,719 &#160; &#160; $ 433,821 &#160; &#160; $ 162,898 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; ##TABLE_END General and administrative expenses were $596.7 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $433.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $162.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $21.7 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $48.3 million in professional and outside services, which included transaction fees associated with the ExactTarget acquisition, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 28 percent since January 31, 2013 as we added personnel to support our growth. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. \n\nLoss from operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Loss from operations \n\n&#160; $ (286,074 ) &#160; $ (110,710 ) &#160; $ (175,364 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (7 )% &#160; &#160; (4 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Loss from operations for fiscal 2014, was $286.1 million and included $503.3 million of stock-based expenses and $146.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles.

Investment income was $10.2 million for fiscal 2014, and was $19.6 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities balances. \n\nInterest expense. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (77,211 ) &#160; $ (30,948 ) &#160; $ (46,263 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (2 )% &#160; &#160; (1 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, term loan and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $77.2 million for fiscal 2014 and was $30.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the March 2013 issuance of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes, the $300.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in June 2013. \n\nBenefit from (provision for) Income Taxes. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; Benefit from (provision for) income taxes \n\n&#160; $ 125,760 &#160; &#160; $ (142,651 ) &#160; $ 268,411 &#160; Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; 35 % &#160; &#160; (112 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END We reported a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in the previous year and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. \n\nWe recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. \n\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. \n\nRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $200.2 million, or 28 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to fiscal 2012. \n\nCost of Revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Subscription and support \n\n&#160; $ 494,187 &#160; &#160; $ 360,758 &#160; &#160; $ 133,429 &#160; Professional services and other \n\n&#160; &#160; 189,392 &#160; &#160; &#160; 128,128 &#160; &#160; &#160; 61,264 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Total cost of revenues \n\n&#160; $ 683,579 &#160; &#160; $ 488,886 &#160; &#160; $ 194,693 &#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $683.6 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $488.9 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $194.7 million. The increase \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $77.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $16.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $36.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $37.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $17.2 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets and an increase of $14.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased customer support and professional services headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2012 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. \n\nResearch and Development. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 429,479 &#160; &#160; $ 295,347 &#160; &#160; $ 134,132 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 13 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $429.5 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013, compared to $295.3 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $134.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $92.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.4 million in stock-based expenses and an increase of $8.8 million in our development and test data center. We increased our research and development headcount by 36 percent since January 31, 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. \n\nMarketing and Sales. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Marketing and sales \n\n&#160; $ 1,614,026 &#160; &#160; $ 1,169,610 &#160; &#160; $ 444,416 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 53 % &#160; &#160; 52 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $1.6 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $1.2 billion, or 52 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $444.4 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $305.9 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $83.6 million in stock-based expenses, $29.3 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and $23.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. \n\nGeneral and Administrative. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; General and administrative \n\n&#160; $ 433,821 &#160; &#160; $ 347,781 &#160; &#160; $ 86,040 &#160; Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; &#160; 15 % &#160; ##TABLE_END General and administrative expenses were $433.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013, compared to $347.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $86.0 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $56.2 million in employee-related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in stock-based expenses. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 15 percent since January 31, 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements Loss from operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Loss from operations \n\n&#160; $ (110,710 ) &#160; $ (35,085 ) &#160; $ (75,625 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (4 )% &#160; &#160; (2 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Loss from operations during fiscal 2013 was $110.7 million and included $379.4 million of stock-based expenses and $88.2 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During fiscal 2012, loss from operations was $35.1 million and included $229.3 million of stock-based expenses and $67.3 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. \n\nInvestment income. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Investment income \n\n&#160; $ 19,562 &#160; &#160; $ 23,268 &#160; &#160; $ (3,706 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160; ##TABLE_END Investment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $19.6 million during fiscal 2013 and was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to fiscal 2012. \n\nInterest expense. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Interest expense \n\n&#160; $ (30,948 ) &#160; $ (17,045 ) &#160; $ (13,903 ) Percent of total revenues \n\n&#160; &#160; (1 )% &#160; &#160; (1 )% &#160; ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $30.9 million during fiscal 2013 and was $17.0 million during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we capitalized $2.4 million of interest costs related to capital projects. Capitalized interest during fiscal 2012 was $14.6 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to fiscal 2012. \n\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; &#160; Variance Dollars &#160; (in thousands) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; Benefit from (provision for) income taxes \n\n&#160; $ (142,651 ) &#160; $ 21,745 &#160; &#160; $ (164,396 ) Effective tax rate \n\n&#160; &#160; (112 )% &#160; &#160; 65 % &#160; ##TABLE_END We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million during fiscal 2013, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent. The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. \n\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nAt January 31, 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion and accounts receivable of $1.4 billion. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $875.5 million during fiscal 2014 and $736.9 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. \n\nOur working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. \n\nAs described above in &#147;Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,&#148; our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. \n\nWe generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 increased $138.6 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. During fiscal 2014, $8.1 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans was reclassified to cash flows from financing activities, as compared to $14.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase in net cash in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital accounts, primarily an increase in accounts receivables and a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements and other liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by approximately $30.0 million of payments made for the transaction fees incurred by ExactTarget and us related to the acquisition. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 billion during fiscal 2014 and $938.9 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 primarily related to the acquisition of EdgeSpring, Inc. (&#147;EdgeSpring&#148;) in June 2013, the acquisition of ExactTarget in July 2013, capital expenditures, including new office build-outs and a new intellectual property licensing agreement, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion during fiscal 2014 and $334.5 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of $1.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $84.8 million from proceeds from the issuance of warrants, $298.5 million of proceeds from the term loan, net of loan fees, and $289.9 million from proceeds from employee-related equity plans offset by $153.8 million for the purchase of hedges on the convertible note, $41.1 million of principal payments on capital leases and $15.0 million of principal payments on the term loan. \n\nIn July 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provides for a $300.0 million term loan (the &#147;Term Loan&#148;) that matures on July 11, 2016 (the &#147;Maturity Date&#148;). The Term Loan bears interest at our option under either a LIBOR-based formula or a base rate formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends, and certain other restrictions on our activities as defined in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreement&#146;s covenants as of January 31, 2014. \n\nThe weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. As of January 31 2014, the amount outstanding under the Term Loan was $285.0 million. Accrued interest on the Term Loan was $0.5 million as of January 31, 2014. During fiscal 2014, payments totaling $15.0 million were made on the Term Loan and subsequent payments of $7.5 million are due quarterly thereafter until the maturity date in July 2016 when the remaining outstanding principal amount is due. \n\nIn January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the &#147;0.75% Senior Notes&#148;) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the &#147;0.75% Note Hedges&#148;) and separate warrant transactions (the &#147;0.75% Warrants&#148;). The 0.75% Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.75% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. \n\nFor the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes were convertible at the holders&#146; option for the quarter ending January 31, 2014. For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2014, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes are convertible at the holders&#146; option for the quarter ending April 30, 2014. As the 0.75% Senior Notes are due on January 15, 2015, they are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. \n\nDuring the quarter ending April 30, 2014, we will repay in cash an aggregate principal balance of at least $280.0 million related to conversion requests of our 0.75% Senior Notes received through the date of the filing of \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements this Form 10-K. The excess of the conversion value that is greater than the principal amount will be delivered in shares of our common stock for the majority of the conversion requests received to date. If our stock price continues to exceed the conversion price of our 0.75% Senior Notes, we may continue to see conversion requests on the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015. \n\nIn March 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018 (the &#147;0.25% Senior Notes&#148;) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the &#147;0.25% Note Hedges&#148;) and separate warrant transactions (the &#147;0.25% Warrants&#148;). The 0.25% Senior Notes will mature on April 1, 2018, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.25% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. \n\nThe 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter commencing after April 30, 2013, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders&#146; option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2014, our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes will not be convertible at the holders&#146; option for the quarter ending April 30, 2014, and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. \n\nAs of January 31, 2014, we have a total of $55.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. \n\nWe do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. \n\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures.

Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The Financing Obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2014, $40.2 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progress&#151;leased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nDuring fiscal 2014 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. \n\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. \n\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), &#147;Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,&#148; defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. \n\nNon-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income \n\nWe use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. \n\nWe define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Stock-Based Expenses . The Company&#146;s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#146;s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer&#146;s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company&#146;s $575.0 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010 and the Company&#146;s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rates were approximately 5.9% for the notes issued in January 2010 and approximately 2.5% for the notes issued in March 2013, while the coupon interest rates were 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management&#146;s assessment of the Company&#146;s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company&#146;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Income Tax Effects and Adjustments . The Company&#146;s non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal year&#146;s ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Company&#146;s operational performance. \n\n##TABLE_END We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. \n\nWe define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. \n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share \n\nManagement uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. \n\nWe define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. \n\nLimitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures \n\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP \n\n&#160; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. \n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\nOur reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, &#147;gross profit,&#148; &#147;loss from operations,&#148; &#147;net loss&#148; and &#147;Net loss per share&#148; for the years ended January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;
