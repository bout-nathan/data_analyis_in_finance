"item_7_text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n(dollars in millions, except as noted and per share data) \n\nCompany Background \n\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866, and its consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) are engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America with additional operations in the Caribbean region and throughout Europe, Asia and Australia. \n\nThe Company is structured into three reportable segments &#8211; Paint Stores Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (collectively, the Reportable Segments) &#8211; and an Administrative segment in the same way it is internally organized for assessing performance and making decisions regarding the allocation of resources. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company changed its organizational structure to manage and report the Latin America architectural paint business within the Consumer Brands Group to more closely align demand and service model trends with its current business strategy. The Latin America business was formerly part of The Americas Group, which has become the Paint Stores Group concurrent with this change. The Company will report segment results for the newly realigned Paint Stores Group and Consumer Brands Group for both current and prior periods presented herein. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Company&#8217;s Reportable Segments. \n\nSummary \n\n&#8226; Consolidated Net sales increased 4.1% in the year to a record $23.052 billion \n\n&#9702; Net sales from stores in the Paint Stores Group open more than twelve calendar months increased 6.8% in the year \n\n&#8226; Diluted net income per share increased 19.8% to $9.25 per share in the year compared to $7.72 per share in the full year 2022 \n\n&#9702; Adjusted diluted net income per share increased to $10.35 per share in the year compared to $8.73 per share in the full year 2022 \n\n&#8226; Generated Net operating cash of $3.522 billion, or 15.3% of net sales, in the year \n\n&#8226; Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) increased 17.5% in the year to $4.239 billion or 18.4% of net sales \n\nOutlook \n\nDuring 2023, we executed on our strategy to provide differentiated solutions to enable our customers to increase their productivity and profitability. Net sales grew to a record level, gross margin expanded due to moderating raw material costs and carryover price increases, and Net operating cash increased due to record Net income and improved working capital management. This performance enabled us to continue to invest in our business through customer-focused innovation, complete the acquisition of SIC Holding GmbH, reduce short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We enter 2024 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities in our targeted end-markets, although uncertainties do remain in the marketplace. \n\nWithin Paint Stores Group and Consumer Brands Group, we anticipate continued inflationary pressure in 2024 to impact consumer behavior in both the United States and Europe, particularly in housing markets. While mortgage rates are expected to remain high compared to recent historical levels, we expect them to moderate and positively impact new and existing residential sales volume. We also remain focused on gaining market share and leveraging our strategic investments to counteract forecasted declines in remodeling spend in 2024. The outlook for the Performance Coatings Group is varied by end market and region with expected resilience in Automotive Refinish and tailwinds in Industrial Wood. Demand softness is forecasted in General Industrial due to negative manufacturing trends in North America, Europe and Brazil and in Packaging due to expected flat-to-down volumes in the food and beverage industry. As it relates to consolidated expenses, while we expect raw material costs to be down by a low-single digit percentage, certain other costs, such as wages, healthcare, energy and transportation are expected to increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase moderately in 2024 to support targeted investments, but remain tightly controlled in non-customer facing functions. \n\nOur capital deployment strategy remains balanced and consistent. Long-term debt maturities due in 2024 are $1.100 billion and are expected to be refinanced at higher interest rates. We have plans to continue to invest in the construction of new facilities, including our new global headquarters in downtown Cleveland, Ohio and new research and development center in the Cleveland suburb of Brecksville, and in the expansion of certain existing manufacturing and distribution facilities. We plan to \n\nexpand our footprint by opening 80 to 100 new stores in the United States and Canada in 2024, and pursue acquisitions that align with our long-term growth strategy. We will also return value to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and the reinvestment of excess cash for share repurchases of Company stock. \n\nPlease see Item 1A Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the current and potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company, including those relating to supply chain disruptions, raw material availability, foreign currency and inflation. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following discussion and analysis addresses comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, see Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed on February 22, 2023. \n\nNet Sales \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 $ Change % Change Currency Impact Acquisitions and Divestitures Impact Paint Stores Group $ 12,839.5 &#160; $ 11,963.3 $ 876.2 7.3 % (0.1) % &#8212; % Consumer Brands Group 3,365.6 &#160; 3,388.4 (22.8) (0.7) % (0.4) % (1.9) % Performance Coatings Group 6,843.1 &#160; 6,793.5 49.6 0.7 % 0.3 % 4.1 % Administrative 3.7 &#160; 3.7 &#8212; &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % Total $ 23,051.9 &#160; $ 22,148.9 $ 903.0 4.1 % &#8212; % 1.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\nConsolidated Net sales for 2023 increased 4.1% primarily due to selling price increases, volume growth due to higher architectural sales volume in the Paint Stores Group and a 1.0% net increase from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures completed during the past twelve months, partially offset by sales volume decreases in the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Groups. Net sales of all consolidated foreign subsidiaries increased 3.1% to $4.428 billion for 2023 versus $4.294 billion for 2022 due primarily to growth in the Europe and Latin America regions, partially offset by lower net sales in the Asia region as a result of the divestiture of the China architectural business. Net sales of all operations other than consolidated foreign subsidiaries increased 4.3% to $18.624 billion for 2023 versus $17.855 billion for 2022. \n\nNet sales in the Paint Stores Group increased 7.3% primarily due to mid-single digit sales volume growth and selling price increases, which impacted net sales by a low-single digit percentage. Net sales from stores in the Paint Stores Group open for more than twelve calendar months increased 6.8% in the year over the prior year comparable period. During 2023, the Paint Stores Group opened 76 new stores and closed 6 locations for a net increase of 70 stores. The total number of stores in operation at December 31, 2023 was 4,694 in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean region. The Paint Stores Group&#8217;s objective is to expand its store base by an approximate average of 2% each year, primarily through organic growth. Sales of products other than paint increased approximately 5.0% over last year. A discussion of changes in volume versus pricing for sales of products other than paint is not pertinent due to the wide assortment of general merchandise sold. \n\nNet sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 0.7% in 2023 primarily due to a low-single digit sales volume decrease and a 1.9% decrease from the impact of divestitures, partially offset by selling prices increases, which impacted net sales by a mid-single digit percentage. \n\nNet sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 0.7% in 2023 primarily due to selling price increases, which impacted net sales by a mid-single digit percentage, and a 4.1% increase from the impact of acquisitions completed during the past twelve months, partially offset by a high-single digit sales volume decrease. In 2023, the Performance Coatings Group added 5 net new branches, increasing the total to 322 branches open in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia. \n\nNet sales in the Administrative segment, which primarily consists of external leasing revenue, remained flat in 2023. \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes \n\nThe following table presents the components of income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % of Net Sales % of Net Sales Net sales $ 23,051.9 100.0 &#160; % $ 22,148.9 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 12,293.8 53.3 &#160; % 12,823.8 57.9 % Gross profit 10,758.1 46.7 &#160; % 9,325.1 42.1 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A) 7,065.4 30.6 &#160; % 6,331.6 28.6 % Other general expense (income) - net 67.1 0.3 &#160; % (24.9) (0.1) % Impairment 57.9 0.3 &#160; % 15.5 0.1% Interest expense 417.5 1.8 &#160; % 390.8 1.8 % Interest income (25.2) (0.1) % (8.0) &#8212; % Other expense (income) - net 65.5 0.3 &#160; % 47.0 0.1 % Income before income taxes $ 3,109.9 13.5 &#160; % $ 2,573.1 11.6 % ##TABLE_END\n\nConsolidated Cost of goods sold decreased $530.0 million, or 4.1%, in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to lower sales volumes in the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Groups and moderating raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volume in the Paint Stores Group and the impacts of increases in wages and other employee-related expenses. In 2023, certain manufacturing and distribution costs (excluding raw materials) incurred within the Consumer Brands Group were in excess of the Company&#8217;s standard conversion cost estimates established at the beginning of the year. Consistent with prior years, these expenses were related to supply chain inefficiencies and remained within the manufacturing and distribution operations of the Consumer Brands Group. \n\nConsolidated Gross profit increased $1.433 billion, or 15.4%, in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Consolidated Gross profit as a percent to consolidated Net sales increased to 46.7% in 2023 from 42.1% in 2022. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased primarily due to selling price increases in all Reportable Segments, higher sales volume in the Paint Stores Group and moderating raw material costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Groups. \n\nThe Paint Stores Group&#8217;s gross profit for 2023 increased $908.6 million compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to sales volume growth, selling price increases and moderating raw material costs. The Paint Stores Group&#8217;s gross profit as a percent of net sales increased for these same reasons. The Consumer Brands Group&#8217;s gross profit increased $139.3 million in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily to selling price increases and moderating raw material costs, partially offset by a sales volume decrease and increases in wages and other employee-related expenses in manufacturing and distribution operations. The Consumer Brands Group&#8217;s gross profit as a percent of net sales increased for these same reasons. The Performance Coatings Group&#8217;s gross profit increased $402.2 million compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily to higher selling prices, moderating raw material costs and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower sales volume and increases in wages and other employee-related expenses. The Performance Coatings Group&#8217;s gross profit as a percent of net sales increased for these same reasons. \n\nConsolidated SG&#38;A increased by $733.8 million compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses, including incentive-based compensation expense, expenses to support higher sales levels and net new store openings. As a percent of Net sales, SG&#38;A increased 200 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 for these same reasons. \n\nThe Paint Stores Group&#8217;s SG&#38;A increased $401.4 million for the year due primarily to higher employee-related expenses, increased spending from new store openings, higher costs to serve customers, increased investments in technologies and costs to support higher sales levels, including the hiring of additional sales representatives. The Consumer Brands Group&#8217;s SG&#38;A increased $64.5 million for the year primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and increased spending to support higher sales levels in Latin America. The Performance Coatings Group&#8217;s SG&#38;A increased by $139.9 million for the year primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, costs from acquisitions and investments in technology. The Administrative segment&#8217;s SG&#38;A increased $128.0 million primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including stock-based and other incentive compensation, as well as increased expenses related to technology and systems. \n\nOther general expense (income) - net changed by $92.0 million from income of $(24.9) million in 2022 to an expense of $67.1 million in 2023. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in provisions for environmental matters - net due to new information which impacted the estimate of required remediation at certain Major Sites and other Company locations. In addition, the Company incurred a modest loss on the sale or disposition of assets versus a gain in the prior year. These decreases were offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core domestic aerosol business in 2023. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nFor information on impairment considerations, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \n\nInterest expense increased $26.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding debt. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Company&#8217;s outstanding debt. \n\nOther expense (income) - net increased $18.5 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso in December 2023 as part of economic reforms implemented by the government of Argentina. As a result of these actions in Argentina, the Company incurred a loss of $41.8 million. In addition, the Company incurred a loss on the extinguishment of its Debentures due 2027 and 2097 of $12.8 million. These increases were partially offset by gains on investments held in the Administrative segment and miscellaneous pension and benefit income. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to Other expense (income) - net. \n\nThe following table presents income before income taxes by segment and as a percentage of net sales by segment: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 $ Change % Change Income Before Income Taxes: \n\nPaint Stores Group $ 2,860.8 $ 2,348.1 $ 512.7 21.8 % Consumer Brands Group \n\n309.3 314.2 (4.9) (1.6) % Performance Coatings Group \n\n991.6 734.9 256.7 34.9 % Administrative (1,051.8) (824.1) (227.7) (27.6) % Total \n\n$ 3,109.9 $ 2,573.1 $ 536.8 20.9 % Income Before Income Taxes as a % of Net Sales: Paint Stores Group 22.3 &#160; % 19.6 % Consumer Brands Group \n\n9.2 &#160; % 9.3 % Performance Coatings Group \n\n14.5 &#160; % 10.8 % Administrative nm nm Total \n\n13.5 &#160; % 11.6 % nm - not meaningful ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2023 was 23.2% compared to 21.5% in 2022. The increase in the effective rate was primarily due to an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nNet Income Per Share \n\nDiluted net income per share for 2023 increased to $9.25 per share from $7.72 per share in 2022. Diluted net income per share in 2023 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.78 per share, severance and other expense of $0.04 per share, expenses related to the divestiture of the China architectural business of $0.11 per share, impairment related to trademarks of $0.07 per share and expense related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso of $0.16 per share. These expenses were partially offset by a gain on the divestiture of a non-core domestic aerosol business of $0.06 per share. Currency translation rate changes increased diluted net income per share in the year by $0.05 per share. Diluted net income per share in 2022 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.81 per share, severance and other expense of $0.15 per share and impairment \n\nrelated to the Restructuring Plan of $0.05 per share. Refer to Notes 3, 4, 7 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW \n\nOverview \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial condition, liquidity and cash flow continued to be strong in 2023. The Company generated $3.522 billion in Net operating cash, primarily due to higher net income and improved working capital management. This strong cash generation enabled the Company to invest $1.011 billion in capital expenditures and approximately $265 million in the acquisition of SIC Holding, reduce short-term borrowings and long-term debt by $718.8 million and return $2.056 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases during the year. \n\nDuring 2023, the Company generated EBITDA of $4.150 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.239 billion. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the definitions and calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $276.8 million and total debt outstanding of $9.851 billion. Total debt, net of Cash and cash equivalents, was $9.574 billion and was 2.3 times the Company&#8217;s Adjusted EBITDA in 2023. \n\nNet Working Capital \n\nNet working capital, defined as Total current assets less Total current liabilities, decreased $1.061 billion to a deficit of $1.114 billion at December 31, 2023 from a deficit of $53.0 million at December 31, 2022. The net working capital decrease was primarily due to an increase in the Current portion of long-term debt and a decrease in current assets, particularly Inventories, partially offset by a decrease in Short-term borrowings. \n\nComparing current asset balances at December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2022, Accounts receivable decreased $95.7 million, Inventories decreased $296.7 million due to lower inventory levels and moderating raw material costs and Other current assets decreased $80.4 million, primarily related to prepaid expenses and refundable income taxes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Cash and cash equivalents of $78.0 million. \n\nCurrent liability balances increased $666.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 primarily due an increase in the Current portion of long-term debt of $1.098 billion, an increase in Other Accruals of $191.2 million, primarily related to liabilities from contracts with customers, environmental-related liabilities and miscellaneous other current liabilities, and an increase in Compensation and taxes withheld of $78.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Short-term borrowings of $603.9 million and Accounts payable of $121.5 million. \n\nAs a result of the net effect of these changes, the Company&#8217;s current ratio decreased to 0.83 at December 31, 2023 from 0.99 at December 31, 2022. Accounts receivable as a percent of Net sales decreased to 10.7% in 2023 from 11.6% in 2022. Accounts receivable days outstanding was 58 days in 2023 and 2022. In 2023, provisions for the allowance for current expected credit losses increased $3.0 million, or 5.3%. Inventories as a percent of Net sales decreased to 10.1% in 2023 from 11.9% in 2022. Inventory days outstanding was 94 days in 2023 compared to 98 days in 2022. The Company has sufficient total available borrowing capacity to fund its current operating needs. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\nNet property, plant and equipment increased $629.8 million to $2.837 billion at December 31, 2023 due primarily to capital expenditures of $1.011 billion, partially offset by depreciation expense of $292.3 million, sale or disposition of assets with remaining net book value of $88.0 million, and currency translation and other adjustments of $(0.5) million. During 2023, the Company closed on a transaction to sell and subsequently lease back its current headquarters and research and development center. In connection with the sale, proceeds of $47.2 million were received and an immaterial gain was recognized. \n\nCapital expenditures during 2023 in the Paint Stores Group were primarily attributable to the opening of new paint stores and renovations and improvements in existing stores. In the Consumer Brands Group and the Performance Coatings Group, capital expenditures during 2023 were primarily related to ongoing environmental compliance measures, manufacturing capacity expansion, operational efficiencies and maintenance projects at sites currently in operation. The Administrative segment incurred capital expenditures primarily related to construction activities associated with the new headquarters and research and development center. Construction of the new headquarters and research and development center is expected to be completed in 2024 at the earliest. \n\nIn 2024, the Company expects to spend approximately the same as 2023 for capital expenditures, which it will fund primarily through the generation of operating cash. Core capital expenditures are targeted to be less than 2% of Net sales in 2024 and are expected to be for investments in various productivity improvement and maintenance projects at existing manufacturing, distribution and research and development facilities and new store openings. Additionally, the Company will continue to \n\nconstruct its new headquarters and research and development center. Refer to the Real Estate Financing section herein for further information on the financing transaction for the new headquarters. \n\nReal Estate Financing \n\nIn December 2022, the Company closed a transaction to sell and subsequently lease back its partially-constructed new headquarters. As part of the terms of the transaction, the Company is contractually obligated for completing the construction of the building and related improvements at the new headquarters. This transaction did not meet the criteria for recognition as an asset sale under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) and as such, was accounted for as a real estate financing transaction. The Company expects to receive proceeds approximating $800 million to $850 million on an incremental basis until the completion of construction. The initial lease term includes the construction period and extends for 30 years thereafter, and the Company has the right and option to extend the lease term. The lease payment amounts during the construction period are dependent upon the timing and amount of total reimbursement of construction and other costs received by the Company. Lease payments over the next twelve months, which is the remaining estimated construction period, are expected to be approximately $40 million. The amount of the lease payments during the initial 30 year lease term will be calculated upon completion of the construction period and receipt of total reimbursement of construction and other costs. Once determinable, this is expected to result in a significant increase in the Company&#8217;s long-term contractual obligations. \n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company received $305.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively, pursuant to the transaction. The net proceeds from this transaction and other real estate financing transactions are recognized as proceeds from real estate financing transactions within the Financing Activities section of the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. The corresponding financing obligation for the new headquarters was $515.8 million and $207.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of the liability recorded in Other accruals was $39.9 million and $20.0 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2023, $23.8 million of interest was capitalized with the long-term portion of the liability in Other long-term liabilities. The Company will continue to recognize the related assets within Property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under US GAAP. These assets will be subject to depreciation over their useful lives in accordance with the Company&#8217;s accounting policies. The Company will also allocate payments between interest and repayment of the financing liability over the life of the agreement. \n\nRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8 for further information. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations, increased $42.8 million in 2023, primarily due to foreign currency translation rate fluctuations and purchase accounting allocations of $8.3 million. \n\nIntangible assets decreased $121.5 million in 2023 primarily due to amortization of finite-lived intangible assets of $325.0 million, dispositions of $83.4 million and trademark impairment charges of $30.9 million, partially offset by purchase accounting allocations of $306.7 million and foreign currency translation rate fluctuations. \n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a description of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and asset impairments and summaries of the remaining carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets. \n\nOther Assets \n\nOther assets increased $183.5 million to $1.211 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-traded investments and other assets related to contracts with customers and deposits. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nDebt (including Short-term borrowings) \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Long-term debt $ 9,476.7 &#160; $ 9,591.6 Short-term borrowings 374.2 &#160; 978.1 Total debt outstanding $ 9,850.9 &#160; $ 10,569.7 ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal debt outstanding, including Short-term borrowings, decreased by $718.8 million to $9.851 billion in 2023. Short-term borrowings are primarily comprised of amounts outstanding under the Company&#8217;s domestic commercial paper program and various foreign credit facilities. The Company&#8217;s Long-term debt primarily consists of senior notes. The Company targets Net \n\ndebt, which is total debt outstanding, net of Cash and cash equivalents, to be 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. At December 31, 2023, Net debt was $9.574 billion and was 2.3 times the Company&#8217;s EBITDA in 2023. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the definition and calculation of EBITDA. \n\nIn December 2023, the Company exercised its call provision to make-whole the entire outstanding $119.4 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.375% Debentures due 2027 and the entire outstanding $3.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.45% Debentures due 2097. The retirement of the Debentures resulted in a loss of $12.8 million recorded in Other general expense (income) - net. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s available capacity under its committed credit agreements is reduced for amounts outstanding under its domestic commercial paper program and letters of credit. At December 31, 2023, the Company had unused capacity under its various credit agreements of $3.332 billion. \n\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a detailed description and summary of the Company&#8217;s outstanding debt, short-term borrowings and other available financing programs. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nIn accordance with the accounting prescribed by the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company&#8217;s total liability for unfunded or underfunded defined benefit pension plans increased $10.5 million to $69.0 million primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company&#8217;s liability for other postretirement benefits decreased $6.6 million to $147.2 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to changes in the actuarial assumptions. \n\nThe assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plan decreased to 5.1% at December 31, 2023 from 5.3% at December 31, 2022. The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for foreign defined benefit pension plans decreased to 4.8% at December 31, 2023 from 5.1% at December 31, 2022. The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations decreased to 5.0% at December 31, 2023 from 5.2% at December 31, 2022. The decrease in the discount rates was primarily due to lower interest rates. \n\nIn deciding on the rates of compensation increases, management considered historical Company increases as well as expectations for future increases. The rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2023 was 3.0% for the domestic pension plan and 3.3% for foreign pension plans, which was comparable to the rates used in the prior year. \n\nIn establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, management considered the historical rates of return, the nature of investments and an expectation for future investment strategies. The expected long-term rate of return on assets for the domestic defined benefit pension plan was 6.3% at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The expected long-term rate of return on assets for the foreign defined benefit pension plans decreased to 4.8% at December 31, 2023 from 5.5% at December 31, 2022. \n\nIn developing the assumed health care cost trend rates, management considered industry data, historical Company experience and expectations for future health care costs. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2023 were 6.0% and 9.0% for medical and prescription drug cost increases, respectively, both decreasing gradually to 4.5% in 2032. The assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and prescription costs used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2022 were 5.5% and 8.3%, respectively. \n\nThe respective year-end assumptions described above for the Company&#8217;s defined benefit plans are also used to determine expense for the next year. Net pension cost in 2024 for the domestic pension plan and foreign pension plans is expected to be approximately $1.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit credit for other postretirement benefits in 2024 is expected to be approximately $17.0 million. The credit for 2024 is primarily due to amortization of the impact of a plan amendment executed in 2022. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Company&#8217;s obligations and funded status of its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. \n\nDeferred Income Taxes \n\nDeferred income taxes at December 31, 2023 increased $1.5 million from the prior year primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities from acquired intangible assets, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets in the current year. See Notes 3 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on deferred taxes. \n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities \n\nOther long-term liabilities increased $301.6 million during 2023 due primarily to liabilities associated with real estate financing transactions and an increase in long-term commitments related to investments in U.S. affordable housing and historic \n\nrenovation real estate partnerships, partially offset by the impact of expected settlements related to tax positions over the next twelve months as disclosed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nThe operations of the Company, like those of other companies in the same industry, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on the Company for past operations. Management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the Company and the industry in the future. Management believes that the Company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance. \n\nDuring 2023, environmental-related liabilities increased $28.5 million to $318.9 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to new information which impacted the estimate of required remediation at certain Major Sites and other Company locations. Depreciation of capital expenditures and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business. The Company&#8217;s capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were not material to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations during 2023. Management does not expect that such capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses will be material to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations in 2024. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on environmental-related liabilities. \n\nContractual and Other Obligations and Commercial Commitments \n\nThe Company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual and other obligations and commercial commitments. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under long-term and short-term debt, including its committed credit agreements and commercial paper program, will be sufficient for it to meet its contractual and other obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables summarize such obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2023. \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period Contractual and Other Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1&#8211;3 Years 3&#8211;5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt $ 9,550.8 $ 1,100.2 $ 1,400.6 $ 1,500.0 $ 5,550.0 Interest on Long-term debt 4,212.3 332.2 550.1 416.8 2,913.2 Operating leases 2,189.5 513.5 816.6 475.5 383.9 Short-term borrowings 374.2 374.2 \n\nReal estate financing transactions (1) \n\n163.4 15.5 31.0 32.7 84.2 \n\nPurchase obligations (2) \n\n427.1 427.1 \n\nOther contractual obligations (3) \n\n747.5 162.7 163.8 143.4 277.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 17,664.8 $ 2,925.4 $ 2,962.1 $ 2,568.4 $ 9,208.9 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes real estate financing transactions related to the new headquarters. Refer to &#8220;Real Estate Financing&#8221; section herein for further information. \n\n(2) Relates to open purchase orders for raw materials at December 31, 2023. \n\n(3) Relates primarily to estimated future capital contributions for investments in the U.S. affordable housing and historic renovation real estate partnerships and various other contractual obligations. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Commercial Commitments Total Less Than 1 Year 1&#8211;3 Years 3&#8211;5 Years More Than 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 146.2 $ 146.2 Surety bonds 230.4 230.4 Total commercial commitments $ 376.6 $ 376.6 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nWarranties \n\nThe Company offers product warranties for certain products. The specific terms and conditions of such warranties vary depending on the product or customer contract requirements. Management estimated the costs of unsettled product warranty claims based on historical results and experience and included an amount in Other accruals. Management periodically assesses the adequacy of the accrual for product warranty claims and adjusts the accrual as necessary. Changes in the Company&#8217;s accrual for product warranty claims during 2023 and 2022, including customer satisfaction settlements during the year, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 Balance at January 1 $ 36.2 &#160; $ 35.2 Charges to expense 37.0 &#160; 30.1 Settlements (32.8) (29.1) Balance at December 31 $ 40.4 &#160; $ 36.2 ##TABLE_END\n\nShareholders&#8217; Equity \n\nShareholders&#8217; equity increased $613.7 million to $3.716 billion at December 31, 2023 from $3.102 billion last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the generation of $2.389 billion of Net income and benefits from stock option exercises and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense of $203.9 million. This was partially offset by the repurchase of $1.432 billion in Treasury stock and the payment of $623.7 million in cash dividends. See the Statements of Consolidated Shareholders&#8217; Equity and Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nThe Company purchased 5.6 million shares of its common stock for treasury purposes through open market purchases during 2023. The Company acquires its common stock for general corporate purposes, and depending on its cash position and market conditions, it may acquire shares in the future. The Company had remaining authorization from its Board of Directors at December 31, 2023 to purchase 39.6 million shares of its common stock. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s 2023 annual cash dividend of $2.42 per share represented 31% of 2022 diluted net income per share. The 2023 annual dividend represented the 45 th consecutive year of increased dividend payments. On February 14, 2024, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.715 per share. This quarterly dividend, if approved in each of the remaining quarters of 2024, would result in an annual dividend for 2024 of $2.86 per share, or a 31% payout of 2023 diluted net income per share. \n\nCash Flow \n\nNet operating cash increased $1.602 billion in 2023 to a cash source of $3.522 billion from a cash source of $1.920 billion in 2022 due primarily to improved working capital management and higher net income. Net operating cash increased as a percent to Net sales to 15.3% in 2023 compared to 8.7% in 2022. \n\nNet investing cash usage decreased $568.3 million to a usage of $1.039 billion in 2023 from a usage of $1.608 billion in 2022 due primarily to lower cash used for acquisitions, proceeds from the divestiture of businesses and an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by increased cash used for capital expenditures. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nNet financing cash usage increased $2.142 billion to a usage of $2.425 billion in 2023 from a usage of $282.4 million in 2022. This increase was due primarily to proceeds from long-term debt in 2022 which did not occur in 2023, a net decrease in short-term borrowings and an increase in treasury stock purchases, partially offset by lower payments of long-term debt and higher proceeds from real estate financing transactions. \n\nLitigation \n\nSee Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning litigation. \n\nMarket Risk \n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall financial risk management policy, but does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. In 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of less than twelve months primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency and cross currency swap contracts to hedge its net investment in European operations. See Notes 1, 17 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to the Company&#8217;s use of derivative instruments. \n\nThe Company believes it may be exposed to continuing market risk from foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations. However, the Company does not expect that foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract losses will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 1 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to foreign currency translation. \n\nFinancial Covenant \n\nCertain borrowings contain a consolidated leverage covenant. The covenant states the Company&#8217;s consolidated leverage ratio is not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00; however, the Company may elect to temporarily increase the leverage ratio to 4.25 to 1.00 for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following the consummation of a qualifying acquisition, as defined in the credit agreement dated August 30, 2022. The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total indebtedness (the sum of Short-term borrowings, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt) at the reporting date to consolidated &#8220;Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization&#8221; (EBITDA), as defined in the credit agreement, for the 12-month period ended on the same date. Refer to the &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; section for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Net income. At December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the covenant and expects to remain in compliance. The Company&#8217;s notes, debentures and revolving credit agreements contain various default and cross-default provisions. In the event of default under any one of these arrangements, acceleration of the maturity of any one or more of these borrowings may result. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \n\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan \n\nParticipants in the Company&#8217;s defined contribution savings plan are allowed to contribute up to the lesser of fifty percent of their annual compensation or the maximum dollar amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches one hundred percent of all contributions up to six percent of eligible employee contributions. The Company&#8217;s matching contributions to the defined contribution savings plan charged to operations were $153.9 million in 2023 compared to $140.0 million in 2022. At December 31, 2023, there were 18,680,108 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock being held by the defined contribution savings plan, representing 7.3% of the total number of voting shares outstanding. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information concerning the Company&#8217;s defined contribution savings plan. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nManagement utilizes certain financial measures that are not in accordance with US GAAP to analyze and manage the performance of the business. The required disclosures for these non-GAAP measures are shown below. The Company provides such non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate the Company&#8217;s operations. Management does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP. \n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA \n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Net income before Income taxes, Interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as EBITDA that excludes certain adjustments that management believes enhances investors&#8217; understanding of the Company&#8217;s operating performance. Management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA useful in understanding the operating performance of the Company. The reader is cautioned that the Company&#8217;s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be compared to other entities unknowingly. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to Net income or Net operating cash as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. The reader should refer to the determination of Net income and Net operating cash in accordance with US GAAP disclosed in the Statements of Consolidated Income and Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows in Item 8. \n\nThe following table summarizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by management for the years indicated below: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net income $ 2,388.8 &#160; $ 2,020.1 Interest expense 417.5 &#160; 390.8 Income taxes 721.1 &#160; 553.0 Depreciation 292.3 &#160; 264.0 Amortization 330.2 &#160; 317.1 EBITDA 4,149.9 &#160; 3,545.0 Restructuring expense 9.6 &#160; 47.3 Impairment related to Restructuring Plan 34.0 &#160; 15.5 Gain on divestiture of domestic aerosol business (20.1) &#8212; Impairment related to trademarks 23.9 &#160; &#8212; Devaluation of the Argentine Peso 41.8 &#160; &#8212; Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,239.1 &#160; $ 3,607.8 ##TABLE_END\n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Net operating cash, as shown in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, less the amount reinvested in the business for capital expenditures and the return on investment to its shareholders by the payments of cash dividends. Management considers free cash flow to be a useful tool in its determination of appropriate uses of the Company&#8217;s Net operating cash. The reader is cautioned that the free cash flow measure should not be compared to other entities unknowingly as it may not be comparable and it does not consider certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt and interest payments. The amount shown below should not be considered an alternative to Net operating cash or other cash flow amounts provided in accordance with US GAAP as disclosed in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in Item 8. \n\nThe following table summarizes free cash flow as calculated by management for the years indicated below: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net operating cash $ 3,521.9 &#160; $ 1,919.9 Capital expenditures (888.4) (644.5) Cash dividends (623.7) (618.5) Free cash flow $ 2,009.8 &#160; $ 656.9 ##TABLE_END\n\nAdjusted Diluted Net Income Per Share \n\nManagement of the Company believes that investors&#8217; understanding of the Company&#8217;s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and certain other adjustments. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n\nThe following tables reconcile diluted net income per share computed in accordance with US GAAP to adjusted diluted net income per share. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 Pre-Tax Tax Effect (1) \n\nAfter-Tax Diluted net income per share $ 9.25 Items related to Restructuring Plan: Severance and other $ .06 $ .02 .04 Impairment of assets related to China divestiture .13 .08 .05 Gain on divestiture of domestic aerosol business (.08) (.02) (.06) Discrete income tax expense related to China divestiture (1) \n\n&#8212; (.06) .06 Total .11 .02 .09 Impairment related to trademarks .09 .02 .07 Devaluation of the Argentine Peso .16 &#8212; .16 \n\nAcquisition-related amortization expense (2) \n\n1.03 .25 .78 Adjusted diluted net income per share $ 10.35 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Pre-Tax Tax Effect (1) \n\nAfter-Tax Diluted net income per share $ 7.72 Items related to Restructuring Plan: Severance and other $ .18 $ .03 .15 Impairment .06 .01 .05 Total .24 .04 .20 \n\nAcquisition-related amortization expense (2) \n\n1.06 .25 .81 Adjusted diluted net income per share $ 8.73 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The tax effect is calculated based on the statutory rate and the nature of the item, unless otherwise noted. \n\n(2) Acquisition-related amortization expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition and is included within Selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nAdjusted Segment Profit \n\nManagement of the Company believes that investors&#8217; understanding of the Company&#8217;s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of segment profit excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and certain other adjustments. This adjusted segment profit measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a substitute for segment profit in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile segment profit computed in accordance with US GAAP to adjusted segment profit. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2023 Paint Stores Group Consumer Brands Group Performance Coatings Group Administrative Total Net sales $ 12,839.5 $ 3,365.6 $ 6,843.1 $ 3.7 $ 23,051.9 Income before income taxes $ 2,860.8 $ 309.3 $ 991.6 $ (1,051.8) $ 3,109.9 as a % of Net sales 22.3 % 9.2 % 14.5 % 13.5 % Items related to Restructuring Plan: Severance and other 14.2 (0.2) 1.3 15.3 Impairment of assets related to China divestiture 6.9 27.1 34.0 Gain on divestiture of domestic aerosol business (20.1) (20.1) Total &#8212; 21.1 (0.2) 8.3 29.2 Impairment related to trademarks 23.9 23.9 Devaluation of the Argentine Peso 30.8 11.0 41.8 \n\nAcquisition-related amortization \n\nexpense (1) \n\n69.3 196.8 266.1 Adjusted segment profit $ 2,860.8 $ 454.4 $ 1,199.2 $ (1,043.5) $ 3,470.9 as a % of Net sales 22.3 % 13.5 % 17.5 % 15.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Paint Stores Group Consumer Brands Group Performance Coatings Group Administrative Total Net sales $ 11,963.3 $ 3,388.4 $ 6,793.5 $ 3.7 $ 22,148.9 Income before income taxes $ 2,348.1 $ 314.2 $ 734.9 $ (824.1) $ 2,573.1 as a % of Net sales 19.6 % 9.3 % 10.8 % 11.6 % Items related to Restructuring Plan: Severance and other 25.6 22.2 47.8 Impairment 15.5 15.5 Total &#8212; 41.1 22.2 &#8212; 63.3 \n\nAcquisition-related amortization \n\nexpense (1) \n\n76.2 200.1 276.3 Adjusted segment profit $ 2,348.1 $ 431.5 $ 957.2 $ (824.1) $ 2,912.7 as a % of Net sales 19.6 % 12.7 % 14.1 % 13.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Acquisition-related amortization expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These determinations were made based upon management&#8217;s best estimates, judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the critical accounting policies and estimates described below. However, application of these critical accounting policies and estimates involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. \n\nAll of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined principally on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter. Inventory quantities are adjusted throughout the year as formal cycle counts are completed, or during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts. If inventories accounted for on the LIFO method are reduced on a year-over-year basis, then liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years occurs. Management records the best estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and discontinued inventories based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included in Cost of goods sold. If management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the LIFO inventory valuation and the reserve for obsolescence. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nIn accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management performs impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has occurred on a more likely than not basis. An optional qualitative assessment allows companies to forego the annual quantitative test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key Company financial performance metrics and macroeconomic conditions. The qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate. \n\nIn accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Per the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below the operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. At the time of goodwill impairment testing (if performing a quantitative assessment), management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value, the difference represents the amount of impairment attributable to the reporting unit. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include a discount rate, growth rates, cash flow projections and a terminal value rate. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and a low long-term growth rate. As an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting units&#8217; fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company within a reasonable and supportable control premium. \n\nThe Company had seven components, some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics, to form three reporting units (also the operating segments) with goodwill as of October 1, 2023, the date of the annual impairment test. The \n\nCompany performed the optional qualitative impairment test as of October 1, 2023, and determined that there was no indication of impairment on a more likely than not basis in the Company&#8217;s three reporting units. \n\nIn accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition. Management utilizes the royalty savings method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset or trademark. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include a discount rate, a royalty rate, growth rates, sales projections, a terminal value rate and, to a lesser extent, a tax rate. The discount rate used is similar to the rate developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in Company-specific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks. The royalty rate is established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Operational management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and a low long-term growth rate. The royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in 2023 impairment testing are consistent with prior years. The annual impairment review performed as of October 1, 2023 resulted in trademark impairment of $23.9 million in the Consumer Brands Group primarily related to a trademark in Europe. No other impairments or risks for impairment were identified as a result of this review. \n\nThe discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed from the perspective of a market participant. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC. \n\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets \n\nIn accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets, including Operating lease right-of-use assets, may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed, impairment tests are performed or the useful life is adjusted. Undiscounted cash flows are used to calculate the recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets are recoverable. If the carrying value of the assets is deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the Fair Value Topic of the ASC. If the usefulness of an asset is determined to be impaired, an updated useful life is assessed based on the period of time for projected use of the asset. Fair value approaches and changes in useful life are based on certain assumptions and information available at the time the valuation or determination is performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions. As of October 1, 2023, the Company performed an analysis and determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances to suggest the carrying value of each long-lived asset group is not recoverable and therefore, no further impairment tests were performed. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of long-lived assets in accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nTo determine the Company&#8217;s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, management estimates the future cost of benefits and attributes that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works. To determine the obligations of the benefit plans, management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions which include discount rates, inflation rates, long-term investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs. Management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is considered. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management&#8217;s control could have a direct impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial condition. \n\nIn accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company recognizes each plan&#8217;s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amounts recorded in AOCI will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning the Company&#8217;s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nThe Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the Company). The Company initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs, which are mostly undiscounted, are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site. If the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range, the minimum of the range is provided. \n\nThe Company routinely assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued. Actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning the accrual for extended environmental-related activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies. \n\nLitigation and Other Contingent Liabilities \n\nIn the course of its business, the Company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust claims. Management accrues for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with US GAAP. However, because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable, the Company&#8217;s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued. In the event that the Company&#8217;s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on Net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties involved, any potential liability determined to be attributable to the Company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning litigation. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company estimates income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it conducts operations. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will be made in the period in which the changes occur. \n\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our Statements of Consolidated Income in the period in which these events occur. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning income taxes. \n\n"}
