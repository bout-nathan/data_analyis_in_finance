MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled &#8220;Forward-Looking Information&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. \n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2025 and 2024, as well as certain fiscal 2023 items. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. \n\nOverview \n\nSalesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. \n\nOur platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. \n\nWe continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. \n\nIn addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales a nd marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. \n\nHighlights from Fiscal 2025 \n\n&#8226; Revenue: For fiscal 2025, revenue was $37.9 billion , an increase of nine percent year-over-year. \n\n&#8226; Income from Operations: For fiscal 2025, income from operations was $7.2 billion as compared to $5.0 billion from a year ago. Operating margin, which represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue, increased to approximately 19 percent for fiscal 2025 compared to approximately 14 percent in the prior year. \n\n&#8226; Net Income per Share: For fiscal 2025 , diluted net income per share was $6.36 as compared to diluted net income per share of $4.20 from a year ago. \n\n&#8226; Cash: Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2025 was $13.1 billion, an increase of 28 percent y ear-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 was $14.0 billion. \n\n&#8226; Remaining Performance Obligation: Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $63.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year . Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $30.2 billion , an increase of nine percent year-over-year. \n\n&#8226; Share Repurchase Program: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.8 billion. \n\n&#8226; Dividend Program : During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends. \n\nIn the second half of fiscal 2025, we continued seeing increasing momentum for Agentforce and other AI service offerings. Outside of the demand for AI, the buying environment trends seen over the past two fiscal years have stabilized. A reemergence of slower growth in new and renewal business could impact our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets. \n\nIn addition, the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Total revenues in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 were minimally impacted by foreign currency fluctuations compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Our current remaining performance obligatio n growth as of January 31, 2025 compared to January 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by two percent compared to what would have been reported using constant currency rates. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations could impact our near-term results and ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations can also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. \n\nFiscal Year \n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. \n\nOperating Segments \n\nWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \n\nSources of Revenues \n\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2025. \n\nSubscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, &#8220;Cloud Services&#8221;), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year term software licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from term software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2025. \n\nThe revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in &#8220;Results of Operations,&#8221; fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer&#8217;s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer&#8217;s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer&#8217;s business requirements and usage. \n\nOur growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully \n\nintegrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent. \n\nWe continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. \n\nSeasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow \n\nUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter . Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. \n\nRemaining Performance Obligation \n\nOur remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. \n\nRemaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation. \n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses \n\nCost of Revenues \n\nCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#8217;s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations. \n\nCost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers&#8217; success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead. \n\nSales and Marketing &#160; \n\nSales and marketing expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of employee-related costs and commissions for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. As such, the timing of expense recognition for these commissions is not consistent with the timing of the associated cash payment. \n\nOur sales and marketing expenses include amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company&#8217;s trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. \n\nGeneral and Administrative &#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, as well as professional services fees and allocated overhead. \n\nWe allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent, occupancy charges and certain employee benefits based on headcount. As such, these types of expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. \n\nRestructuring \n\nRestructuring consists of charges related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation as well as exit charges associated with office space reductions. Restructuring excludes allocated overhead. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 &#8220;Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment. \n\nCloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer&#8217;s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have generally concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct. \n\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy and historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP. \n\nIn certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography. \n\nBusiness Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. \n\nCritical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are: \n\n&#8226; future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; \n\n&#8226; historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers; \n\n&#8226; assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings; \n\n&#8226; discount rates; \n\n&#8226; uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; \n\n&#8226; fair value of assumed equity awards; and \n\n&#8226; fair value of pre-existing relationships. \n\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \n\nIncome Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. \n\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. \n\nStrategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and these valuations require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing models (&#8220;OPM&#8221;), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity. \n\nWe assess the privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio for impairment quarterly. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Depending on our contractual rights as an investor, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions): ##TABLE_START 4 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2025 % of Total Revenues 2024 % of Total Revenues 2023 % of Total Revenues Revenues: Subscription and support $ 35,679 94 % $ 32,537 93 % $ 29,021 93 % Professional services and other 2,216 6 2,320 7 2,331 7 Total revenues 37,895 100 34,857 100 31,352 100 Cost of revenues (1)(2): Subscription and support 6,198 16 6,177 18 5,821 19 Professional services and other 2,445 7 2,364 7 2,539 8 Total cost of revenues 8,643 23 8,541 25 8,360 27 Gross profit 29,252 77 26,316 75 22,992 73 Operating expenses (1)(2): Research and development 5,493 15 4,906 14 5,055 16 Sales and marketing 13,257 35 12,877 37 13,526 43 General and administrative 2,836 7 2,534 7 2,553 8 Restructuring 461 1 988 3 828 3 Total operating expenses 22,047 58 21,305 61 21,962 70 Income from operations 7,205 19 5,011 14 1,030 3 Losses on strategic investments, net (121) 0 (277) (1) (239) (1) Other income (expense) 354 1 216 1 (131) 0 Income before provision for income taxes 7,438 20 4,950 14 660 2 Provision for income taxes (1,241) (4) (814) (2) (452) (1) Net income $ 6,197 16 % $ 4,136 12 % $ 208 1 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2025 % of Total Revenues 2024 % of Total Revenues 2023 % of Total Revenues Cost of revenues $ 750 2 % $ 978 3 % $ 1,035 3 % Sales and marketing 901 2 891 2 916 3 ##TABLE_END\n\n(2) Amounts related to stock-based compensation expense, as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2025 % of Total Revenues 2024 % of Total Revenues 2023 % of Total Revenues Cost of revenues $ 518 1 % $ 431 1 % $ 499 2 % Research and development 1,091 3 972 3 1,136 3 Sales and marketing 1,205 3 1,062 3 1,256 4 General and administrative 367 1 299 1 368 1 Restructuring 2 0 23 0 20 0 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions): ##TABLE_START As of January 31, 2025 \n\nJanuary 31, 2024 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 14,032 $ 14,194 Unearned revenue 20,743 19,003 Remaining performance obligation 63.4 56.9 Principal due on our outstanding debt obligations (1) 8,500 9,500 ##TABLE_END (1) Amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations. \n\nRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2025 and 2024 \n\nRevenues \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance (in millions) 2025 2024 Dollars Percent Subscription and support $ 35,679 $ 32,537 $ 3,142 10 % Professional services and other 2,216 2,320 (104) (4) % Total revenues $ 37,895 $ 34,857 $ 3,038 9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2025 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. Revenues from term software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represented approximately six percent and seven percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent and 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n\nThe decrease in professional services and other revenues for fiscal 2025 was due primarily to less demand for larger, multi-year transformation engagements and, in some cases, delayed projects. These trends may continue in the near term. \n\nSubscription and Support Revenues by Service Offering \n\nSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2025 As a % of Total Subscription and Support Revenues 2024 As a % of Total Subscription and Support Revenues Growth Rate Sales $ 8,322 23 % $ 7,580 23 % 10 % Service 9,054 25 8,245 25 10 Platform and Other 7,247 21 6,611 21 10 Marketing and Commerce 5,281 15 4,912 15 8 Integration and Analytics 5,775 16 5,189 16 11 Total $ 35,679 100 % $ 32,537 100 % 10 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOur industry vertical service offerings revenue is included in one of the above service offerings depending on the primary service purchased. \n\nIntegration and Analytics subscription and support revenues include revenues from term software licenses, which are recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Therefore, we expect Integration and Analytics to experience greater volatility in revenues period to period compared to our other service offerings and recent revenue trends may not be indicative of future performance. Additionally, as we transition customers within the Integration and Analytics offering from term software licenses to subscription based services, revenue associated with such customers will generally be recognized ratably over the contract term, which we expect may potentially result in less revenue in the period the customer transitions but incremental revenues over the remaining term. \n\nRevenues by Geography \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, (in millions) 2025 As a % of Total Revenues 2024 As a % of Total Revenues Growth Rate Americas $ 25,143 66 % $ 23,289 67 % 8 % Europe 8,891 24 8,128 23 9 Asia Pacific 3,861 10 3,440 10 12 Total $ 37,895 100 % $ 34,857 100 % 9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. The increase in revenues across all regions was primarily due to the continued execution of our business and growth strategy, including increasing our geographic reach primarily through extending our go-to-market capabilities globally. Foreign currency did not contribute materially to the year over year fluctuations in revenue. \n\nCost of Revenues \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in millions) 2025 As a % of Total Revenues 2024 As a % of Total Revenues \n\nSubscription and support $ 6,198 16 % $ 6,177 18 % $ 21 Professional services and other 2,445 7 % 2,364 7 % 81 Total cost of revenues $ 8,643 23 % $ 8,541 25 % $ 102 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles and a decrease in service delivery expenses. Our cost of revenues headcount increased by seven percent during fiscal 2025, primarily in lower cost regions. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 decreased by two percent from the same period a year ago primarily due to our total revenues growth outpacing our cost of revenues growth. \n\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in enterprise cloud computing services to allow us to scale with our customers and continue to evolve our security measures. The timing of these expenses, which also includes the use of AI and agents, may cause our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to fluctuate over time due to changes in demand for our service offerings. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in millions) 2025 As a % of Total Revenues 2024 As a % of Total Revenues Research and development $ 5,493 15 % $ 4,906 14 % $ 587 Sales and marketing 13,257 35 12,877 37 380 General and administrative 2,836 7 2,534 7 302 Restructuring 461 1 988 3 (527) Total operating expenses $ 22,047 58 % $ 21,305 61 % $ 742 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 increased by one percent from the same period a year ago primarily due to an increase in relative employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development headcount increased by 13 percent during fiscal 2025, primarily in lower cost regions. \n\nWe expect that research and development expenses will likely remain consistent as a percentage of revenue over time as we continue to invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies, including AI, agents and our Data Cloud service offerings, and the integration of acquired technologies. \n\nFor fiscal 2025, the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 decreased by two percent from the same period a year ago due to a decrease in relative employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense and advertising expense. Our sales and marketing headcount increased by one percent during fiscal 2025, primarily in lower cost regions. \n\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses may decrease as a percentage of revenues over time as we continue to focus on leveraging our self-serve and partner-led channels and increasing our sales productivity, which includes the use of AI and agents. \n\nFor fiscal 2025, the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and professional services expenses. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 was consistent with the same period a year ago. Our general and administrative headcount increased by three percent during fiscal 2025. \n\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses may decrease as a percentage of revenues over time as we continue to invest in process efficiency initiatives, which includes the use of AI and agents. \n\nIn fiscal 2025, approximately $461 million of costs were incurred related to our restructuring initiatives, which was primarily related to employee transitions, severance payments and employee benefits. We do not expect to incur significant additional charges in connection with our restructuring initiatives in the near term. \n\nOther Income and Expenses ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in millions) 2025 2024 Losses on strategic investments, net $ (121) $ (277) $ 156 Other income 354 216 138 ##TABLE_END\n\nLosses on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments including impairments. Our strategic investment portfolio continues to be affected by challenging market conditions for companies in which we hold private equity, debt or other investments, as well as high public equity market volatility. In fiscal 2025 these factors resulted in impairments on privately-held equity and debt securities of $582 million, partially offset by $358 million in unrealized gains on privately held equity securities. \n\nOther income primarily consists of interest income on our marketable securities portfolio, which is partially offset by interest expense on our debt as well as our finance leases. Other income increased in fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase in investment income from higher interest rates. \n\nProvision For Income Taxes \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in millions) 2025 2024 Provision for income taxes $ (1,241) $ (814) $ (427) Effective tax rate 17 % 16 % ##TABLE_END\n\nWe recorded a tax provision of $1.2 billion on pretax income of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2025. Our tax provision increased from a year ago primarily due to higher pretax income. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in our domestic and foreign earnings, or material discrete tax items, or a combination of these factors resulting from transactions or events, including acquisitions, changes to our operating structure and other macroeconomic factors. \n\nSeveral countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#8217;s 15% global minimum tax regime effective January 1, 2024. There was no material impact to our income tax provision for fiscal 2025. We continue to evaluate the impacts of legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payment could increase in future years. \n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 \n\nFor a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2024 compared to the year ended January 31, 2023, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nAt January 31, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $14.0 billion and accounts receivable of $11.9 billion. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Our Revolving Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below), which provides the ability to borrow up to $5.0 billion in unsecured financing (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) as of January 31, 2025, also serves as a source of liquidity. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted noncancellable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months and thereafter. \n\nIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments. \n\nCash Flows \n\nFor fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 our cash flows were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START 4 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2025 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,092 $ 10,234 $ 7,111 Net cash used in investing activities (3,163) (1,327) (1,989) Net cash used in financing activities (9,429) (7,477) (3,562) ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was primarily comprised of net income of $6.2 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including $3.5 billion of depreciation and amortization and $3.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was further benefited by the changes in unearned revenue of $1.6 billion and accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1.1 billion, partially offset by the changes in costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, net of $2.1 billion, prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets of $1.5 billion and accounts receivable, net of $490 million. As our business continues to grow, and assuming our expenses remain in line with or less than our revenue growth, we expect to continue to see growth in net cash provided by operating activities. \n\nThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily comprised of net income of $4.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including $4.0 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 billion of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 was further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $1.6 billion, partially offset by the changes in accounts receivable, net of $659 million and the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $478 million. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 was primarily related to net outflows for acquisitions of $2.7 billion, net outflows from strategic investment activity of $413 million and capital expenditures of $658 million, partially offset by net inflows from marketable securities activity of $642 million. \n\nThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $736 million, net outflows from strategic investment activity of $388 million, and net outflows related to marketable securities activity of $121 million. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nThe net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2025 was primarily related to $7.8 billion used for repurchases of common stock, $1.5 billion related to payments of dividends and $1.0 billion related to repayments of debt, partially offset by $1.5 billion from proceeds from equity plans. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2024 was primarily related to $7.6 billion from repurchases of common stock and $1.2 billion related to repayments of debt, partially offset by $2.0 billion from proceeds from equity plans. \n\nDebt \n\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding, with maturities starting in April 2028 and extending through July 2061 with a total carrying value of $8.4 billion. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2025. \n\nIn October 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement with the lenders and issuing lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the &#8220;Revolving Loan Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement replaced the Credit Agreement, dated December 23, 2020 (as amended, the &#8220;Prior Credit Agreement&#8221;), among us, the lenders and the issuing lenders party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, which provided for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on December 23, 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement. \n\nThe Revolving Loan Credit Agreement provides for a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) and matures in October 2029. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025. \n\nWe do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nIn August 2022, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock (the &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221;). The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. In February 2023, the Board authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2024, the Board authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate total authorization of $30.0 billion. \n\nWe repurchased the following under the Share Repurchase Program (in millions, except average price per share): ##TABLE_START 2025 2024 2023 Shares Average price per share Amount Shares Average price per share Amount Shares Average price per share Amount Fiscal year ended January 31 30 $ 260.12 $ 7,757 36 $ 210.30 $ 7,674 28 $ 144.94 $ 4,000 ##TABLE_END\n\nAll repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of January 31, 2025, we were authorized to purchase a remaining $10.6 billion of the Company&#8217;s common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. Subsequent to January 31, 2025, we have incurred approximately $535 million through February 28, 2025 for additional shares under the Share Repurchase Program. \n\nDividends \n\nWe announced the following dividends (in millions, except dividend per share): \n\n##TABLE_START Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Share Amount March 14, 2024 April 11, 2024 $ 0.40 $ 388 July 9, 2024 July 25, 2024 $ 0.40 $ 388 September 18, 2024 October 8, 2024 $ 0.40 $ 385 December 18, 2024 January 9, 2025 $ 0.40 $ 388 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe declaration and payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, after giving consideration to continued capital availability, general economic and market conditions, and applicable laws and agreements. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. As of January 31, 2025, the future noncancellable minimum payments under these commitments were approximately $4.0 billion, with payments of $1.0 billion due in the next 12 months and $3.0 billion due thereafter. In addition to our leasing arrangements, we have other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, including those with infrastructure service providers. As of January 31, 2025 our total commitments under these agreements were approximately $17.3 billion, of which payments of $2.8 billion are due in the next 12 months and $14.5 billion are due thereafter. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. \n\nDuring fiscal 2025 and in future years, we have made, and expect to continue to make, additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations to increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. While we continue to make investments in our infrastructure and with infrastructure service providers to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of our investments. \n\nOther Future Obligations \n\nAs of January 31, 2025, we expect approximately $300 million to $325 million in future cash payments related to our restructuring initiatives, primarily related to workforce costs such as severance payments. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. \n\nStakeholder Impact \n\nWe believe that business is the greatest platform for change. Guided by our values, we work to earn the trust of our stakeholders. Transparency is key to trust, which is why we have published an annual Stakeholder Impact Report for over ten years to keep our stakeholders informed and to hold ourselves accountable to our sustainability, impact and equality strategies. Our disclosures in these areas are also informed by topics identified through relevancy assessments and third-party ESG reporting organizations, frameworks and standards, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;SASB&#8221;) Standards.
