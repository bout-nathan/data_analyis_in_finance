MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following MD&#38;A is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen&#8217;s business. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&#38;A are presented in conformity with GAAP. Amgen operates in one operating segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. \n\nForward-looking statements \n\nThis report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management&#8217;s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases, written statements or our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;assume&#8221; and &#8220;continue&#8221; as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management&#8217;s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, EPS, liquidity and capital resources, trends, planned dividends, stock repurchases and collaborations. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. \n\nOverview \n\nAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as &#8220;Amgen,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines to fight some of the world&#8217;s toughest diseases. We focus on areas of high unmet medical need and leverage our expertise to strive for solutions that dramatically improve people&#8217;s lives, while also reducing the social and economic burden of disease. We helped launch the biotechnology industry more than 40 years ago and have grown to be one of the world&#8217;s leading independent biotechnology companies. Our robust pipeline includes potential first-in-class medicines at all stages of development. \n\nOur principal products are Prolia, ENBREL, XGEVA, Repatha, Otezla, TEPEZZA, EVENITY, KYPROLIS, Nplate, Aranesp, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA, Vectibix and TEZSPIRE. We also market a number of other products, including but not limited to AMJEVITA/AMGEVITA, MVASI, Neulasta, RAVICTI, UPLIZNA, Parsabiv, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Aimovig, TAVNEOS, PROCYSBI, EPOGEN and IMDELLTRA. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. \n\nOur strategy is the integrated set of actions we take to improve our competitive position in the industry. In 2024, we advanced our innovative pipeline; generated strong sales growth across our product portfolio and regions; and expanded our world-class manufacturing network. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation. \n\nWe received regulatory approvals for BLINCYTO in CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL and IMDELLTRA in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and reported five Phase 3 data readouts, including for BLINCYTO, UPLIZNA, rocatinlimab and TEZSPIRE, as well as MariTide Phase 2 top-line results. For more information on our pipeline and clinical development updates, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates, and Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Significant Developments. \n\nTotal product sales increased in 2024, primarily driven by volume growth of 23%, partially offset by declines in net selling price of 2%. Product sales from acquired Horizon products contributed $4.2 billion in 2024 compared to $954 million in 2023, with volume growth from our other brands of 11%. \n\nCash flows from operating activities in 2024 totaled $11.5 billion, which supported investment in our business, including capital expenditures of $1.1 billion to enhance and expand our manufacturing network, and allowed us to both reduce our debt outstanding and return capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. For 2024, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $2.25 per share of common stock. In December 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of \n\n$2.38 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 6% over the same period in the prior year, to be paid in March 2025. \n\nAmgen&#8217;s approach to and investment in human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and align with the interests of the Company&#8217;s shareholders. In our effort to attract and retain the best talent, we seek out and support talent across the globe. Further, we believe that an inclusive culture helps attract and retain a strong and engaged workforce informed by the varied backgrounds and experiences represented, which fosters innovation, collaboration and productivity as we execute on our mission to serve patients. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Human Capital Resources. \n\nWe have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%. 2,3 \n\nOur long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must grow sales from existing and new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses caused by products&#8217; loss of their exclusivity or launches of competing products. For example, our patents for RANKL antibodies, including sequences, for Prolia and XGEVA expire in February 2025 in the United States and in November 2025 in select countries in Europe. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&#38;D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. \n\nMacroeconomic and other challenges \n\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, including the risk of inflation, tariffs or trade protection measures, higher interest rates and instability in the financial system, as well as rising healthcare costs, continue to pose challenges to our business. Further, ongoing geopolitical conflicts continue to create additional uncertainty in global macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, with public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to be subject to cost containment measures and significant pricing pressures, resulting in net price declines. Moreover, provisions of the IRA, as well as the 340B Program, have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. For example, ENBREL and Otezla have been selected by CMS for Medicare price setting beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These buying patterns can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales, but have generally not been significant to date when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products, and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product sales. \n\n2 Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the Company. \n\n3 Carbon neutrality goal refers to Scopes 1 and 2. \n\nSelected Financial Information \n\nThe following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per-share data): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2024 Change Year ended December 31, 2023 Product sales: U.S. $ 23,301 21 % $ 19,272 ROW 8,725 14 % 7,638 Total product sales 32,026 19 % 26,910 Other revenues 1,398 9 % 1,280 Total revenues $ 33,424 19 % $ 28,190 Operating expenses $ 26,166 29 % $ 20,293 Operating income $ 7,258 (8) % $ 7,897 Net income $ 4,090 (39) % $ 6,717 Diluted EPS $ 7.56 (39) % $ 12.49 Diluted shares 541 1 % 538 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to volume growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers (such as physicians or their clinics), dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies). \n\nTotal product sales increased 19% in 2024, primarily driven by volume growth of 23%, partially offset by declines in net selling price of 2%. U.S. volume grew 26% and ROW volume grew 17%. Product sales from acquired Horizon products contributed $4.2 billion in 2024 compared to $954 million in 2023, with volume growth of 11% from our other brands, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, BLINCYTO and Prolia. \n\nFor 2025, we expect volume growth from certain brands to be partially offset by net selling price declines. Further, the first quarter of a year historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for products acquired through pharmacy benefit programs. \n\nUncertain macroeconomic conditions, changes in the healthcare ecosystem and geopolitical conflicts have the potential to introduce variability into product sales. Furthermore, product sales continue to be impacted by actions from governments and other entities to curb high inflation, provisions of the IRA, inappropriate expanded utilization of the 340B Program and growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. \n\nOther revenues increased for 2024, primarily driven by higher corporate partner revenue from licensed products and royalty income. \n\nOperating expenses increased for 2024, driven by higher amortization expense from Horizon acquisition-related assets, higher R&#38;D and SG&#38;A expenses, including expenses from the acquired Horizon business, and higher profit share and royalty expense. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nProduct sales \n\nWorldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2024 Change Year ended December 31, 2023 Change Year ended December 31, 2022 Prolia $ 4,374 8 % $ 4,048 12 % $ 3,628 ENBREL 3,316 (10) % 3,697 (10) % 4,117 XGEVA 2,225 5 % 2,112 5 % 2,014 Repatha 2,222 36 % 1,635 26 % 1,296 Otezla 2,126 (3) % 2,188 (4) % 2,288 \n\nTEPEZZA (1) \n\n1,851 * 448 N/A &#8212; EVENITY 1,563 35 % 1,160 47 % 787 KYPROLIS 1,503 7 % 1,403 13 % 1,247 Nplate 1,456 (1) % 1,477 13 % 1,307 Aranesp 1,342 (1) % 1,362 (4) % 1,421 BLINCYTO 1,216 41 % 861 48 % 583 \n\nKRYSTEXXA (1) \n\n1,185 * 272 N/A &#8212; Vectibix 1,045 6 % 984 10 % 893 TEZSPIRE 972 71 % 567 * 170 \n\nOther products (2) \n\n5,630 20 % 4,696 (7) % 5,050 Total product sales $ 32,026 19 % $ 26,910 9 % $ 24,801 Total U.S. $ 23,301 21 % $ 19,272 9 % $ 17,743 Total ROW 8,725 14 % 7,638 8 % 7,058 Total product sales $ 32,026 19 % $ 26,910 9 % $ 24,801 ##TABLE_END\n\n* Change in excess of 100% \n\nN/A = not applicable \n\n____________ \n\n(1) TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA were acquired from our Horizon acquisition on October 6, 2023, and include product sales in the periods after the acquisition date. \n\n(2) Consists of product sales of our non-principal products. \n\nFuture sales of our products will depend in part on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Competition, Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Reimbursement, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products&#8217; significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Competition. \n\nProlia \n\nTotal Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2024 Change Year ended December 31, 2023 Change Year ended December 31, 2022 Prolia &#8212; U.S. $ 2,885 6 % $ 2,733 11 % $ 2,465 Prolia &#8212; ROW 1,489 13 % 1,315 13 % 1,163 Total Prolia $ 4,374 8 % $ 4,048 12 % $ 3,628 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in global Prolia sales for 2024 was driven by volume growth. \n\nThe increase in global Prolia sales for 2023 was primarily driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. \n\nAs disclosed in Part I, Item 1. Business&#8212;Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products&#8212;Patents, our patents for RANKL antibodies, including sequences, for Prolia expire in February 2025 in the United States and in November 2025 in select countries in Europe. For 2025, we expect sales erosion driven by biosimilar competition. \n\nFor a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Prolia, see Part IV&#8212;Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nENBREL \n\nTotal ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2024 Change Year ended December 31, 2023 Change Year ended December 31, 2022 ENBREL &#8212; U.S. $ 3,288 (10) % $ 3,650 (10) % $ 4,044 ENBREL &#8212; Canada 28 (40) % 47 (36) % 73 Total ENBREL $ 3,316 (10) % $ 3,697 (10) % $ 4,117 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2024 was driven by lower net selling price. For 2025, we expect ENBREL to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, going forward, we expect relatively flat volumes with continued declines in net selling price, including the impact from the IRA Medicare Part D price set by CMS beginning in 2026. \n\nThe decrease in ENBREL sales for 2023 was driven by lower net selling price, lower inventory and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. \n\nXGEVA \n\nTotal XGEVA sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2024 Change Year ended December 31, 2023 Change Year ended December 31, 2022 XGEVA &#8212; U.S. $ 1,507 (1) % $ 1,527 3 % $ 1,480 XGEVA &#8212; ROW 718 23 % 585 10 % 534 Total XGEVA $ 2,225 5 % $ 2,112 5 % $ 2,014 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increases in global XGEVA sales for 2024 and 2023 were driven by higher net selling price. \n\nAs disclosed in Part I, Item 1.

For 2025, we expect Otezla to follow the historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In January 2025, Otezla was selected by CMS for Medicare price setting that will be applicable beginning on January 1, 2027. \n\nThe decrease in global Otezla sales for 2023 was driven by lower net selling price and inventory, partially offset by volume growth. \n\nTEPEZZA \n\nTotal TEPEZZA sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2024 Change Year ended December 31, 2023 Change Year ended December 31, 2022 TEPEZZA &#8212; U.S. $ 1,835 * $ 441 N/A $ &#8212; TEPEZZA &#8212; ROW 16 * 7 N/A &#8212; Total TEPEZZA $ 1,851 * $ 448 N/A $ &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\n* Change in excess of 100% \n\nN/A = not applicable \n\nTEPEZZA was acquired on October 6, 2023 from our Horizon acquisition and generated $1.9 billion and $448 million in product sales for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

For 2024, the unfavorable impact from product sales mix of certain Amgen products was offset by the favorable impact on product sales mix of the addition of acquired Horizon products. See Part IV&#8212;Note 4, Acquisitions and divestitures, and Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCost of sales increased to 30.0% of total revenues for 2023, driven by higher amortization expense from acquisition-related assets primarily associated with the Horizon acquisition, higher profit share and royalty expense and changes in our product sales mix, partially offset by the impact of the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change. \n\nResearch and development \n\nThe Company groups all of its R&#38;D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products.

Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained ##TABLE_END\n\nR&#38;D expense by category was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Research and early pipeline $ 1,534 $ 1,584 $ 1,611 Later-stage clinical programs 2,830 1,898 1,627 Marketed products 1,600 1,302 1,196 Total R&#38;D expense $ 5,964 $ 4,784 $ 4,434 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2024 was driven by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed product support, including Horizon-acquired programs. We expect to continue to grow our spend on later-stage clinical programs as we advance our pipeline. \n\nThe increase in R&#38;D expense for 2023 was driven by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed product support, including Horizon-acquired programs. \n\nSelling, general and administrative \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2024 was primarily driven by expenses from the acquired Horizon business and other commercial expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses related to the Horizon acquisition incurred in 2024. \n\nThe increase in SG&#38;A expense for 2023 was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses, in addition to commercial and general and administrative expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by lower spend for other marketed products. \n\nOther \n\nOther operating expenses for 2024 primarily consisted of impairment charges associated with IPR&#38;D intangible assets related to our Teneobio acquisition in 2021 and expenses related to cost-savings initiatives incurred in 2024. \n\nOther operating expenses for 2023 primarily consisted of a net IPR&#38;D intangible asset impairment charge for AMG 340 and expenses related to our restructuring plan that were both initiated and substantially completed in 2023. \n\nOther operating expenses for 2022 primarily consisted of a loss on the divestiture of Gensenta. \n\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes \n\nNonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Interest expense, net $ (3,155) $ (2,875) $ (1,406) Other income (expense), net $ 506 $ 2,833 $ (814) Provision for income taxes $ 519 $ 1,138 $ 794 Effective tax rate 11.3 % 14.5 % 10.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest expense, net \n\nThe increases in Interest expense, net, in 2024 and 2023 over the respective prior years were primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher weighted-average fixed and floating interest rates on the debt. See Part IV&#8212;Note 16, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOther income (expense), net \n\nThe change in Other income (expense), net, for 2024 was primarily due to current year net unrealized losses on our strategic equity investments compared with net unrealized gains in the prior year, as well as reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances. The 2023 net unrealized gains on our strategic equity investments were principally composed of amounts recognized on our BeiGene investment in the first quarter of 2023 as a result of a change from the equity method of accounting to recording this investment at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. See Part IV&#8212;Note 10, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe change in Other income (expense), net, for 2023 was primarily due to gains recognized in connection with recording our BeiGene investment at fair value and an increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates as compared to the prior year. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2024 compared with 2023 was primarily due to a change in earnings mix, including the net unrealized impact of our strategic equity investments, partially offset by the deferred tax adjustments associated with U.S. minimum tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. \n\nAs previously reported, the OECD reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. As of January 1, 2025, select individual countries, including the United Kingdom, EU member countries and Singapore, have enacted the global minimum tax agreement. Our legal entities in the countries that have enacted the agreement, along with their direct and indirect subsidiaries, are now subject to a 15% minimum tax rate on adjusted financial statement income. Other countries, including the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, have not yet enacted the OECD agreement and implementation remains highly uncertain. The continued enactment of the agreement, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, could result in tax increases or double taxation in the United States or foreign jurisdictions. \n\nA 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change replaced the excise tax with an income tax, beginning in 2023. As of January 1, 2023, we are no longer subject to a 4% excise tax in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico. We qualify for and are subject to the alternative income tax rate on industrial development income of our Puerto Rico affiliate. In the United States, this income tax qualifies for foreign tax credits under the U.S. Treasury final foreign tax credit regulations. See Part IV&#8212;Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010&#8211;2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010&#8211;2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010&#8211;2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010&#8211;2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. \n\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013&#8211;2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010&#8211;2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013&#8211;2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013&#8211;2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013&#8211;2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. \n\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010&#8211;2012 and 2013&#8211;2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010&#8211;2012 and 2013&#8211;2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024 and concluded on January 17, 2025. With the conclusion of the trial, the parties will file post-trial briefs and make closing arguments in 2025. The Company expects a decision from the U.S. Tax Court no earlier than 2026. \n\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016&#8211;2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We believe that the IRS may also seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for years beyond 2018. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions. \n\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; We could be subject to additional tax liabilities, including from an adverse outcome in our ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and other tax examinations, enactment of the OECD minimum corporate tax rate agreement and the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation, and we anticipate additional tax liabilities from certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act that will go into effect in 2026; such tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations; Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis or Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Income taxes; and Part IV&#8212;Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nSelected financial data was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2024 2023 \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\n$ 11,973 $ 10,944 Total assets $ 91,839 $ 97,154 Current portion of long-term debt $ 3,550 $ 1,443 Long-term debt $ 56,549 $ 63,170 Stockholders&#8217; equity $ 5,877 $ 6,232 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents was $12.0 billion on December 31, 2024. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. \n\nCapital allocation \n\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including investments in innovation both internally and externally (including investments that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), capital expenditures, repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. \n\nWe intend to continue investing in our business while reducing our debt and returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. This reflects our desire to optimize our cost of capital and our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, debt levels and debt service requirements, our credit rating, availability of financing on acceptable terms, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company&#8217;s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, ASRs and market transactions. \n\nThe Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $2.25, $2.13 and $1.94 per share of common stock paid in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 6% and 10% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. In December 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $2.38 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 6% over the same period in the prior year, to be paid in March 2025. \n\nWe also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2024, we repurchased $200 million of common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2023, we did not repurchase any of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2022, we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock, including $6.0 billion under ASR agreements and had cash settlements for stock repurchases of $6.4 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $6.8 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. \n\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position. \n\nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements as well as our plans to reduce debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities, and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business . \n\nFinancing arrangements \n\nTo help meet our liquidity requirements, we have entered into various financing arrangements. The noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $56.5 billion and $63.2 billion, respectively. The carrying values of our long-term borrowings are net of fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, premiums and offering costs. As of December 31, 2024, S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s and Fitch assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of BBB+, Baa1 and BBB, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. \n\nIn December 2022, in connection with the acquisition of Horizon, we entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan credit agreement, which provided for borrowings in the aggregate of $28.5 billion. During 2023, we issued $24.0 billion of debt composed of eight series of notes, terminated the bridge credit agreement and borrowed $4.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement, of which $1.8 billion of borrowings was outstanding as of December 31, 2024. During 2022, we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 billion. \n\nDuring 2024, debt repayments totaled $3.6 billion, of which $2.2 billion was composed of repayments on our term loans. During 2023, debt repayments totaled $1.5 billion, and we had no debt repayments in 2022. In addition, we opportunistically repurchase our debt when market conditions are favorable. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased aggregate principal amounts of our debt of $875 million, $881 million and $378 million, respectively, for aggregate costs of $659 million, $647 million and $297 million, respectively, which resulted in the recognition of gains on extinguishment of debt of $215 million, $225 million and $78 million, respectively, recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nTo achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating, SOFR-based coupon over the terms of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.7 billion. \n\nTo hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2.7 billion. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our commercial paper program allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \n\nIn 2023, we amended and restated our syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, under which we may borrow up to $4.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including as a liquidity backstop for our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $1.25 billion with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) SOFR plus 1.01% or (ii) the highest of (A) the administrative agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month SOFR plus 1.1%. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. \n\nAlso in 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time, with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2026. \n\nCertain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the respective agreements. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2024. \n\nThese financing arrangements are more fully discussed in Part IV&#8212;Note 16, Financing arrangements, and Note 19, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCash flows \n\nOur summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, 2024 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,490 $ 8,471 $ 9,721 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,046) $ (26,204) $ (6,044) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (9,415) $ 21,048 $ (4,037) ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating \n\nCash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to higher net income after adjustments for noncash items and timing of working capital items primarily driven by higher collections in the fourth quarter. \n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to lower net income after adjustments for noncash items, primarily transaction and integration payments made in connection with the Horizon acquisition, as well as higher tax payments, partially offset by changes in working capital items. \n\nInvesting \n\nCash used in investing activities during 2024 was primarily due to $1.1 billion of capital expenditures, including construction costs for new plants in North Carolina and Ohio. \n\nCash used in investing activities during 2023 was primarily due to $27.0 billion of net cash used for the purchase of Horizon and $1.1 billion of capital expenditures, partially offset by net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $1.7 billion. \n\nCash used in investing activities during 2022 was primarily due to our $3.8 billion purchase of ChemoCentryx, net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.4 billion and $936 million of capital expenditures. \n\nWe currently estimate 2025 investments in capital projects to be approximately $2.3 billion. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates. \n\nFinancing \n\nCash used in financing activities during 2024 was primarily due to the payment of dividends of $4.8 billion, the repayment and extinguishment of debt of $3.6 billion and $659 million, respectively, and payments to repurchase our common stock of $200 million. \n\nCash provided by financing activities during 2023 was primarily due to net proceeds from long-term debt issuances of $27.8 billion primarily in connection with the acquisition of Horizon, partially offset by the payment of dividends of $4.6 billion and the repayment and extinguishment of debt of $1.5 billion and $647 million, respectively. \n\nCash used in financing activities during 2022 was primarily due to payments to repurchase our common stock of $6.4 billion and the payment of dividends of $4.2 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $6.9 billion. \n\nSee Part IV&#8212;Note 10, Investments; Note 16, Financing arrangements; and Note 17, Stockholders&#8217; equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCapital requirements \n\nWe have material cash requirements to pay third parties under various contractual obligations discussed below. \n\nWe are obligated to pay interest and repay principal under our various financing arrangements, including amounts under interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts related to certain of our long-term debt obligations. For information on scheduled debt maturities and payments under derivative contracts associated with our long-term debt obligations, see Part IV&#8212;Note 16, Financing arrangements, and Note 19, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nWe are obligated to make payments for operating leases, including rental commitments on abandoned leases and leases that have not yet commenced. For information on these obligations, see Part IV&#8212;Note 14, Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nUnder the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations, of which the final installment will be paid in 2025. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have purchase obligations of $5.7 billion primarily related to (i) R&#38;D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. \n\nIn addition to the purchase obligations noted above and upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that, in the aggregate, are significant. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes. Except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration of approximately $106 million as of December 31, 2024, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $5.6 billion. \n\nWe have recorded liabilities for UTBs that, because of their nature, have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payment and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV&#8212;Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are included in Part IV&#8212;Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following are considered critical to our consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. \n\nProduct sales and sales deductions \n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) established at the time of sale. \n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions Total Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 4,147 $ 797 $ 230 $ 5,174 Amounts charged against product sales 12,500 10,630 2,288 25,418 Payments (11,768) (10,578) (2,260) (24,606) Balance as of December 31, 2022 4,879 849 258 5,986 Additions (1) \n\n263 24 39 326 Amounts charged against product sales 14,328 13,349 2,533 30,210 Payments (13,634) (13,125) (2,492) (29,251) Balance as of December 31, 2023 5,836 1,097 338 7,271 Amounts charged against product sales 17,404 14,882 3,060 35,346 Payments (16,423) (14,817) (2,972) (34,212) Balance as of December 31, 2024 $ 6,817 $ 1,162 $ 426 $ 8,405 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________ \n\n(1) Represents sales deductions assumed from the Horizon acquisition. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total sales deductions were 52%, 53% and 51% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by higher gross sales. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. \n\nIn the United States, we use wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions. \n\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold. \n\nRebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs and those related to the IRA, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on \n\nthe product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. \n\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. \n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, when appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. See Part IV&#8212;Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCertain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in tax returns in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, because future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. \n\nAmgen is subject to current U.S. minimum tax on foreign subsidiaries. Based on our election beginning in 2022, we have established deferred taxes with respect to the U.S. minimum tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. This requires us to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. These are ongoing adjustments that are likely to occur in the future. \n\nWe are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In the jurisdictions where we conduct operations, we are subject to income tax based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and on the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and the risks assumed in each location, as well as on the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2050. \n\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010&#8211;2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010&#8211;2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010&#8211;2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of \n\napproximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010&#8211;2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. \n\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013&#8211;2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010&#8211;2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013&#8211;2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013&#8211;2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013&#8211;2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. \n\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010&#8211;2012 and 2013&#8211;2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010&#8211;2012 and 2013&#8211;2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024, and concluded on January 17, 2025. With the conclusion of the trial, the parties will file post-trial briefs and make closing arguments in 2025. The Company expects a decision from the Tax Court no earlier than 2026. \n\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016&#8211;2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We believe that the IRS may also seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for years beyond 2018. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions. \n\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not li kely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; We could be subject to additional tax liabilities, including from an adverse outcome in our ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and other tax examinations, enactment of the OECD minimum corporate tax rate agreement and the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation, and we anticipate additional tax liabilities from certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act that will go into effect in 2026; such tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations; Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations, Income taxes; and Part IV&#8212;Note 7, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; We could be subject to additional tax liabilities, including from an adverse outcome in our ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and other tax examinations, enactment of the OECD minimum corporate tax rate agreement and the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation, and we anticipate additional tax liabilities from certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Act that will go into effect in 2026; such tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. \n\nContingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV&#8212;Note 20, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. \n\nWhile it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\nValuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions \n\nWe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&#38;D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV&#8212;Note 4, Acquisitions and divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: \n\n&#8226; determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; \n\n&#8226; projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; \n\n&#8226; estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and \n\n&#8226; developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. \n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the business combination date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included but were not limited to the timing and probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. \n\nWe believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. \n\nImpairment of long-lived assets \n\nWe review the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset&#8217;s fair value and its carrying value. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&#38;D projects acquired in a business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition, are reviewed for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. We test for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference, and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. \n\nEstimating future cash flows of an IPR&#38;D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&#38;D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&#38;D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&#38;D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards \n\nSee Part IV&#8212;Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. \n\n##TABLE_START "}
