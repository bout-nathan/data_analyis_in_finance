We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world&#8217;s largest nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. \n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company&#8217;s consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 65 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day. \n\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. \n\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations. \n\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as &#8220;beverage bases,&#8221; syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our &#8220;bottlers&#8221; or our &#8220;bottling partners&#8221;). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment. \n\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company&#8217;s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment. \n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Concentrate operations 59 &#160; % 58 % Finished product operations 41 &#160; 42 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Concentrate operations 85 &#160; % 83 % Finished product operations 15 &#160; 17 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions (including international conflicts), local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises. \n\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: shaping a portfolio of loved brands; transforming our marketing and innovation agenda; optimizing the Coca-Cola ecosystem; building talent and capabilities; and enhancing our license to operate. \n\nChallenges and Risks \n\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below. \n\nObesity \n\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity, which may present a challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution. \n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers&#8217; lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to do the following: \n\n&#8226; offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options; \n\n&#8226; provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages; \n\n&#8226; provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and \n\n&#8226; market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13. \n\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners and flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. \n\nEvolving Consumer Product Preferences \n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; investing in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website. \n\nEvolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace \n\nOur Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our brands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital. \n\nProduct Safety and Quality \n\nWe strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns regarding certain ingredients used in our products. We only use ingredients that are authorized for use by regulatory authorities in each of the markets in which we operate. The Coca-Cola system works every day to produce high-quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to satisfy consumers&#8217; evolving needs and preferences. \n\nWe work to ensure consistent product safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, our operations, contract manufacturers and bottling partners manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of our finished products. \n\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are sold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain. \n\nSustainability Matters \n\nInvestors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters. We acknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions that help build resilience across our business. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and aspirations is dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, some of which are outside of our control. \n\nTalent Acquisition and Retention \n\nCompetition for existing and prospective talent has increased, especially considering changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of qualified talent, which has further increased competition for specialized talent that we want and may require for our future business needs. \n\nOur people and our culture are critical business priorities, and we strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and retains high-performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference. We are committed to building an inclusive culture that inspires and supports the growth of our employees, serves our communities and shapes a strong and more sustainable business. \n\nSee &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n\n&#8226; Principles of Consolidation \n\n&#8226; Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\n&#8226; Pension Plan Valuations \n\n&#8226; Revenue Recognition \n\n&#8226; Income Taxes \n\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity&#8217;s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is referred to as a &#8220;VIE.&#8221; An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs&#8217; economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as consolidated entities. \n\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions. \n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. \n\nRecoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading &#8220;Our Business &#8212; Challenges and Risks&#8221; above and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I of this report as well as the heading &#8220;Operations Review&#8221; below for additional information related to our present business environment. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing impairment tests of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets in various regions around the world. The performance of impairment tests involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, long-term growth rates, discount rates, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. The variability of these factors \n\ndepends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. As these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. \n\nEquity Method Investments \n\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. The fair values of most of our Company&#8217;s investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management&#8217;s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management&#8217;s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairment charges, if applicable. \n\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nImpairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. When performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management&#8217;s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. \n\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. \n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do&#287;adan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. \n\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The assumptions used in our impairment testing models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment. \n\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable. \n\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (&#8220;BodyArmor&#8221;), which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. During 2021, in conjunction with acquiring the remaining ownership interest, we recognized a noncash gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the $5.6 billion purchase price to the BodyArmor trademark. During the three months ended March 29, 2024, the operating results related to the trademark were lower than expected. Therefore, the Company revised its projections of the future operating results related to the trademark, which triggered the need to update its impairment analysis. As a result, the Company concluded that the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $760 million. The decrease in fair value was primarily driven by the revised projections of future operating results as well as higher discount rates resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions since the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our revised financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change, causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods. \n\nPension Plan Valuations \n\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States. \n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. \n\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans&#8217; projected cash flows. \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk. \n\nIn 2024, the Company&#8217;s total net periodic pension cost was $45 million. In 2025, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $81 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to a lower expected return on assets resulting from a transfer of $523 million of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company in 2024. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64% and 58% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $7 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an $18 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost. \n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers&#8217; locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less. \n\nIn most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers&#8217; always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our best estimate of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; to be sustained; (2) the tax position is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading &#8220;Operations Review &#8212; Income Taxes&#8221; below and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nA number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. The number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nTax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes \n\nfuture tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. \n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. \n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company&#8217;s local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOPERATIONS REVIEW \n\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands \n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company&#8217;s operating performance, from time to time we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company&#8217;s performance. \n\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company&#8217;s performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company&#8217;s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading &#8220;Beverage Volume&#8221; below. \n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading &#8220;Beverage Volume&#8221; below. \n\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading &#8220;Net Operating Revenues&#8221; below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. \n\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as &#8220;structural changes,&#8221; which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company&#8217;s unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company&#8217;s acquisitions and divestitures. \n\n&#8220;Acquired brands&#8221; refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change. \n\n&#8220;Licensed brands&#8221; refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change. \n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment. \n\nBeverage Volume \n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, &#8220;unit case&#8221; means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and &#8220;unit case volume&#8221; means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers&#8217; inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. \n\nInformation about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Percent Change 2024 versus 2023 Unit Cases \n\n1,2 \n\nConcentrate Sales Worldwide 1 % \n\n1 % \n\nEurope, Middle East &#38; Africa &#8212; (1) Latin America 3 3 North America &#8212; 1 Asia Pacific 1 3 \n\nGlobal Ventures 2 \n\n4 Bottling Investments (23) \n\nN/A ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. \n\n2 Geographic and Global Ventures operating segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. Global Ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume growth for Costa retail stores. \n\n3 After considering the impact of structural changes, unit case volume for Bottling Investments grew 5%. \n\n4 After considering the impact of structural changes, worldwide concentrate sales volume grew 2%. \n\n5 After considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume for Asia Pacific grew 2%. \n\nUnit Case Volume \n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 33.7 billion and 33.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nUnit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa was even, which included 4% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, offset by a 1% decline in Trademark Coca-Cola and a 5% decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. Unit case volume in sparkling flavors was even. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 2% in the Africa operating unit, offset by a decline of 2% in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit. Unit case volume performance in the Europe operating unit was even. \n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 3%, which included 5% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 2% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, partially offset by a 1% decline in sparkling flavors. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even. The operating segment&#8217;s volume performance included 8% growth in Brazil and 2% growth in Mexico, partially offset by a decline of 12% in Argentina. \n\nUnit case volume in North America was even, which included 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1% growth in both Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors, offset by a 4% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. \n\nIn Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 1%, which included 4% growth in sparkling flavors and 3% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, partially offset by a 4% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 7% in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit and 4% in both the ASEAN and South Pacific and the Japan and South Korea operating units, partially offset by a decline of 5% in the Greater China and Mongolia operating unit. \n\nUnit case volume for Global Ventures increased 2%, driven by growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 6% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even. \n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 23%, which primarily reflects the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India. \n\nConcentrate Sales Volume \n\nIn 2024, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 1% compared to 2023. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals. \n\nNet Operating Revenues \n\nNet operating revenues were $47,061 million in 2024, compared to $45,754 million in 2023, an increase of $1,307 million, or 3%. \n\nThe following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments: \n\n##TABLE_START Percent Change 2024 versus 2023 Volume 1 \n\nPrice, Product &#38; Geographic Mix Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Acquisitions &#38; Divestitures 2 \n\nTotal Consolidated 2 % 11 % (5) % (4) % 3 &#160; % Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa (1) 17 (16) &#8212; 1 &#160; Latin America 3 21 (14) &#8212; 11 &#160; North America 1 10 &#8212; &#8212; 11 &#160; Asia Pacific 2 2 (3) &#8212; 2 &#160; Global Ventures 4 (3) 2 &#8212; 2 &#160; Bottling Investments 5 5 (2) (28) (21) ##TABLE_END\n\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. \n\n1 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading &#8220;Beverage Volume&#8221; above. \n\n2 Includes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading &#8220;Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands&#8221; above. \n\nRefer to the heading &#8220;Beverage Volume&#8221; above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes. \n\n&#8220;Price, product and geographic mix&#8221; refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as pricing actions taken by the Company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; the mix of categories, products and packages sold; and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. Management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that these items had on the Company&#8217;s net operating revenues. The impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating revenues. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company&#8217;s performance. \n\nPrice, product and geographic mix had an 11% favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; Europe, Middle East and Africa &#8212; favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in T&#252;rkiye and Zimbabwe, and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by increased funding for promotional and marketing support; \n\n&#8226; Latin America &#8212; favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, partially offset by increased funding for promotional and marketing support; \n\n&#8226; North America &#8212; favorable pricing initiatives and package and category mix, partially offset by unfavorable channel mix and increased funding for promotional and marketing support; \n\n&#8226; Asia Pacific &#8212; favorable pricing initiatives and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by unfavorable channel, category and package mix and increased funding for promotional and marketing support; \n\n&#8226; Global Ventures &#8212; unfavorable product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives; and \n\n&#8226; Bottling Investments &#8212; favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. \n\nThe favorable pricing initiatives for the year ended December 31, 2024 in all operating segments included both new and carryover pricing increases from the prior year. \n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 5%. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Nigerian naira, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the British pound and euro, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Global Ventures operating segments. Refer to the heading &#8220;Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange&#8221; below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n&#8220;Acquisitions and divestitures&#8221; generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company&#8217;s net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company&#8217;s net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company&#8217;s performance. Refer to the heading &#8220;Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands&#8221; above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2025 net operating revenues. \n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa 15.8 &#160; % 16.2 % Latin America 13.7 &#160; 12.7 North America 39.6 &#160; 36.6 Asia Pacific 10.8 &#160; 10.3 Global Ventures 6.7 &#160; 6.7 Bottling Investments 13.2 &#160; 17.2 Corporate 0.2 &#160; 0.3 Total 100.0 &#160; % 100.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. For additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading &#8220;Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange&#8221; below. \n\nGross Profit Margin \n\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company&#8217;s performance. \n\nOur gross profit margin increased to 61.1% in 2024 from 59.5% in 2023. This increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and the refranchising of our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Selling and distribution expenses $ 2,525 &#160; $ 2,599 Advertising expenses 5,146 &#160; 5,010 Stock-based compensation expense 286 &#160; 254 Other operating expenses 6,625 &#160; 6,109 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 14,582 &#160; $ 13,972 ##TABLE_END\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $610 million, or 4%, in 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher advertising expenses, stock-based compensation expense and other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in selling and distribution expenses. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased charitable donations, higher employee costs, higher other marketing expenses and an asset impairment charge related to certain prototypes. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses was primarily due to the refranchising of our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India, partially offset by increases in Costa expenses. In 2024, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 4%. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charge. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $234 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nOther Operating Charges \n\nOther operating charges incurred by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; Latin America 126 &#160; &#8212; North America 760 &#160; 26 Asia Pacific &#8212; &#160; 35 Global Ventures &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Bottling Investments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Corporate 3,277 &#160; 1,890 Total $ 4,163 &#160; $ 1,951 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2024, the Company recorded other operating charges of $4,163 million. These charges consisted of $3,109 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife in 2020, $760 million related to the impairment of our BodyArmor trademark, $133 million related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program and $126 million related to the impairment of a trademark in Latin America. In addition, other operating charges included $15 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the BodyArmor acquisition in 2021, $13 million related to an indemnification agreement entered into as a part of the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations, $7 million of transaction costs related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in certain territories in India and $2 million of transaction costs related to the sale of a portion of our interest in Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (&#8220;Coke Consolidated&#8221;), an equity method investee. These charges were partially offset by a net benefit of $2 million related to a revision of management&#8217;s estimates for tax litigation expense. \n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,951 million. These charges consisted of $1,702 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $164 million related to the Company&#8217;s productivity and reinvestment program and $35 million related to the discontinuation of certain manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific. In addition, other operating charges included $27 million related to the restructuring of our North America operating unit, $15 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the BodyArmor acquisition and $8 million related to tax litigation expense. \n\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the refranchising of our bottling operations and the sale of a portion of our interest in Coke Consolidated. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial \n\nStatements for additional information related to the tax litigation.

Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these charges had on our operating segments and Corporate. \n\nOperating Income and Operating Margin \n\nInformation about our operating income contribution by operating segment and Corporate on a percentage basis is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa 41.3 &#160; % 37.2 % Latin America 37.8 &#160; 30.3 North America 43.4 &#160; 39.2 Asia Pacific 21.5 &#160; 18.0 Global Ventures 3.6 &#160; 2.9 Bottling Investments 5.0 &#160; 5.1 Corporate (52.6) (32.7) Total 100.0 &#160; % 100.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating margin is a ratio calculated by dividing operating income by net operating revenues. Management believes operating margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business after considering selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company&#8217;s performance. \n\nInformation about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment and Corporate is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Consolidated 21.2 &#160; % 24.7 % Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa 55.4 &#160; 56.8 Latin America 58.5 &#160; 58.9 North America 23.3 &#160; 26.4 Asia Pacific 42.3 &#160; 43.2 Global Ventures 11.5 &#160; 10.7 Bottling Investments 8.0 &#160; 7.4 Corporate * * ##TABLE_END\n\n* Calculation is not meaningful. \n\nOperating income was $9,992 million in 2024, compared to $11,311 million in 2023, a decrease of $1,319 million, or 12%. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by higher commodity costs; higher selling, general and administrative expenses; higher other operating charges; the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India; and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 11%. These items were partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 2% and favorable pricing initiatives. \n\nThe decrease in our operating margin on a consolidated basis was primarily due to higher commodity costs; higher selling, general and administrative expenses; higher other operating charges; and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives and the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India. \n\nIn 2024, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 11% due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira, Nigerian naira and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Global Ventures operating segments. Refer to the heading &#8220;Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position &#8212; Foreign Exchange&#8221; below. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment reported operating income of $4,125 million and $4,202 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a decline in concentrate sales volume of 1%, higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 15%, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives. \n\nLatin America reported operating income of $3,780 million and $3,432 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 3% and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, higher other operating charges and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 17%. \n\nOperating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $4,336 million and $4,435 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and higher other operating charges, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 1% and favorable pricing initiatives. \n\nAsia Pacific&#8217;s operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2,148 million and $2,040 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 2%, favorable pricing initiatives, lower other operating charges and the impact of acquired brands and structural changes, partially offset by higher commodity costs and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2%. \n\nGlobal Ventures&#8217; operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $359 million and $329 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 4%, lower commodity costs and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1%, partially offset by increased marketing spending and higher operating expenses. \n\nBottling Investments&#8217; operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $496 million and $578 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India, higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1%, partially offset by unit case volume growth of 5% and favorable pricing initiatives. \n\nCorporate&#8217;s operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $5,252 million and $3,705 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2024 increased primarily as a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition and higher operating expenses, partially offset by decreased marketing spending. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fairlife contingent consideration. \n\nInterest Income \n\nInterest income was $988 million in 2024, compared to $907 million in 2023, an increase of $81 million, or 9%. This increase was primarily driven by higher average investment balances on our Corporate and certain international investments. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense was $1,656 million in 2024, compared to $1,527 million in 2023, an increase of $129 million, or 8%. This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average long-term debt balances compared to the prior year. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nEquity Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nEquity income (loss) &#8212; net represents our Company&#8217;s proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2024, equity income was $1,770 million, compared to equity income of $1,691 million in 2023, an increase of $79 million, or 5%. The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by certain of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the sale of our ownership interests in certain of our equity method investees and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $92 million and $159 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represent the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. \n\nOther Income (Loss) &#8212; Net \n\nIn 2024, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $1,992 million. The Company recorded a net gain of $595 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in the Philippines, including the impact of post-closing adjustments, and recognized a net gain of $506 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee in Thailand, including the impact of post-closing adjustments. The Company also recognized a net gain of $338 million related to the sale of a portion of our interest in Coke Consolidated, a net gain of $303 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in certain territories in India, including the impact of post-closing adjustments, and a net gain of $290 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Additionally, the Company recognized dividend income of $205 million and net income of $76 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, of which $21 million was due to pension and other postretirement benefit plan settlement gains. Other income (loss) &#8212; net also included net foreign currency exchange losses of $180 million, $114 million of costs related to our trade accounts receivable factoring program and an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $34 million related to an equity method investee in Latin America. \n\nIn 2023, other income (loss) &#8212; net was income of $570 million. The Company recorded a net gain of $439 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam, a net gain of $289 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and dividend income of $208 million. Other income (loss) &#8212; net also included a net gain of $94 million related to the sale of our ownership interests in our equity method investees in Pakistan and Indonesia and a net loss of $17 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, of which $67 million was due to pension and other postretirement benefit plan settlement losses. The Company also recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $312 million and $83 million of costs related to our trade accounts receivable factoring program. Additionally, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $39 million related to an equity method investee in Latin America and charges of $32 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States. \n\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our divestitures. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on equity and debt securities. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefit plan activity. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States and the impairment charges. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. The decision of whether we decide to pursue the renewal of these grants and the impact of the grants going forward is dependent on various factors. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $346 million and $332 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method. \n\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 % State and local income taxes &#8212; net of federal benefit 1.1 &#160; 1.1 Earnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate 1.0 &#160; (0.3) Equity income or loss (2.6) (2.1) Excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (0.5) (0.3) Other &#8212; net (1.4) (2.0) Effective tax rate 18.6 &#160; % 17.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company&#8217;s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which it predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the Company&#8217;s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. &#38; Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its positions. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $880 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $607 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $273 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. \n\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 929 &#160; $ 926 Increase related to prior period tax positions 33 &#160; 2 Decrease related to prior period tax positions (52) (25) Increase related to current period tax positions 30 &#160; 32 Decrease related to settlements with taxing authorities (57) &#8212; Decrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations &#8212; &#160; (2) Effect of foreign currency translation (3) (4) Balance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 880 &#160; $ 929 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had $631 million and $544 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of these amounts, expense of $87 million and $48 million was recognized in 2024 and 2023, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. \n\nBased on current tax laws, including the impact of several countries enacting global minimum tax regulations, the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate in 2025 is expected to be approximately 20.8% before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. This rate does not include the impact of the ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the Company were not to prevail. \n\nMany jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the OECD&#8217;s Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a two-pillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding &#8364;20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable market jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the international implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain. \n\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires, with certain limited exceptions, the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. Numerous countries have enacted legislation that implemented certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024, while many others have indicated their intent to adopt, or have adopted, legislation effective in 2025. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. The Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. \n\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION \n\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading &#8220;Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners&#8217; equity. Refer to the heading &#8220;Cash Flows from Financing Activities&#8221; below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $14.6 billion as of December 31, 2024. In addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2024. These backup lines of credit expire at various times through 2029. \n\nOur current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Certain financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $21,873 million and $17,704 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $114 million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion. During 2025, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans. \n\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that certain U.S. tax regulations (known as the blocked-income regulations) that address the effect of certain Brazilian legal restrictions on royalty payments by the Company&#8217;s licensee in Brazil apply to the Company&#8217;s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. &#38; Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. On August 2, 2024, the Tax Court entered a decision reflecting additional federal income tax of $2.7 billion for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. With applicable interest, the total liability for the 2007 through 2009 tax years resulting from the Tax Court&#8217;s decision is $6.0 billion, for which the IRS issued the Company invoices on September 3, 2024. The Company paid the IRS Tax Litigation Deposit on September 10, 2024, which stopped interest from accruing on the additional tax due for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. That amount, plus interest earned, would be refunded in full or in part if the Company&#8217;s tax positions are ultimately sustained on appeal. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded net interest income of $77 million related to this tax payment in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income, in accordance with our accounting policy. The payment of the IRS invoices and the related accrued interest were recorded in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Company appealed the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS&#8217; positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would not receive a refund of the applicable portion or all of the $6.0 billion it paid in response to the IRS invoices issued in September 2024 and the related accrued interest receivable of $103 million as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company estimates that the potential aggregate remaining incremental tax and interest liability for the tax years 2010 through 2024 could be approximately $12 billion as of December 31, 2024. Additional income tax and interest on any unpaid potential liabilities for the 2010 through 2024 tax years would continue to \n\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation. \n\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter. \n\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future. \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $6,805 million and $11,599 million, respectively, a decrease of $4,794 million, or 41%. This decrease was primarily driven by the $6.0 billion IRS Tax Litigation Deposit, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher other tax payments, increased charitable donations, and the reduced operating cash flows resulting from the refranchising of our bottling operations. The decrease was also impacted by additional annual incentive payments in the current year due to improved business performance in the prior year. These items were partially offset by strong cash operating results, the transfer of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company, payments in the prior year resulting from the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, increased dividend payments from our equity method investees, and $167 million of the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife in the prior year. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the refranchising of our bottling operations. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the pension transfer. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone payment for fairlife. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2,524 million in 2024 and net cash used in investing activities was $3,349 million in 2023. \n\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments \n\nIn 2024, purchases of investments were $5,640 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $6,589 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $949 million. In 2023, purchases of investments were $6,698 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,354 million, resulting in a net cash outflow of $2,344 million. This activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the Company&#8217;s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies. \n\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities \n\nIn 2024 and 2023, the Company&#8217;s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $315 million and $62 million, respectively. \n\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities \n\nIn 2024 and 2023, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $3,485 million and $430 million, respectively. The activity during 2024 primarily related to the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations and sales of our ownership interests in certain equity method investees. The activity during 2023 primarily related to sales of our ownership interests in certain equity method investees. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $2,064 million and $1,852 million, respectively. \n\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Capital expenditures $ 2,064 &#160; $ 1,852 Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa 0.8 &#160; % 2.3 % Latin America &#8212; &#160; &#8212; North America 29.2 &#160; 22.3 Asia Pacific 0.9 &#160; 1.2 Global Ventures 9.9 &#160; 10.4 Bottling Investments 35.6 &#160; 45.5 Corporate 23.6 &#160; 18.3 ##TABLE_END\n\nCollateral (Paid) Received Associated with Hedging Activities &#8212; Net \n\nCollateral received associated with our hedging activities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $235 million and $366 million, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities. \n\nOther Investing Activities \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $194 million and $39 million, respectively. The activity during 2024 included the receipt of a $100 million installment payment on the note receivable related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee in Pakistan in 2023 and the collection of $69 million of deferred proceeds related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6,910 million and $8,310 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nLoans, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt \n\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners&#8217; equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our long-term debt was rated &#8220;A+&#8221; by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and &#8220;A1&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s. Our commercial paper program was rated &#8220;A-1&#8221; by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and &#8220;P-1&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coke Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company&#8217;s business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers&#8217; financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies&#8217; methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers&#8217; credit ratings were to decline, the Company&#8217;s equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers. \n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. \n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. \n\nDuring 2024, the Company had issuances of debt of $12,061 million, which included $3,309 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $8,752 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. \n\nDuring 2024, the Company made payments of debt of $9,533 million, which consisted of $1,269 million of net payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $5,276 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, and payments of long-term debt of $2,988 million. During 2024, the Company extinguished $485 million of long-term debt prior to maturity. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nDuring 2023, the Company had issuances of debt of $6,891 million, which included $6,436 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $233 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. \n\nDuring 2023, the Company made payments of debt of $5,034 million, which consisted of $4,591 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $443 million. \n\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, continued to be published through June 2023. As a result of the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities. \n\nIssuances of Stock \n\nThe issuances of stock in 2024 and 2023 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees. \n\nPurchases of Stock for Treasury \n\nIn 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 150 million shares (&#8220;2019 Plan&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock. \n\nDuring 2024, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,795 million. The Company repurchased 26.5 million shares of common stock under the 2019 Plan. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $63.91, for a total cost of $1,694 million. The net impact of the Company&#8217;s issuances of stock and treasury stock purchases during 2024 resulted in a net cash outflow of $1,048 million. \n\nDuring 2023, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $2,289 million. The Company repurchased 36.9 million shares of common stock under the 2019 Plan. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $59.08, for a total cost of $2,177 million. The net impact of the Company&#8217;s issuances of stock and treasury stock purchases during 2023 resulted in a net cash outflow of $1,750 million. \n\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.6 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $18.30. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company&#8217;s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. \n\nDividends \n\nThe Company paid dividends of $8,359 million and $7,952 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nAt its February 2025 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.51 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $2.04 per share in 2025. This is our 63 rd consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.94 per share and $1.84 per share in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nOther Financing Activities \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $31 million and $465 million, respectively. The activities during 2023 included $108 million of the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife and payments totaling $311 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone payment for fairlife. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period Total 2025 2026-2027 2028-2029 2030 and Thereafter \n\nLoans and notes payable: 1 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Commercial paper borrowings $ 1,139 $ 1,139 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings 360 360 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; \n\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt 2 \n\n648 648 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; \n\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities 2 \n\n46,176 &#8212; 6,925 5,693 33,558 \n\nEstimated interest payments 3 \n\n18,643 1,115 1,835 1,581 14,112 \n\nAccrued income taxes 4 \n\n1,414 1,387 27 &#8212; &#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations 5 \n\n25,745 15,287 6,383 2,593 1,482 \n\nMarketing obligations 6 \n\n3,401 2,237 706 298 160 Lease obligations 2,198 424 655 428 691 \n\nAcquisition obligations 7 \n\n6,172 6,172 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; \n\nHeld-for-sale and related obligations 8 \n\n10 10 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total contractual obligations $ 105,906 $ 28,779 $ 16,531 $ 10,593 $ 50,003 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. \n\n2 Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the Company and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums. \n\n3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2024 rate for all periods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. \n\n4 Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes include $1,185 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,515 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. \n\n5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \n\n7 Primarily represents our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of fairlife. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n8 Represents liabilities and contractual obligations that were classified as held for sale related to certain bottling operations in India. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2024 was $945 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table above. \n\nWe expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately $30 million in 2025 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plan was $3,869 million, and the fair value of the plan assets was $3,761 million. The projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified \n\npension plan was $2,176 million, and the fair value of the plans&#8217; assets was $2,674 million. The Company sponsors various unfunded pension plans outside the United States as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S. employees. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will be approximately $65 million for 2025. Thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually decline. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company&#8217;s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company&#8217;s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. As of December 31, 2024, our self-insurance reserves totaled $168 million. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above. \n\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2024 were $2,469 million. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $766 million, of which $82 million was related to VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is remote. As of December 31, 2024, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity. \n\nForeign Exchange \n\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. \n\nIn 2024 and 2023, our operating income was impacted by the weighted-average fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies) and for certain individual currencies. These currencies strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 All operating currencies (5) % (2) % Australian dollar (1) (5) Brazilian real (7) 3 British pound 3 &#160; 2 Chinese yuan (2) (7) Euro &#8212; &#160; 3 Indian rupee (1) (6) Japanese yen (7) (7) Mexican peso (3) 14 Philippine peso (3) (3) South African rand 1 &#160; (11) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our hedging activities are designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income. \n\nThe total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 5% and 4% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 11% and 8% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) &#8212; net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading &#8220;Operations Review &#8212; Other Income (Loss) &#8212; Net&#8221; above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $180 million and $312 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices \n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. \n\n"}
