The decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales was driven by share loss primarily due to European biosimilar entrants. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) was due to continued biosimilar competition. The growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains. \n\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company&#8217;s sales of STELARA. \n\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE. \n\nInfectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2024, a decline of 23.1% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. \n\nNeuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 0.4% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decline in Other Neuroscience. The decline was partially offset by the growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand. \n\nOncology products achieved sales of $20.8 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 17.7% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was primarily due to continued share gains and market growth. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures. \n\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 12.3% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of both OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth and share gains. Growth in Other Pulmonary Hypertension was driven by OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil). \n\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.6 billion, a decline of 3.0% as compared to the prior year driven by declines in Other. \n\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company&#8217;s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDuring 2024, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing BALVERSA (erdafitinib) Treatment of Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma and Selected Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Gene Alterations (THOR) &#8226; &#8226; CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) Treatment for Relapsed and Refactor multiple myeloma with 1-3 PL (CARTITUDE-4) &#8226; &#8226; DARZALEX (daratumumab) Treatment for frontline multiple myeloma transplant eligible (PERSEUS) &#8226; &#8226; DARZALEX (daratumumab) Treatment for frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible (CEPHEUS) &#8226; &#8226; DARZALEX (daratumumab) Treatment as subcutaneous monotherapy for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (AQUILA) &#8226; &#8226; EDURANT (rilpivirine) Treatment for pediatric patients (2-12 years old) with HIV &#8226; &#8226; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) Treatment for frontline MCL (Triangle) &#8226; nipocalimab Treatment for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis &#8226; &#8226; OPSUMIT (macitentan) Treatment for pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (TOMORROW) &#8226; &#8226; OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil STCT) Treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension &#8226; &#8226; REKAMBYS Treatment for Adolescents HIV &#8226; RYBREVANT (amivantamab) In Combination with Chemotherapy for the First-Line Treatment of Adult Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Activating EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations (PAPILLON) &#8226; &#8226; RYBREVANT (amivantamab) Treatment for subcutaneous (PALOMA-3) &#8226; &#8226; RYBREVANT / LAZCLUZE Treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MARIPOSA) &#8226; &#8226; RYBREVANT Treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2L (MARIPOSA-2) &#8226; &#8226; SIMPONI (golimumab) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis &#8226; &#8226; SPRAVATO (esketamine) monotherapy Treatment of Patients with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD4005) &#8226; STELARA (ustekinumab) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Crohn's Disease &#8226; TREMFYA (guselkumab) Treatment of Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (QUASAR) &#8226; &#8226; TREMFYA (guselkumab) Subcutaneous Induction for treatment of patients with Ulcerative Colitis (ASTRO) &#8226; TREMFYA (guselkumab) Subcutaneous Induction for treatment of patients with Crohn's Disease (GRAVITI) &#8226; &#8226; TREMFYA (guselkumab) Treatment of Patients with Crohn's Disease (GALAXI) &#8226; &#8226; TREMFYA (guselkumab) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Psoriasis &#8226; UPTRAVI (selexipag) Treatment of Patients with Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (SALTO) &#8226; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 2024 Annual Report \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMedTech segment \n\nThe MedTech segment sales in 2024 were $31.9 billion, an increase of 4.8% from 2023, which included operational growth of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.4%.

The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily due to China volume-based procurement across all platforms and competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters. This was partially offset by the strength of the portfolio and commercial execution in Biosurgery as well as the strength of new products in Endocutters. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by technology penetration and benefits from the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio as well as increased procedure volume. This growth was offset by the negative impact of currency and the Acclarent divestiture. \n\nThe Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 2.4% from 2023. The fiscal 2024 includes a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all Orthopaedic platforms in the U.S. which positively impacted the worldwide Orthopaedics franchise growth as well as the negative impact from the near-term revenue disruption related to the previously announced Orthopaedics restructuring. The growth in Hips reflects continued strength of the portfolio primarily in the Anterior approach, and global procedure growth. The growth in Knees was primarily driven by the ATTUNE portfolio, pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution and global procedure growth. Growth in Trauma was driven by the adoption of recently launched products.

Electrophysiology growth was driven by global procedure growth, new product performance and commercial execution. This was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and competitive pressures in Pulsed Field Ablation catheters in the U.S. Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all major commercialized regions driven by the continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP. \n\nThe Vision franchise achieved sales of $5.1 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 1.5% from 2023. Contact Lenses/Other growth was primarily driven by price actions, continued strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products (including recent launches), impacts from a one-time change in contract shipping terms in the U.S. and lapping of prior year impacts of Russian sanctions partially offset by U.S. distributor stocking dynamics.

Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $1.5 billion and the approximately $11.6 billion ($13.5 billion nominal) reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. \n\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of $22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the Johnson &#38; Johnson \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\ndivested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson &#38; Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet. \n\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson &#38; Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common Stock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson &#38; Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson &#38; Johnson common stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within continuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. \n\nJohnson &#38; Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the date of the exchange offer, Johnson &#38; Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson &#38; Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $3.6 billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial Paper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $0.4 billion recorded in Other (income) expense. \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 29, 2024: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations. \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Total 2025 $2,536 1,749 1,075 5,360 2026 &#8212; 1,999 1,030 3,029 2027 &#8212; 2,385 1,021 3,406 2028 &#8212; 2,275 977 3,252 2029 &#8212; 1,444 922 2,366 After 2029 &#8212; 22,548 8,921 31,469 Total $2,536 32,400 13,946 48,882 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the proposed talc settlement payments, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_START 2024 Annual Report \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinancing and market risk \n\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company&#8217;s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company&#8217;s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. \n\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company&#8217;s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company&#8217;s swap contracts by approximately $1.5 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. \n\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. \n\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company&#8217;s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $8.0 million. \n\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In June 2024, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on June 25, 2025. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. \n\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $36.6 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The increase in the borrowings was due to the issuance of new debt in 2024. In 2024, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $12.1 billion compared to net debt of $6.4 billion in 2023. Total debt represented 34.0% of total capital (shareholders&#8217; equity and total debt) in 2024 and 30.0% of total capital in 2023. Shareholders&#8217; equity per share at the end of 2024 was $29.70 compared to $28.57 at year-end 2023. \n\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nDividends \n\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2024 for the 62 nd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.91 per share in 2024 and $4.70 per share in 2023. \n\nOn January 2, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on March 4, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2025. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOther information \n\nCritical accounting policies and estimates \n\nManagement&#8217;s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company&#8217;s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. \n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. \n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. \n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost patent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. \n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company&#8217;s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022. \n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers. \n\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. \n\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. \n\n##TABLE_START 2024 Annual Report \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nInnovative Medicine segment \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Balance at \n\nBeginning \n\nof Period \n\nAccruals Payments/ \n\nCredits (2) \n\nBalance at \n\nEnd of \n\nPeriod \n\n2024 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nAccrued rebates (1) \n\n$14,661 52,786 (51,667) 15,780 Accrued returns 634 845 (355) 1,124 Accrued promotions 6 3 (6) 3 Subtotal $15,301 53,634 (52,028) 16,907 Reserve for doubtful accounts 33 14 (6) 41 Reserve for cash discounts 111 1,493 (1,495) 109 Total $15,445 55,141 (53,529) 17,057 2023 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nAccrued rebates (1) \n\n$12,289 47,523 (45,151) 14,661 Accrued returns 649 332 (347) 634 Accrued promotions 1 12 (7) 6 Subtotal $12,939 47,867 (45,505) 15,301 Reserve for doubtful accounts 44 0 (11) 33 Reserve for cash discounts 110 1,386 (1,385) 111 Total $13,093 49,253 (46,901) 15,445 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $187 million at December 29, 2024 and $165 million at December 31, 2023, recorded as a contra asset. \n\n(2) Includes prior period adjustments \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMedTech segment \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals Payments/ Credits Balance at End of Period 2024 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nAccrued rebates (1) \n\n$1,455 5,955 (5,986) 1,424 Accrued returns 125 543 (550) 118 Accrued promotions 25 62 (65) 22 Subtotal $1,605 6,560 (6,601) 1,564 Reserve for doubtful accounts 133 31 (38) 126 Reserve for cash discounts 5 92 (91) 6 Total $1,743 6,683 (6,730) 1,696 2023 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nAccrued rebates (1) \n\n$1,470 6,241 (6,256) 1,455 Accrued returns 134 555 (564) 125 Accrued promotions 43 74 (92) 25 Subtotal $1,647 6,870 (6,912) 1,605 Reserve for doubtful accounts 125 33 (25) 133 Reserve for cash discounts 9 96 (100) 5 Total $1,781 6,999 (7,037) 1,743 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $704 million at December 29, 2024 and $740 million at December 31, 2023, recorded as a contra asset. \n\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. \n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. \n\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. \n\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management&#8217;s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. \n\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. \n\n##TABLE_START 2024 Annual Report \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. \n\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company&#8217;s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. \n\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates. \n\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nNew accounting pronouncements \n\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 29, 2024. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEconomic and market factors \n\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2014 - 2024, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company&#8217;s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). \n\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. \n\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen&#8217;s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA&#8217;s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court&#8217;s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit. \n\nRussia-Ukraine War \n\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business of the Company&#8217;s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation. \n\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare purposes. \n\nConflict in the Middle East \n\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business of the Company&#8217;s Israel subsidiaries represented 1% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues. \n\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2024 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.1 billion. \n\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. \n\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and reimbursement of healthcare products. \n\n##TABLE_START 2024 Annual Report \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company&#8217;s businesses. \n\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company&#8217;s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. \n\nLegal proceedings \n\nJohnson &#38; Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. \n\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2024, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. \n\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. \n\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings. \n\nCommon stock \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 6, 2025, there were 114,147 record holders of Common Stock of the Company. \n\n"}
