Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $40.54 for 2024, compared with $22.87 for 2023. ROE was 12.7% for 2024, compared with 7.5% for 2023. Book value per common share was $336.77 as of December 2024, 7.4% higher compared with December 2023. \n\nNet revenues were $53.51 billion for 2024, 16% higher than 2023, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in Global Banking &#38; Markets and Asset &#38; Wealth Management. The increase in net revenues in Global Banking &#38; Markets primarily reflected higher net revenues in Equities, significantly higher Investment banking fees and higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC). The increase in net revenues in Asset &#38; Wealth Management primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and higher Management and other fees. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were slightly higher. \n\nProvision for credit losses was $1.35 billion for 2024, compared with $1.03 billion for 2023. Provisions for 2024 reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs). Provisions for 2023 reflected net provisions related to both the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale loans (primarily driven by impairments), partially offset by reserve reductions related to the transfer of the GreenSky loan portfolio to held for sale and the sale of substantially all of the Marcus by Goldman Sachs (Marcus) loan portfolio. \n\nOperating expenses were $33.77 billion for 2024, 2% lower than 2023, reflecting decreases driven by significantly lower expenses, including impairments, related to commercial real estate in consolidated investment entities (CIEs) and other significant expenses recognized in the prior year, including the write-down of identifiable intangible assets related to GreenSky Holdings, LLC (GreenSky), an impairment of goodwill related to Consumer platforms and the FDIC special assessment fee. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance) and higher transaction based expenses. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 63.1% for 2024, compared with 74.6% for 2023. \n\nDuring 2024, we returned a total of $11.80 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $8.00 billion of common share repurchases and $3.80 billion of common stock dividends. As of December 2024, our CET1 capital ratio was 15.0% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 15.3% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios. \n\n##TABLE_START Goldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n"}
