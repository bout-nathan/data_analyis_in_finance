\n\nThis Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company&#8217;s business under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2017 Form 10-K. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nOur sales and revenues for 2017 were $45.462 billion, an 18 percent increase from 2016 sales and revenues of $38.537 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume , mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Favorable price realization , mostly in &#32;Construction Industries , also contributed to the sales improvement. Profit per share for 2017 was $1.26, compared to a loss per share of $0.11 in 2016. Profit was $754 million in 2017, compared to a loss of $67 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved price realization, a decrease in mark-to-market losses &#32;related to pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEB) &#32;plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in &#32;Resource Industries &#32;in 2016 offset by higher taxes primarily due to enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. An increase in period costs &#32;and restructuring costs &#32;was partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs . \n\nFourth-quarter 2017 sales and revenues were $12.896 billion, up $3.322 billion, or 35 percent, from $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 loss was $2.18 per share, compared with a loss of $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 loss was $1.299 billion, compared with a loss of $1.171 billion in 2016. \n\nHighlights for 2017 include: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales and revenues in 2017 were $45.462 billion, up 18 percent from 2016. Sales improved in all regions and most end markets. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nProfit was $1.26 per share for 2017, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share &#32;was $6.88. For 2016, loss per share was $0.11, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $3.42. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items: \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInventory decreased about $200 million in the fourth-quarter 2017. For the full year, inventory increased about $1.4 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nMachinery, Energy &#38; Transportation (ME&#38;T) &#32;operating cash flow for 2017 was about $5.5 billion, more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividends. \n\n##TABLE_END Restructuring Costs \n\nIn recent years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. During 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. During 2016, we incurred $1.019 billion of restructuring costs, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy &#38; Transportation . In 2018, we expect restructuring actions to continue and anticipate costs of about $400 million. \n\nNotes: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGlossary of terms included on pages 49-52; first occurrence of terms shown in bold italics. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInformation on non-GAAP financial measures is included on pages 65-66. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n2017 &#32;COMPARED WITH 2016 &#32; \n\nCONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2016 &#32;(at left) and 2017 &#32;(at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. \n\nTotal sales and revenues were $45.462 billion in 2017, an increase of $6.925 billion, or 18 percent, compared with $38.537 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand, which we expect to continue in 2018. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $100 million in 2017, compared to a decrease of about $1.6 billion during 2016. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers&#8217; demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. \n\nBy segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. Resource Industries sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and a favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s sales volume was higher mostly due to increased demand for equipment and aftermarket parts for oil and gas and industrial applications. Favorable price realization, mostly in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products&#8217; revenues were about flat. \n\nSales increased in all regions. In North America, sales increased 19 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand mostly for on-shore oil and gas applications and construction equipment, the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries. Asia/Pacific sales increased 23 percent primarily due to an increase in construction equipment sales, mostly in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. EAME &#32;sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in Resource Industries and favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealers decreased inventories in 2016 and inventories were about flat in 2017. In addition, price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries. Sales increased 25 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. \n\nThe increase in demand in 2017 led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. Despite improvements in material flows in the second half of 2017, parts and components constraints remain across some products, which could impact the company&#8217;s growth potential in 2018 as our global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2016 &#32;(at left) and 2017 &#32;(at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit &#32; appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments &#32;and Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation other operating (income) expenses . \n\nOperating profit for 2017 was $4.406 billion, compared with $498 million in 2016. The increase of $3.908 billion was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved price realization, a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. An increase in period costs and restructuring costs was partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs. \n\nPeriod costs increased primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year. These actions primarily impacted depreciation expense and research and development (R&#38;D) expenses. \n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $1.4 billion in 2017, significantly above targeted levels, compared to about $250 million in 2016. For 2018, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be significantly lower than 2017. \n\nIn 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. In 2016, restructuring costs were $1.019 billion, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy &#38; Transportation. \n\nVariable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, and decreased in 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable in 2017, as higher steel costs were partially offset by cost reduction actions. We expect material costs to be higher in 2018, primarily due to anticipated increases in commodity prices. \n\nOther Profit/Loss Items \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther income/expense in 2017 was income of $207 million, compared with income of $146 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to a pretax gain on the sale of Caterpillar's equity investment in IronPlanet, gains on sale of securities and an increase in interest income. The favorable change was partially offset by an unfavorable net impact from currency &#32;translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2017 were significantly higher than the net losses in 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe provision for income taxes &#32;for 2017 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 27.7 percent, compared to 36.4 percent for the full-year 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2017 full-year \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nadjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared to 26 percent in 2016. \n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2017 also includes a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We believe this charge is a reasonable estimate, as of January 18, 2018, that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. The 2017 provision for income taxes also includes the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA tax benefit of $64 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA charge of $15 million for an increase in prior year taxes related to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility, restructuring costs. \n\n##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a non-cash charge of $141 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, for increases in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets. \n\nWe expect the annual effective tax rate will be lower in 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform. \n\nSegment Information \n\n&#160;

The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales volume increased due to higher end-user demand, primarily for equipment in Asia/Pacific and North America. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAlthough market conditions remain competitive, price realization was favorable due to a particularly weak pricing environment in 2016, and previously implemented price increases impacting 2017. \n\n##TABLE_END Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in Asia/Pacific and North America. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. We expect 2018 sales in China to be higher due to continued building construction and infrastructure investment with a strong first half and some tempering in the latter part of the year, largely due to anticipated seasonality. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to improved oil and gas, residential and nonresidential construction activities. Also contributing to higher sales was the impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased more in 2016 than in 2017, and favorable price realization. We expect improvement in residential, nonresidential and infrastructure construction activities in North America to result in higher end-used demand for construction equipment in 2018. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales in EAME increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. The favorable impact of change in dealer inventories resulted from a decrease in 2016 and an increase in 2017. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAlthough construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealer inventories increased in 2017 and decreased in 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END Construction Industries&#8217; profit was $3.258 billion in 2017, compared with $1.650 billion in 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Period costs were unfavorable primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. \n\nResource Industries \n\nResource Industries&#8217; sales were $7.504 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.778 billion, or 31 percent, from 2016. Sales increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies. After a number of years of low investment, miners have begun to increase capital expenditures, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Idle mining trucks on customer sites also decreased in 2017. These changes resulted in higher sales for aftermarket parts to support increased mining activity as well as maintenance and rebuild activities and, by the second half of 2017, resulted in higher end-user demand for mining equipment. Dealer inventories increased in 2017, compared with a significant decrease in 2016. \n\nResource Industries&#8217; profit was $690 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $1.047 billion in 2016. The improvement was partially due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in 2016. Higher sales volume, lower variable manufacturing costs, favorable price realization and lower period costs also contributed to increased profit. Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, to support higher production volumes and decreased in 2016. Period costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions, partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s sales were $15.964 billion in 2017, compared with $14.411 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales in oil and gas and industrial applications. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOil and Gas - Sales increased in North America due to higher sales of reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts used in on-shore gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales in remaining regions were about flat. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIndustrial - Sales were higher in all regions, reflecting increased sales for equipment across end-user applications and aftermarket parts. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nTransportation - Sales were higher primarily in North America for rail services driven by increased rail traffic. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPower Generation - Sales were about flat in all regions as the industry remains challenged. \n\n##TABLE_END Sales into Oil and Gas applications are expected to increase in 2018, led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well servicing in North America. We expect an increase in Transportation primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s profit was $2.883 billion in 2017, compared with $2.222 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower variable manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher period costs. Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material costs. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, compared to a decrease in 2016. The increase in period costs was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nFinancial Products Segment \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; segment revenues were $3.093 billion, an increase of $100 million, or 3 percent, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America and higher average earning assets &#32;in EAME. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific and lower average earning assets in North America and Latin America. \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; segment profit was $792 million in 2017, compared with $702 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services, an increase in net yield on average earning assets and increased intercompany lending activity. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in SG&#38;A expenses due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nAt the end of 2017, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.78 percent, compared with 2.38 percent at the end of 2016. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $114 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $123 million for the full year of 2016. \n\nAs of December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables, compared with $343 million, or 1.29 percent of finance receivables at year-end 2016. \n\nCorporate Items and Eliminations \n\nExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.852 billion in 2017, which was an increase of $140 million compared with 2016. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for ME&#38;T, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. \n\nThe increase in expense was a result of methodology differences, higher restructuring costs, timing differences and an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense, mostly offset by lower mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans. \n\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 &#32;COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2016 &#32; \n\nCONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2016 &#32;(at left) and the fourth quarter of 2017 &#32;(at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. \n\nTotal sales and revenues were $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.322 billion, or 35 percent, compared with $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a decrease of about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers&#8217; demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. \n\nBy segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries, mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s sales volume increased due to higher demand across all applications. Sales volume for Resource Industries increased due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. Favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products&#8217; revenues were about flat. \n\nSales increased across all regions with the largest increase in North America. Sales improved 46 percent in North America primarily due to higher end-user demand for both equipment and aftermarket parts. Changes in dealer inventories were favorable as dealer inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017. EAME sales increased 38 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and favorable price realization. Asia/Pacific sales increased 22 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. About half of the sales improvement in Asia/Pacific was in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. Sales increased 39 percent in Latin America due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels, as well as favorable changes in dealer inventories. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT (LOSS) \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit (Loss) between the fourth quarter of 2016 &#32;(at left) and the fourth quarter of 2017 &#32;(at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit &#32; appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation other operating (income) expenses. \n\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.161 billion, compared with a loss of $1.262 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $2.423 billion was due to higher sales volume, a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. Favorable price realization, lower variable manufacturing costs and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher period costs. Price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. \n\nVariable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory was about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a reduction in inventory in the fourth quarter of 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable due to increases in steel prices. Period costs were higher primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Also contributing to increased period costs were targeted investments and higher manufacturing costs to support higher production volumes, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. \n\nRestructuring costs were $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense was about $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to about $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n\nOther Profit/Loss Items \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nInterest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $169 million, an increase of $49 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to an early debt retirement. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOther income/expense &#32;in the fourth quarter of 2017 was income of $119 million, compared with income of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The favorable change was primarily a result of gains on the sale of securities. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe provision for income taxes &#32;in the fourth quarter reflects an annual effective tax rate of 27.7 percent, compared to 36.4 percent for the full year of 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2017 full-year adjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared to 26 percent in 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 also includes a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write- \n\ndown of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We believe this charge is a reasonable estimate, as of January 18, 2018, that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. Three items partially offset this charge: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA $130 million benefit related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 32 percent to 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective, including the impact of U.S. pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses taxed at higher U.S. rates. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nA tax benefit of $19 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. \n\n##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 also included a charge of $170 million related to the change from the third quarter of 2016 estimated annual tax rate. In addition, the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets was increased in 2016, resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Information \n\n##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region \n\n(Millions of dollars) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160;

The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales volume increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. In addition, there was a favorable impact from changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased more in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPrice realization was favorable due to a weak pricing environment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and previously implemented price increases. \n\n##TABLE_END Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in North America and Asia/Pacific. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn North America, the sales increase was due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to oil and gas, residential and non-residential construction activities. The impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, also contributed to increased sales. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales increased in EAME primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, reflecting improved economic conditions across much of the region. Favorable price realization also contributed to increased sales. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAlthough construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region. \n\n##TABLE_END Construction Industries&#8217; profit was $838 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $334 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization and variable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorable period costs and higher material costs, primarily for steel. The increase in period costs was due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, targeted investments and higher manufacturing period costs to support increased production volumes. \n\nResource Industries \n\nResource Industries&#8217; sales were $2.205 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $762 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in all regions, favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer deliveries for new equipment increased significantly. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies. After several years of low investment, miners began to increase capital expenditures, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Dealer inventories increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a slight decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n\nResource Industries&#8217; profit was $209 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization also contributed to increased profit. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s sales were $4.706 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.849 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOil and Gas &#32;- Sales increased primarily due to higher demand for equipment used in gas compression and well servicing applications in North America. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nTransportation - Sales were higher primarily in North America for rail services, driven by increased rail traffic, and due to additional deliveries of freight locomotives. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIndustrial - Sales were higher primarily in EAME due to increased demand for equipment used in electric power and agricultural end-user applications and aftermarket parts. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPower Generation - Sales increased primarily in EAME due to the timing of projects. \n\n##TABLE_END Energy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s profit was $881 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $638 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher period costs. The increase in period costs was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, costs associated with higher production and targeted investments. \n\nFinancial Products Segment \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; segment revenues were $783 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $41 million, or 6 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, higher average earning assets in EAME and Asia/Pacific and a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific. \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; segment profit was $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an increase in net yield on average earning assets. \n\nCorporate Items and Eliminations \n\nExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $898 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $683 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Corporate items and eliminations include: restructuring costs; corporate-level expenses; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; \n\ncurrency differences for ME&#38;T, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences, as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. \n\nThe decrease in expense was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by methodology differences and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $301 million, compared to mark-to-market losses of $985 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n\n2016 &#32;COMPARED WITH 2015 &#32; \n\nCONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2015 &#32;(at left) and 2016 &#32;(at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal sales and revenues were $38.537 billion in 2016, compared with $47.011 billion in 2015, a decline of $8.474 billion, or 18 percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined, most of the decrease was for new equipment. The unfavorable impact of price realization, primarily in Construction Industries, also contributed to the decline. \n\nSales volume was also unfavorably impacted by changes in dealer machine and engine inventories as inventories decreased about $1.6 billion in 2016 compared with a decrease of about $1.0 billion in 2015. The unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories was primarily in North America. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers&#8217; demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We believe some of the expected dealer inventory reduction is a result of increased machine availability through our factories and product distribution centers. \n\nSales declined in all regions. In North America, sales decreased 19 percent due to lower end-user demand primarily driven by Construction Industries and Energy &#38; Transportation, and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, primarily in Construction Industries. In EAME, sales declined 22 percent, primarily in Africa/Middle East due to weak economic conditions resulting from low oil and other commodity prices and an uncertain investment environment. Sales decreased 29 percent in Latin America, primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region. The most significant decreases were in Mexico and Brazil. Asia/Pacific sales declined 9 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand for Energy &#38; Transportation applications and products used in mining, partially offset by an increase in demand for construction equipment mostly in China. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s sales declined 22 percent, largely due to lower end-user demand for oil and gas and transportation applications. Construction Industries&#8217; sales decreased 12 percent due to lower demand from end users, unfavorable price realization and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Resource Industries&#8217; sales declined 26 percent, mostly due to continued low end-user demand. Financial Products&#8217; segment revenues were about flat. \n\n&#160; \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT \n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2015 &#32;(at left) and 2016 &#32;(at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation other operating (income) expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating profit for 2016 was $498 million, compared with $3.785 billion in 2015. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products. The decrease in profit also included an unfavorable impact from mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. In addition, price realization, Financial Products and restructuring costs were unfavorable. These items were partially offset by favorable period costs and variable manufacturing costs. \n\nThe unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions, primarily in Construction Industries. We saw competitive pressure during 2016 that started in the last half of 2015 driven by excess industry capacity, unfavorable currency pressure as the impact of the strong dollar benefited competitors based outside the United States and an overall weak economic environment. \n\nPeriod costs were lower, primarily due to the impact from substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. The reductions primarily impacted period manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A). Variable manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to improved material costs and the favorable impact of cost absorption. Cost absorption was favorable due to inventory decreasing more significantly in 2015 than in 2016. \n\nRestructuring costs of $1.019 billion in 2016 were related to multiple restructuring actions across the company, primarily in Resource Industries and Energy &#38; Transportation. In 2015, restructuring costs were $898 million. \n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. Expense in 2016 was about $250 million as compared to about $585 million in 2015. \n\nOther Profit/Loss Items \n\nOther income/expense in 2016 was income of $146 million, compared with income of $161 million in 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to the absence of a gain of $120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former third-party logistics business. This was mostly offset by a favorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2016 were significantly less than the net losses in 2015. \n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 36.4 percent compared to 25.5 percent for 2015, excluding the items discussed in the paragraph below. The increase was primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the Surface Mining &#38; Technology &#32;goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting a favorable \n\ngeographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The effective tax rate related to 2016 full-year adjusted profit before tax was 26 percent. \n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a $141 million non-cash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets due to recent U.S. GAAP losses that were expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. The provision for income taxes for 2015 also included a $42 million net charge to adjust prior years&#8217; U.S. taxes. \n\nSegment Information \n\n##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region \n\n(Millions of dollars) \n\n&#160;

The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization. While sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, most of the decrease was for new equipment. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe sales volume decline was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries to end users and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers lowered inventories more significantly in 2016 than in 2015. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPrice realization was unfavorable $539 million due to competitive market conditions resulting from excess industry capacity and an overall weak economic environment. \n\n##TABLE_END Sales decreased in North America, EAME and Latin America and were higher in Asia/Pacific. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand. The sales decline was also due to a decrease in dealer inventories in 2016 compared to relatively flat inventories in 2015. Unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions. The availability of used equipment negatively impacted sales in North America during 2016. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLower sales in EAME were primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. In addition, price realization was unfavorable across the region due to competitive market conditions. Dealer inventories decreased in 2016 while inventories remained flat in 2015. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn Latin America, end-user demand was down across most of the region, with the most significant decline in Brazil due to weak economic conditions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand primarily in China stemming from increased government support in infrastructure and residential investment. In addition, the impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable as inventories increased slightly in 2016 compared to a decrease in inventories in 2015. \n\n##TABLE_END Construction Industries&#8217; profit was $1.650 billion in 2016, compared with $1.865 billion in 2015. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions. The decline was partially offset by favorable costs, primarily due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs, the favorable impact of cost absorption and the absence of an unfavorable impact from litigation in 2015. The impact of cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more significantly in 2015 than in 2016. \n\nResource Industries \n\nResource Industries&#8217; sales were $5.726 billion in 2016, a decrease of $2.013 billion, or 26 percent, from 2015. The decline was almost entirely due to lower sales volume. Sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, however, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Aftermarket parts sales increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters of 2016. \n\nThe sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all regions. While most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year earlier, current prices were not sufficient to drive an increase in short-term demand for new equipment. We believe idle mining trucks on customer sites also had a negative impact on end-user demand. In 2016, mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they had for several years. \n\nResource Industries incurred a loss of $1.047 billion in 2016, compared with profit of $1 million in 2015. The most significant item impacting 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to the Surface Mining &#38; Technology reporting unit. Excluding the impairment charge, the remaining unfavorable change was mostly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. These items were partially offset by lower costs due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation \n\nEnergy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s sales were $14.411 billion in 2016, a decrease of $4.108 billion, or 22 percent, from 2015. The decrease was almost entirely the result of lower sales volume. Sales decreased in all applications with oil and gas and transportation representing nearly 80 percent of the Energy &#38; Transportation decline. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOil and Gas - &#32;Sales continued to decrease in all regions due to low oil prices. Although oil prices were low in 2015 and 2016, our sales during the first half of 2015 benefited from a strong order backlog. The sales decline was most significant in equipment used for production, drilling and well servicing. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nTransportation - Sales decreased in all geographic regions. The most significant decline was in North America, primarily due to significant weakness in the rail industry. Rail remains challenged with low traffic volume and a significant number of idle locomotives. We believe our sales into the rail industry, including rail services and aftermarket, are being negatively impacted by idled fleets resulting from weak commodity prices. In Asia/Pacific, the decrease was due to the absence of a large sale of locomotives in 2015 and a decline in demand for equipment used in marine applications, primarily for work boats. Demand in Latin America and EAME were also negatively impacted by the weakness in the rail industry. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPower Generation &#32;- Sales decreased in all regions, but primarily in EAME. The decline in EAME was primarily a result of continued weakness in the Middle East with continued low oil prices limiting investments. The declines in both North America and Asia/Pacific were primarily due to the absence of several large projects and weakness in power generation demand for oil and gas development. The decline in Latin America was primarily due to weak economic conditions. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nI ndustrial - Sales were lower in EAME, North America and Latin America and about flat in Asia Pacific. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower end-user demand for most industrial applications. \n\n##TABLE_END Energy &#38; Transportation&#8217;s profit was $2.222 billion in 2016, compared with $3.390 billion in 2015. The decline was due to a decrease in sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products. This was partially offset by lower costs primarily due to restructuring and cost reduction actions, favorable material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. \n\nFinancial Products Segment \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; revenues were $2.993 billion, a decrease of $85 million, or 3 percent, from 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, primarily in North America and lower average financing rates in Latin America. These decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America. \n\nFinancial Products&#8217; profit was $702 million in 2016, compared with $809 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, a decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting geographic mix changes and an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in SG&#38;A expenses. \n\nAt the end of 2016, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.38 percent, compared with 2.14 percent at the end of 2015. The increase in past dues was primarily driven by the European marine portfolio. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $123 million for the full-year 2016, compared with $155 million for the full-year 2015. \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $343 million, or 1.29 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $338 million, or 1.22 percent of net finance receivables at year-end 2015. \n\nCorporate Items and Eliminations \n\nExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.712 billion in 2016, which was an increase of $766 million compared with 2015. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for ME&#38;T, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. \n\nThe most significant item was the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market losses in 2016 were $985 million compared to mark-to-market losses of $179 million in 2015. The remaining decrease in expense of $40 million was primarily due to a favorable impact from methodology differences, partially offset by a $121 million increase in restructuring costs. \n\nRESTRUCTURING COSTS \n\nRestructuring costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions of dollars) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee separations 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nContract terminations 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nLong-lived asset impairments 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDefined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal restructuring costs \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,019 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities (all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy &#38; Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. \n\nRestructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. \n\nThe following table summarizes the 2016 &#32;and 2017 &#32;employee separation activity: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions of dollars) \n\n&#160; \n\nLiability balance at December 31, 2015 \n\n$ \n\nIncrease in liability (separation charges) \n\nReduction in liability (payments) \n\n(633 \n\n) \n\nLiability balance at December 31, 2016 \n\n$ \n\nIncrease in liability (separation charges) \n\nReduction in liability (payments) \n\n(423 \n\n) \n\nLiability balance at December 31, 2017 \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMost of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be paid in 2018 and primarily includes employee separation payments related to closure of the Gosselies, Belgium, facility. \n\nIn March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which will lead to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site are expected to be gradually phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under this program to be about $675 million. In 2017, we recognized $653 million of restructuring costs which included $436 million of employee separation costs, $205 million for long-lived asset impairments and $77 million of other costs partially offset by a $65 million LIFO inventory decrement benefit. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2018. \n\nRestructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,019 million. Throughout 2016, we initiated the following restructuring plans: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We recognized $104 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts, which is substantially all the costs expected under this program. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives related to room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs for these plans primarily related to long-lived asset impairments, employee separation costs and inventory write-downs. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nIn September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S., additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures expected to occur through 2018. The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility closure as discussed above. We incurred $817 million, $281 million and $569 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for a total of $1,667 million. We expect to recognize approximately $200 million of additional restructuring costs related to the Plan in 2018. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2018, we expect to incur about $400 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. We are expecting about $250 million of cost reduction in 2018 from lower operating costs, primarily SG&#38;A expenses and Cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring actions. \n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 1. \n\nAdjusted Profit Per Share &#32;- Profit per share excluding restructuring costs and pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses for 2017 and 2016.

Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs primarily for accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, equipment relocation and project management costs and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities (primarily included in Cost of goods sold). \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 20. \n\nSales Volume &#32;- With respect to sales and revenues, sales volume represents the impact of changes in the quantities sold for Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation as well as the incremental revenue impact of new product introductions, including emissions-related product updates. With respect to operating profit, sales volume represents the impact of changes in the quantities sold for Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation combined with product mix as well as the net operating profit impact of new product introductions, including emissions-related product updates. Product mix represents the net operating profit impact of changes in the relative weighting of Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation sales with respect to total sales. The impact of sales volume on segment profit includes inter-segment sales. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 21. \n\nSurface Mining &#38; Technology &#32;- A goodwill reporting unit included in Resource Industries. Its product portfolio includes large mining trucks, electric rope shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels and related parts. In addition to equipment, Surface Mining &#38; Technology also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customer fleet management, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 22. \n\nVariable Manufacturing Costs - &#32; Represents volume-adjusted costs excluding the impact of currency and restructuring costs (see definition above). Variable manufacturing costs are defined as having a direct relationship with the volume of production. This includes material costs, direct labor and other costs that vary directly with production volume such as freight, power to operate machines and supplies that are consumed in the manufacturing process. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\n&#160; \n\nSources of funds \n\n&#160; \n\nWe generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our ME&#38;T operations. Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. During 2017, we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our ME&#38;T and Financial Products' operations. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2017 with $8.26 billion of cash, an increase of $1.09 billion from year-end 2016. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. \n\nOur cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately $7.5 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. U.S. tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. The resulting U.S. tax liability, net of available foreign tax credits, will be payable over eight years, and is not expected to significantly impact liquidity. As a result of this legislation, we expect to be able to use cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries in the United States in the future with minimal U.S. tax consequences. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated operating cash flow for 2017 was $5.70 billion, up slightly from $5.64 billion in 2016. The increase was due to higher profit in 2017 adjusted for non-cash items including a charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation and higher short-term incentive compensation expense accruals. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2017. This improvement was offset by higher working capital requirements and higher pension contributions in 2017. Within working capital, changes to inventory and receivables unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes to accounts payable. These changes to working capital were primarily a result of higher sales volume in 2017 compared to a decrease in sales volume during 2016. In addition, the timing of employee separation payments for 2015 restructuring actions and lower short-term incentive compensation payments in 2017 versus 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow. See further discussion of operating cash flow under ME&#38;T and Financial Products. \n\nTotal debt as of December 31, 2017 was $34.88 billion, a decrease of $1.91 billion from year-end 2016. Debt related to Financial Products decreased $689 million. Debt related to ME&#38;T decreased $1.22 billion in 2017, primarily due to the early redemption of a long term debt issuance. On October 10, 2017, we called for redemption of all $900 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.90% senior notes due in December 2018, payable in cash. The redemption date occurred on November 10, 2017 and included a prepayment fee of $58 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&#38;T as of December 31, 2017 was $2.75 billion. Our three Credit Facilities are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to ME&#38;T) expires in September 2018. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe three-year facility, as amended in September 2017, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to ME&#38;T) expires in September 2020. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe five-year facility, as amended in September 2017, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&#38;T) expires in September 2022. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nAt December 31, 2017, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $13.72 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nAt December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.88 to 1. This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. \n\nIn addition, at December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.38 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.71 to 1. This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. \n\nIn the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. \n\nOur total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2017 &#32;were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2017 \n\n(Millions of dollars) \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated \n\n&#160; \n\nMachinery, \n\nEnergy &#38; \n\nTransportation \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial \n\nProducts \n\nCredit lines available: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGlobal credit facilities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,500 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,750 \n\nOther external \n\n&#160; \n\n4,591 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,590 \n\nTotal credit lines available \n\n&#160; \n\n15,091 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,751 \n\n&#160; \n\n12,340 \n\nLess: Commercial paper outstanding \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,680 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,680 \n\n) \n\nLess: Utilized credit \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,479 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,478 \n\n) \n\nAvailable credit \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,932 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,750 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,182 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2017 &#32;totaled $4.59 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major rating agencies. In December 2016, Moody's Investors Service downgraded our long-term ratings to A3 from A2, and short-term ratings to Prime-2 from Prime-1. The Moody's downgrade did not have a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health. A further downgrade of our credit ratings by Moody's or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. However, our long-term ratings with Fitch and S&#38;P continue to be \"mid-A\". In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, our ME&#38;T operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. \n\nMachinery, Energy &#38; Transportation \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.46 billion in 2017, compared with $3.89 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2017 adjusted for non-cash items including a charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2017. This improvement was offset by higher working capital requirements and higher pension contributions in 2017. Within working capital, changes to inventory and receivables unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes to accounts payable. These changes to working capital were primarily a result of higher sales volume in 2017 compared to a decrease in sales volume during 2016. In addition, the timing of employee separation payments for 2015 restructuring actions and lower short-term incentive compensation payments in 2017 versus 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow. \n\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $760 million, compared with net cash used of $1.78 billion in 2016. The change was primarily due to ME&#38;T lending activity with Financial Products that occurred in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2017. \n\nNet cash used for financing activities during 2017 was $2.58 billion, compared with $2.16 billion in the same period of 2016. The change was primarily due to higher payments on debt in 2017, including the early retirement of $900 million of debt due in December 2018, partially offset by proceeds from common stock issued from stock options exercised in 2017. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur priorities for cash deployment have not changed. While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nStrong financial position &#32; &#8212; &#32;A key measure of ME&#38;T's financial strength used by management is ME&#38;T's debt-to-capital ratio. Debt-to-capital is defined as short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year and long-term debt due after one year (debt) divided by the sum of debt and shareholders' equity. Debt also includes ME&#38;T's long-term borrowings from Financial Products. The debt-to-capital ratio for ME&#38;T was 36.7 percent at December 31, 2017, within our target range of 30 to 45 percent. ME&#38;T's debt-to-capital ratio was 41.0 percent at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the debt-to-capital ratio was primarily driven by a decrease in debt which included an early retirement of $900 million of debt due in December 2018. \n\nOperational requirements and commitments &#32; &#8212; &#32;Capital expenditures were $916 million during 2017, compared to $1.21 billion for the same period in 2016. We expect ME&#38;T's capital expenditures in 2018 to be between $1.0 and $1.5 billion. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.61 billion and $329 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to make approximately $365 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nReturn capital to shareholders &#32; &#8212; &#32;Dividends totaled $1.83 billion in 2017, representing 77 cents per share paid in the first and second quarters and 78 cents per share paid in the third and fourth quarters. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2014 Authorization), which will expire on December 31, 2018. We did not purchase any Caterpillar common stock in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, $5.47 billion remained available under the 2014 Authorization. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017 were approximately 598 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Products \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Products operating cash flow was $1.35 billion in 2017, compared with $1.55 billion in 2016. Net cash used for investing activities was $591 million in 2017, compared with cash provided by investing activities of $299 million in 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of net intercompany purchased receivables, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for equipment on operating leases. Net cash used for financing activities in 2017 was $1.82 billion, compared with $1.07 billion in 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of borrowings with ME&#38;T. \n\n##TABLE_START Dividends paid per common share \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nQuarter \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFirst \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n.700 \n\n&#160; \n\nSecond \n\n&#160; \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n.700 \n\n&#160; \n\nThird \n\n&#160; \n\n.780 \n\n&#160; \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth \n\n&#160; \n\n.780 \n\n&#160; \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n.770 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.100 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.080 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.940 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nContractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nThe company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations.

Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity. \n\nOff-balance sheet arrangements \n\nWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21 &#8211; &#8220;Guarantees and product warranty&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, \n\nreserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each. \n\n&#160; \n\nResidual values for leased assets &#32;&#8211; The residual values for Cat Financial&#8217;s leased assets, which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term, are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action. At the inception of the lease, residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, past remarketing experience, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation. The lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance, to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes. Remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure. \n\nDuring the term of the equipment on operating leases, we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination. Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue. \n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value. \n\nAt December 31, 2017, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.20 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense. \n\nFair values for goodwill impairment tests &#8211; We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. \n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. Beginning in 2017, if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. Prior to 2017, a two-step process was used. For reporting units where we performed the two-step process, the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, the goodwill was not considered impaired. If the carrying value was higher than the fair value, there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference was recognized as an impairment loss. \n\nThe impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company's market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior \n\nmanagement. A reporting unit&#8217;s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. \n\nOur annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Caterpillar&#8217;s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company. \n\nAn unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nImpairment of available-for-sale securities &#32;&#8211; &#160; Available-for-sale securities, primarily at Insurance Services, are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor debt securities, once a security&#8217;s fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers, external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. These reviews, which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment. Securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at any time. Once a security&#8217;s fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months, the security will be other-than-temporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor equity securities in a loss position, determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires an analysis of that security's historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return. This information is utilized to estimate a security&#8217;s future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time. Both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates. \n\nFor both debt and equity securities, qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired. These include reviews of the following: significant changes in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates, and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. \n\n&#160; \n\nWarranty liability &#32;&#8211; At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation &#32;&#8211; We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs). The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nVolatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions. An increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice-based option-pricing model. In determining the expected term of the award, future exercise and forfeiture patterns are estimated from Caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior. These patterns are also affected by the vesting conditions of the award. Changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term. An increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe weighted-average dividend yield is based on Caterpillar&#8217;s historical dividend yields. As holders of stock options and SARs do not receive dividend payments, this could result in employees retaining the award for a longer period of time if dividend yields decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yields increase. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant. As the risk-free interest rate increases, the expected term increases, resulting in an increase in our expense. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe fair value of our RSUs and PRSUs is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillar&#8217;s quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant. A decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense. \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based compensation expense recognized based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period they occur as a reduction to expense. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest. Changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve &#32;&#8211; We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. \n\n&#160; \n\nPostretirement benefits &#32;&#8211; Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today&#8217;s dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar&#8217;s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent) are excluded from the analysis. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nDiscount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. \n\nSee Note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\nPost-sale discount reserve &#32;&#8211; We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1,426 million and $1,288 million as of December 31, 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material. \n\n&#160; \n\nCredit loss reserve &#32;&#8211; The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. \n\nAccounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables&#8217; effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. \n\nWhile management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. \n\nIncome taxes &#32;&#8211; We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. \n\nDespite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#8217;s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\nIncome taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation. That statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated. Taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate in part due to profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which were generally lower than the U.S. rate of 35 percent effective prior to January 1, 2018. Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), primarily taxable locally in Switzerland, contributes the most significant amount of this difference. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the \n\nUnited States profits earned from certain parts transactions by CSARL based on the IRS examination team&#8217;s application of &#8220;substance-over-form&#8221; or &#8220;assignment-of-income&#8221; judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. Therefore, we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. \n\nOur income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation was enacted containing a broad range of tax reform provisions including a corporate tax rate reduction and changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings. We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. However, we have made a reasonable estimate of the 2017 financial statement impact as of January 18, 2018, and recognized a provisional charge of $2.371 billion. We will continue to update our calculations as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. These updates could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. \n\nThe provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the law and refining our calculations of basis differences as of December 31, 2017, which could affect the measurement of these balances. \n\nThe provisionally estimated charge includes $1.775 billion for the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. The U.S. federal tax cost for the mandatory deemed repatriation is computed at 15.5 percent for non-U.S. earnings held in liquid assets and 8 percent for non-liquid assets, reduced by applicable foreign tax credits. These estimates are provisional due to additional information and analysis required to determine cumulative taxable earnings since 1986 for non-U.S. subsidiaries at two separate points in time and to determine the amount of earnings that are held in liquid versus non-liquid assets as defined in the new legislation at several different measurement periods. In addition, information is being gathered and analyzed to support available foreign tax credits including estimates of credit utilization and valuation allowance considerations for any remaining foreign tax credit carryforward. Due to uncertainty about aspects of the tax law, we have made various assumptions to determine our reasonable estimate that we expect to refine as additional guidance is issued. \n\nAs a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not expected to cause a significant U.S. tax impact in the future. However, these distributions may be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of $138 million for withholding taxes in non-U.S. jurisdictions where earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Additional information and analysis are needed to determine the final amount of deferred tax liability considering factors such as whether non-U.S. entities are subject to withholding taxes, have reserve requirements, or have projected working capital and other capital needs in the country where the earnings were generated that would result in a decision to indefinitely reinvest a portion or all their earnings. \n\nDeferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2016 included an increase in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent. The primary driver of the increase was recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. Due to better than previously forecasted 2017 U.S. GAAP results in certain U.S. state jurisdictions, the provision for income taxes for 2017 includes a decrease in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $111 million non-cash benefit, net of federal deferred tax adjustment of 35 percent. We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\n&#160; \n\nENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS \n\nThe &#32; Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. \n\nWe are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. \n\nOn January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Company&#8217;s understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\nOn March 20, 2014, Brazil&#8217;s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 &#32;companies and over 100 &#32;individuals as defendants, including two &#32;subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servi&#231;os Ferrovi&#225;rios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two &#32;current employees of MGE and one &#32;former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\nOn October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California related to the former railcar repair operations of its subsidiary, United Industries, LLC (\"United\") at the intermodal rail yard at Terminal Island, California (\"Terminal Island\"). United complied with the subpoena and cooperated with the U.S. Attorney. After investigation, the U.S. Attorney alleged that United engaged in unnecessary and improper railcar repair activities and disposed of railcar parts by hand in the water surrounding its former Terminal Island operation. On December 7, 2017, United entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to a single misdemeanor violation of the Refuse Act. As part of the agreement to enter the plea, United has paid $25 million in fines and restitution. \n\nIn addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these \n\nunresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \n\n&#160; \n\nRETIREMENT BENEFITS \n\nWe recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. \n\nWe recognized expense of $342 million in 2017, $957 million in 2016 and $292 million in 2015 related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net mark-to-market losses in 2017 compared to 2016. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credits, curtailment and termination charges in 2017 related to the Gosselies, Belgium and Aurora, Illinois facility closures and a lower expected return on plan assets. The increase in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher net mark-to-market loss in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower expected return on plan assets as a result of a lower asset base in 2016 compared to 2015 and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets. This was partially offset by lower interest costs primarily due to adoption of a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost (discussed below) and lower service costs primarily due to fewer employees earning benefits under our plans as a result of the U.S. voluntary retirement enhancement program that was implemented in the fourth quarter 2015. \n\nThe primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 are described below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n2017 net mark-to-market loss of $301 million &#32;- Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 and changes in our mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 15.5 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.7 percent). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n2016 net mark-to-market loss of $985 million &#32;- Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 and changes in our U.S. mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 7.8 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.9 percent). \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\n2015 net mark-to-market loss of $179 million &#32;- Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of (2.0) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 7.4 percent) which was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2015 compared to 2014. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nThe net mark-to-market losses were in the following Results of Operations line items: ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(Millions of dollars) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of goods sold \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(29 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to the presentation of net periodic pension and OPEB costs. This guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. Service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations. As a result, components of pension and OPEB costs, other than service costs, will be reclassified from operating costs to other income/expense. This change will be applied retrospectively to prior years. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our U.S. pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants. As of December 31, 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $290 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the SoA for our U.S. pension and OPEB plans. As of December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $200 million. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits. In March 2017, we recognized a net loss of $20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits. In addition, we announced the decision to phase out production at our Aurora, Illinois, facility, which resulted in termination benefits of $9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our U.S. hourly defined benefit pension plan. \n\nBeginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by $140 million and $180 million, respectively, under the new method than they would have been under the previous method. This change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and OPEB obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss (gain) reported for the respective year. \n\nWe expect our total defined benefit pension and OPEB expense (excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses) to decrease approximately $80 million in 2018. This decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 2018. \n\nIn general, our strategy for both the U.S. and the non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. For our U.S. pension plans, our year-end 2017 asset allocation was 34 percent equities, 62 percent fixed income and 4 percent other. Our current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income. The target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. \n\nThe year-end 2017 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 40 percent equities, 53 percent fixed income, 4 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The 2017 weighted-average target allocations for our non-U.S. pension plans was 38 percent equities, 54 percent fixed income, 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of the plan participants and funded status. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. \n\nContributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.6 billion and $329 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 contributions include a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our U.S. pension plans in December 2017. We expect to make approximately $365 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans. \n\nActuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and OPEB expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2017 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;

\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSENSITIVITY \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Exchange Rate Sensitivity \n\n&#160; \n\nMachinery, Energy &#38; Transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2018 &#32;cash flow for our Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation operations by approximately $193 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a \n\npotential $143 million adverse impact on 2017 &#32;cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity. \n\n&#160; \n\nSince our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. \n\nThe effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen, British pound, Indian rupee, euro and Australian dollar. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity \n\n&#160; \n\nFor our Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation operations, we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2018 &#32;pre-tax earnings of Machinery, Energy &#38; Transportation. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2017 pre-tax earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2017 &#32;balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential $5 million adverse impact on 2018 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $6 million adverse impact to 2017 &#32;pre-tax earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nThis analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\nThe following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. \n\nWe believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) state deferred tax valuation allowance (reversal), (iv) a gain on the sale of an equity investment, (v) U.S. tax reform impact and (vi) goodwill impairment charges. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results. \n\nReconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit (loss) before taxes, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThree Months Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, \n\n(millions of dollars) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProfit (Loss) before taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,111 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,348 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,082 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nRestructuring costs \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,019 \n\nMark-to-market losses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nGain on sale of equity investment \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(85 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nGoodwill impairment \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\nAdjusted profit before taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,657 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,554 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nReconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThree Months Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nProfit (Loss) per share - diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2.18 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2.00 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.26 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.11 \n\n) \n\nPer share restructuring costs 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.31 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.45 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.68 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.16 \n\nPer share mark-to-market losses 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.26 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.14 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.26 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.15 \n\nPer share state deferred tax valuation allowance (reversal) 3 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.18 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.24 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.18 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.24 \n\nPer share gain on sale of equity investment 2 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(0.09 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nPer share U.S. tax reform impact \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.91 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.95 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\nPer share goodwill impairment 4 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.98 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.98 \n\nAdjusted profit per share \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.16 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n0.83 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6.88 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3.42 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1 At statutory tax rates prior to consideration of U.S. tax reform.
