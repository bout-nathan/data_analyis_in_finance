(\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through our operations, we help people around the world save money and live better &#8211; anytime and anywhere &#8211; in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping into an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail, or eCommerce, is comprised of our eCommerce websites, mobile commerce applications and transactions involving both an eCommerce platform and a physical format, which we refer to as omni-channel. Each week, we serve nearly 270 million &#32;customers who visit our more than 11,700 &#32;stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 65 &#32;banners in 28 &#32;countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. By leading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our physical and digital presence, in which we are investing to integrate into a seamless omni-channel, provides customers convenient access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great shopping experience through whichever shopping method they prefer. \n\nOur operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats and eCommerce, as well as an omni-channel offering. Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWalmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These categories, including eCommerce, consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash &#38; carry. Overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown in recent years by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding eCommerce. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nSam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as eCommerce through samsclub.com. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. \n\n##TABLE_END Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31 &#32;for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . \n\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 &#32;(\"fiscal 2018 \"), January 31, 2017 &#32;(\"fiscal 2017 \") and January 31, 2016 &#32;(\"fiscal 2016 \") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. \n\nThroughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. \n\nComparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to eCommerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n\nIn discussing our operating results, we use the term \"currency exchange rates\" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. \n\nThe Retail Industry \n\nWe operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees (\"associates\"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \" Item 1A. Risk Factors ,\" and under \" Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements .\" \n\nCompany Performance Metrics \n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. Our financial framework is defined as: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nstrong, efficient growth; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\noperating discipline; and \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nstrategic capital allocation. \n\n##TABLE_END As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. \n\nStrong, Efficient Growth \n\nOur objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on increasing comparable sales and eCommerce sales growth while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company, which may not benefit comparable sales in the near term. \n\nComparable sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. \n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWith Fuel \n\n&#160; \n\nFuel Impact \n\nWalmart U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.0% \n\nSam's Club \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.9)% \n\nTotal U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1)% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nComparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, &#32; increased 2.2% &#32;and 1.4% &#32;in fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The fiscal 2018 &#32;total U.S. comparable sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement, higher eCommerce sales and the impact of higher fuel sales. eCommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.7% &#32;for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club for fiscal 2018 . The fiscal 2017 total U.S. comparable sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher eCommerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. eCommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.4% and 0.7% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2017 . \n\nIn the past, when we were focused on adding new stores and clubs in the U.S., we did so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units. We reduced the number of new store and club openings in fiscal 2018 and the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of these openings was not significant. We expect this trend to continue in the future as well. In fiscal 2017 , we estimate the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.7%. Our estimate was calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened. \n\nOperating Discipline \n\nWe operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n495,761 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n481,317 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n% \n\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n106,510 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n101,853 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n4.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n% \n\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n21.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n21.2 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFor fiscal 2018 , operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 &#32; basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion of charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, approximately $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, a legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to Walmart U.S. discontinued real estate projects, and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. \n\nStrategic Capital Allocation \n\nWe are allocating more capital to remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping. The following table provides additional detail: \n\n##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\nAllocation of Capital Expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNew stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,171 \n\nRemodels \n\n&#160; \n\n2,009 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,589 \n\neCommerce, technology, supply chain and other \n\n&#160; \n\n4,521 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,162 \n\nTotal U.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n7,444 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,922 \n\nWalmart International \n\n&#160; \n\n2,607 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,697 \n\nTotal capital expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,051 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,619 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTotal U.S. capital expenditures decreased $478 million &#32;for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures related to new stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations, decreased $1.3 billion , partially offset by increases to capital expenditures for remodels and for eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other. These changes were a result of our shift in capital allocation strategy to support growth in comparable store and club sales and eCommerce, while slowing the rate at which we open new stores and clubs. \n\nReturns \n\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. We measure returns on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources &#32;section. \n\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment \n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% &#32;and 7.2% &#32;for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. The decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 . ROI was 14.2% &#32;and 15.2% &#32;for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. The decline in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 . \n\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations. \n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. \n\nAlthough ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. \n\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS \n\nNumerator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nConsolidated net income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,523 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,293 \n\nDenominator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage total assets (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n201,674 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n199,203 \n\nReturn on assets (ROA) \n\n&#160; \n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n7.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT \n\nNumerator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,764 \n\n+ Interest income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n+ Depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n10,529 \n\n&#160; \n\n10,080 \n\n+ Rent \n\n&#160; \n\n2,932 \n\n&#160; \n\n2,612 \n\n= Adjusted operating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34,050 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n35,556 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDenominator \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage total assets (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n201,674 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n199,203 \n\n+ Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n79,995 \n\n&#160; \n\n74,245 \n\n- Average accounts payable (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n43,763 \n\n&#160; \n\n39,960 \n\n- Average accrued liabilities (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n21,388 \n\n&#160; \n\n20,131 \n\n+ Rent x 8 \n\n&#160; \n\n23,456 \n\n&#160; \n\n20,896 \n\n= Average invested capital \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n239,974 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n234,253 \n\nReturn on investment (ROI) \n\n&#160; \n\n14.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n15.2 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of January 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain Balance Sheet Data \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal assets \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n204,522 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n198,825 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n199,581 \n\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization \n\n&#160; \n\n83,039 \n\n&#160; \n\n76,951 \n\n&#160; \n\n71,538 \n\nAccounts payable \n\n&#160; \n\n46,092 \n\n&#160; \n\n41,433 \n\n&#160; \n\n38,487 \n\nAccrued liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n22,122 \n\n&#160; \n\n20,654 \n\n&#160; \n\n19,607 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32;(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. &#32; &#32;Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources &#32;for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. \n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion &#32;and $27.6 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $18.3 billion , $21.1 billion &#32;and $16.1 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. The decreases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 &#32;from fiscal 2017 &#32;were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management &#32;and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2017 &#32;from fiscal 2016 &#32;was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. \n\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . \n\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. \n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,337 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,673 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,552 \n\nPayments for property and equipment \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,051 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(10,619 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(11,477 \n\n) \n\nFree cash flow \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18,286 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21,054 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,075 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9,060 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(13,987 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(10,675 \n\n) \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n(19,875 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(19,072 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(16,285 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nConsolidated Results of Operations \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n500,343 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n485,873 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n482,130 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.7 \n\n)% \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n495,761 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n481,317 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n478,614 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.7 \n\n)% \n\nTotal U.S. calendar comparable sales increase \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\nGross profit rate \n\n&#160; \n\n24.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n24.6 \n\n&#160;% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20,437 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n22,764 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24,105 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n4.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n4.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.0 \n\n&#160;% \n\nConsolidated net income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,523 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14,293 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15,080 \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n11,718 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,695 \n\n&#160; \n\n11,528 \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n1,158 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,164 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,149 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $14.5 billion &#32;or 3.0% &#32;and $3.7 billion or 0.8% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales &#32; increased $14.4 billion &#32;or 3.0% &#32; and $2 .7 billion or 0.6% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions . Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses &#32;and the $0.5 billion &#32;of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2017 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth in consolidated retail square feet. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 &#32;was partially offset by a negative impact of $11.0 billion or 2.3% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $0.4 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. \n\nOur gross profit rate decreased 26 &#32;basis points for fiscal 2018 &#32;and increased 36 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Additionally, improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs in the Walmart International segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal 2017 . \n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 &#32;and 88 basis points for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, approximately $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, a legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter in the third quarter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S., and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from the continued investment in associate wage structure, a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and severance, and our \n\ncontinued investments in eCommerce and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2017 &#32;was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. \n\nMembership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 &#32;and increased $1.0 billion for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 &#32;included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia, a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal &#32; 2017 . Fiscal 2017 &#32;included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile. \n\nFor fiscal 2018, loss on extinguishment of debt was $3.1 billion , due to the early extinguishment of long-term debt which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 30.4% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 30.3% &#32;for both fiscal 2017 &#32;and 2016 . Although relatively consistent year-over-year, our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 &#32;is presented in Note 9 &#32;in the \" Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \" and describes the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") to the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate. \n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $10.5 billion &#32;and $14.3 billion &#32;of consolidated net income for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.8 billion &#32;and $0.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (\"EPS\") was $3.28 &#32;and $4.38 &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. \n\nWalmart U.S. Segment \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n318,477 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n307,833 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n298,378 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n3.5 \n\n% \n\n3.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n% \n\nCalendar comparable sales increase \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,869 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n17,745 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19,087 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n5.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n5.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n6.4 \n\n% \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n4,761 \n\n4,672 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,574 \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n699 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $10.6 billion &#32;or 3.5% &#32;and $9.5 billion or 3.2% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.1% &#32;and 1.6% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, and year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 0.7% &#32;and 1.4% for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively.

The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 &#32;was primarily due to declining sales on relatively flat fixed costs in the United Kingdom, as well as adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairment charges in certain markets. \n\nSegment operating income was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $68 million &#32;and $642 million for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $406 million &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and increased $412 million for fiscal 2017 , respectively. \n\nSam's Club Segment \n\nWe believe the information in the below table under the caption \"Excluding Fuel\" is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncluding Fuel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n59,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n57,365 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n56,828 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.1 \n\n)% \n\nCalendar comparable sales increase (decrease) \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.2 \n\n)% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,671 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,820 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n2.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.2 \n\n&#160;% \n\nUnit counts at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n660 \n\n&#160; \n\nRetail square feet at period end \n\n&#160; \n\n88 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nExcluding Fuel \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n54,456 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n53,289 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n52,330 \n\nPercentage change from comparable period \n\n&#160; \n\n2.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160;% \n\nOperating income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,619 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,746 \n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n&#160;% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#32; \n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.9 billion &#32;or 3.2% &#32;and $0.5 billion or 0.9% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion &#32;in fuel sales from higher fuel prices in fiscal 2018 . For fiscal 2017 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales without fuel driven by higher eCommerce sales, and a year-over-year increase in retail square feet of 0.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in fuel sales primarily from lower fuel prices in fiscal 2017 . In the future, net sales will be negatively impacted by our decision to remove tobacco in certain clubs. \n\nGross profit rate decreased 44 &#32;basis points for fiscal 2018 &#32;and increased 39 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to the club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, higher inventory shrink, increased shipping costs at samsclub.com and the investment in cash rewards. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to margin rate improvement in home and apparel, health and wellness, and grocery, partially offset by changes in merchandise mix and the growth of the Cash Rewards program. \n\nMembership and other income increased 2.3% &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and decreased 6.5% for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by an increase of 2.3% in membership income as a result of increased Plus Member renewals. \n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 80 &#32;and 49 basis points for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage, benefit and incentive expenses from the investment in the associate wage structure, as well as our investments in eCommerce and technology and an increase in advertising expense. \n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $689 million &#32;and $149 million f or fiscal &#32; 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nLiquidity \n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. \n\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28,337 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31,673 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n27,552 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion &#32;and $27.6 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management &#32;and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. &#32;&#32; \n\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital \n\nCash and cash equivalents were $6.8 billion &#32;and $6.9 billion &#32;at January 31, 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $18.9 billion &#32;and $9.2 billion &#32;at January 31, 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit reflects an increase in short-term borrowings as part of our long-term debt extinguishment activity as well as improved procurement and inventory management. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. \n\nWe use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. As part of U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, we are currently assessing the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact our assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under new U.S. tax laws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nAs of January 31, 2018 &#32;and 2017 , cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion &#32;and $1.0 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. \n\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(9,060 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(13,987 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(10,675 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $9.1 billion , $14.0 billion &#32;and $10.7 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments to remodel existing stores and clubs, expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies and add stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.9 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 &#32;included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico, while fiscal 2017 &#32;included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. (\"jet.com\") for approximately $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of available for sale securities in JD.com (\"JD\"). Net cash used in investing activities increased $3.3 billion for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD, partially offset by $0.7 billion in cash received from the sales of shopping malls in Chile. Refer to Note 13 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the \" Strategic Capital Allocation \" section in our Company Performance Metrics &#32;for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2018 and 2017. \n\nWe continued to focus on eCommerce, including a seamless omni-channel shopping experience, in each of our segments during fiscal 2018 . Our fiscal 2018 &#32;accomplishments in this area include growing \"Online Grocery\" to over 1,100 pickup locations in the U.S., new dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, two-day free shipping with no membership fee at Walmart U.S. and one-hour delivery from stores in China. \n\nGrowth Activities \n\nFor the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 &#32;(\"fiscal 2019 \"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion and involve: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nin Walmart U.S., continuing to prioritize store remodels and digital experiences, with approximately 1,000 additional online grocery locations; \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nin Walmart International, investing more in fulfillment capabilities in addition to new stores; and, \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\neCommerce investments that include enhanced supply chain capabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END Globally, in fiscal 2019 , we expect to add approximately 280 new, expanded or relocated stores and clubs, with approximately 255 of those in Walmart International, focusing on key markets such as Mexico and China. \n\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(19,875 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(19,072 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(16,285 \n\n) \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interests are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion &#32;and $2.8 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 &#32;and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2018 &#32;increased due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt. Net cash used in financing \n\nactivities for fiscal 2017 &#32;increased primarily due to repurchases of Company stock partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major category below. \n\nShort-term Borrowings \n\nNet cash flows provided by short-term borrowings increased $4.1 billion &#32;in fiscal 2018 &#32;and decreased $1.7 billion &#32;in fiscal 2017 , when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2018 , the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings was due to improved cash flows from operations driven by working capital improvements and changes to tax regulations. \n\nThe following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,386 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9,493 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,551 \n\nAverage daily short-term borrowings \n\n&#160; \n\n8,131 \n\n&#160; \n\n5,691 \n\n&#160; \n\n4,536 \n\nAnnual weighted-average interest rate \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to our short-term borrowings, we also have various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. that provide $12.5 billion &#32;and various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. that provide approximately $4.0 billion of additional liquidity, if needed. \n\nLong-term Debt \n\nThe following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2018 : ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt due within one year \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nBalances as of February 1, 2017 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,256 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n36,015 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38,271 \n\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,476 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,476 \n\nPayments of long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,789 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(11,272 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n(13,061 \n\n) \n\nReclassifications of long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n3,224 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,224 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,050 \n\n&#160; \n\n1,097 \n\nBalances as of January 31, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,738 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,045 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33,783 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur total long-term debt decreased $4.5 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt. The extinguishment of certain long-term debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . \n\nDividends \n\nOur total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.2 billion &#32;and $6.3 billion &#32;for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 , respectively. On February 20, 2018 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2019 &#32;annual dividend of $2.08 &#32;per share, an increase over the fiscal 2018 &#32;annual dividend of $2.04 &#32;per share. For fiscal 2019 , the annual dividend will be paid in four &#32;quarterly installments of $0.52 &#32;per share, according to the following record and payable dates: \n\n##TABLE_START Record Date \n\n&#160; \n\nPayable Date \n\nMarch 9, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nApril 2, 2018 \n\nMay 11, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nJune 4, 2018 \n\nAugust 10, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 4, 2018 \n\nDecember 7, 2018 \n\n&#160; \n\nJanuary 2, 2019 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCompany Share Repurchase Program \n\nFrom time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 20, 2017 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018 . On October 9, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion &#32;share repurchase program which, beginning on November 20, 2017, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2018 , authorization for $18.8 billion &#32;of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. \n\nWe regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significant majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be \n\nfunded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2018 , 2017 &#32;and 2016 : ##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal number of shares repurchased \n\n&#160; \n\n104.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n119.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n62.4 \n\nAverage price paid per share \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n79.11 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n69.18 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n65.90 \n\nTotal amount paid for share repurchases \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,296 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,298 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,112 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nShare repurchases were flat for fiscal 2018 &#32;and increased $4.2 billion &#32;for fiscal 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. \n\nSignificant Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests \n\nIn fiscal 2016, as described in Note 13 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian, our eCommerce operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete the transaction. The Company subsequently sold Yihaodian to JD in fiscal 2017. \n\nCapital Resources \n\nWe believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases. \n\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. At January 31, 2018 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Rating agency \n\n&#160; \n\nCommercial paper \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt \n\nStandard &#38; Poor's \n\n&#160; \n\nA-1+ \n\n&#160; \n\nAA \n\nMoody's Investors Service \n\n&#160; \n\nP-1 \n\n&#160; \n\nAa2 \n\nFitch Ratings \n\n&#160; \n\nF1+ \n\n&#160; \n\nAA \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2018 : \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, \n\n(Amounts in millions) \n\nTotal \n\n2020-2021 \n\n2022-2023 \n\nThereafter \n\nRecorded contractual obligations: \n\nLong-term debt (1) \n\n$ \n\n33,783 \n\n$ \n\n3,733 \n\n$ \n\n5,250 \n\n$ \n\n3,541 \n\n$ \n\n21,259 \n\nShort-term borrowings \n\n5,257 \n\n5,257 \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\nCapital lease and financing obligations (2) \n\n9,930 \n\n1,039 \n\n1,929 \n\n1,539 \n\n5,423 \n\nUnrecorded contractual obligations: \n\nNon-cancelable operating leases (3) \n\n15,366 \n\n1,933 \n\n3,250 \n\n2,539 \n\n7,644 \n\nEstimated interest on long-term debt \n\n17,601 \n\n1,291 \n\n2,319 \n\n2,121 \n\n11,870 \n\nTrade and stand-by letters of credit \n\n2,626 \n\n2,626 \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\nPurchase obligations \n\n13,278 \n\n6,121 \n\n5,094 \n\n1,138 \n\nTotal contractual obligations \n\n$ \n\n97,841 \n\n$ \n\n22,000 \n\n$ \n\n17,842 \n\n$ \n\n10,878 \n\n$ \n\n47,121 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\n\"Long-term debt\" includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \n\n\"Capital lease and financing obligations\" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and financing obligations that are not yet recorded. Refer to Note 11 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) \n\nRepresents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2018 . \n\n##TABLE_END Additionally, the Company has $12.5 billion &#32;in undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $4.0 billion of undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nEstimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2018 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. \n\nPurchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Additionally, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. \n\nThe expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. \n\nIn addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.0 billion &#32;of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nAs of January 31, 2018 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \n\nOther Matters \n\nWe discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters, including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A &#32;of this Form 10-K under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and under the sub-caption \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 10 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies,\" and appears elsewhere herein.

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. \n\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. \n\nInventories \n\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. \n\nUnder the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's retail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could also cause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. \n\nWhen necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. At January 31, 2018 &#32;and 2017 , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. \n\nWe provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annual inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results. Historically, our estimated inventory losses have been materially accurate when compared to annual inventory counts and we expect that trend to continue. \n\nImpairment of Assets \n\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in \n\ndemographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Although impairment charges for fiscal 2018 &#32;were $1.4 billion , these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in &#32; Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material and would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment. Additionally, total impairment charges for fiscal &#32; 2017 &#32;were not material. \n\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. \n\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. \n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates. \n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $0.2 billion &#32;related to the enactment of the Tax Act. The benefit primarily related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the Tax Act's newly enacted tax rates and is net of the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. As discussed in Note 9 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act is provisional and will be completed by the measurement period provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. \n\n##TABLE_START "}
