As described in Note 16, effective in the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. Any references to &#8220;Membrana&#8221; refer to the former Separations Media business acquired by 3M from Polypore in 2015. \n\n&#160; \n\nEarnings per share (EPS) attributable to 3M common shareholders &#8211; diluted: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table provides the increase (decrease) in diluted earnings per share for 2016 compared to 2015, and 2015 compared to 2014. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n(Earnings per diluted share) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSame period last year \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.58 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.49 &#160; \n\nIncrease/(decrease) in earnings per share - diluted, due to: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperational benefits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.16 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.42 &#160; \n\n2015 restructuring charges \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.14 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.14) &#160; \n\nAcquisitions and divestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.14 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.02) &#160; \n\nForeign exchange impacts \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.14) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.43) &#160; \n\nNet interest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.05) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.02) &#160; \n\nIncome tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.09 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares of common stock outstanding \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.24 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.28 &#160; \n\nCurrent period \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8.16 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n7.58 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2016 versus Year 2015 EPS: \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2016, net income attributable to 3M was $5.050 billion, or $8.16 per diluted share, compared to $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, in 2015, an increase of 7.7 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits increased earnings, helped by lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expenses. Operational benefits also included the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, in addition to productivity benefits \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nrelated to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. These operational benefits were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset utilization. Restructuring actions resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of Membrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to earnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts. \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 14 cents per diluted share for 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nOver the past few years, 3M has taken actions to better optimize its capital structure and reduce its cost of capital by adding debt. These actions have led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016, largely due to higher average debt balances. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year. The 2016 change in tax rate was driven by a number of factors as referenced in Note 8, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09 (discussed in Note 1). \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2016 declined 3 percent versus last year, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits from share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which increased the calculated number of diluted shares in 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to the section entitled &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; for further discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2015 versus Year 2014 EPS: \n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. Restructuring actions (discussed in Note 4) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in France and substantially all of the library systems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven by average year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and Brazil Real of 30 percent. The income tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year to 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents. Refer to the section entitled &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; for further discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2016 sales and operating income results: &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth-quarter 2016 net income attributable to 3M was $1.155 billion, or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to $1.038 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth-quarter 2016 sales totaled $7.3 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Organic-local currency sales increased 1.6 percent, with organic volume increases of 1.5 percent and higher selling prices contributing 0.1 percent. Divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percent, which related to the fourth quarter 2015 sale of both the license plate converting business in France, along with substantially all of the library systems business. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nprotective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8 percent year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a business segment perspective, 3M achieved organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Health Care, with declines in Electronics and Energy, and Consumer. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn an organic local-currency sales basis: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales increased 4.6 percent in Industrial, with sales growth led by automotive OEM, advanced materials, separation and purification, and automotive aftermarket. Sales declined in aerospace and commercial transportation. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales increased 2.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, with sales increases in roofing granules, personal safety, and commercial solutions. Sales declined in traffic safety and security. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales increased 1.3 percent in Health Care, with sales increases in food safety, critical and chronic care, drug delivery systems, and infection prevention. Sales declined slightly in oral care, as this business continued to be impacted by soft end-market conditions and channel inventory adjustments. Health information systems also declined due to a slower rate of software installations in a tougher market over the past year, along with a challenging comparison against last year&#8217;s fourth quarter. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales decreased 0.6 percent in Electronics and Energy. Electronics-related sales were flat, with growth in electronics materials solutions more than offset by a decline in display materials and systems. This was an improvement over recent quarters as end-market conditions and channel inventories became more stable. Energy-related sales declined 2 percent as growth in telecommunications markets was offset by declines in electrical markets, and renewable energy. In December 2015, 3M exited its backsheet business in renewable energy, which reduced energy-related organic sales by 3.5 percent year-on-year. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales decreased 0.7 percent in the Consumer business segment. Despite channel inventory adjustments, 3M posted organic growth in the home improvement, consumer health care, and home care businesses. The stationery and office supplies business, which was most impacted by channel inventory adjustments, declined year-on-year. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 2016 organic local-currency sales increased in Latin America/Canada, Asia Pacific, and the United States. Organic local-currency sales declined in EMEA. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn an organic local-currency sales basis: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales in Latin America/Canada increased 4.1 percent. 3M saw growth in four of its five business segments, led by Health Care. Sales in Mexico increased 10 percent, Canada was up 3 percent and Brazil increased 1 percent. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nSales in Asia Pacific increased 2.4 percent, led by Health Care and Consumer. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia Pacific, sales increased 6 percent in China/Hong Kong, and increased 3 percent in Japan. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, China/Hong Kong was up 11 percent and Japan grew 2 percent. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales in the United States increased 1.2 percent, led by Industrial, Health Care, and Safety and Graphics. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#183; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales in EMEA declined 2.4 percent. West Europe declined 1 percent, as growth in Safety and Graphics, and Industrial, was more than offset by declines in other business groups. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa declined 6 percent, impacted by ongoing challenges in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which 3M expects to persist in the near term. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 22.7 percent of sales, compared to 20.5 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 2.2 percentage points. The year-on-year comparison related to 2015 restructuring charges increased operating income margins by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, lower pension/postretirement benefit costs, raw material cost decreases, year-on-year divestiture gains, and productivity benefits improved operating income margins. These benefits were partially offset by strategic investments and legal costs, with these items discussed on an annual basis in the &#8220;Operating income margin&#8221; section. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2016 sales and operating income results: &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales totaled $30.1 billion, a decrease of 0.5 percent from 2015. Organic local-currency sales declined 0.1 percent, with organic volumes declines of 0.8 percent largely offset by selling price increases of 0.7 percent. Acquisitions added 1.2 percent to sales, while divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percent. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.2 percent year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales increased 3.5 percent in Health Care, 2.2 percent in Safety and Graphics, 1.9 percent in Consumer, and were flat in Industrial, while sales declined 7.5 percent in Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2016 organic local-currency sales grew 3.7 percent in Latin America/Canada, 0.5 percent in the United States, 0.4 percent in EMEA, and declined 2.8 percent in Asia Pacific. Refer to the sections entitled &#8220;Performance by Business Segment&#8221; and &#8220;Performance by Geographic Area&#8221; for additional detail. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2016 was 24.0 percent of sales, compared to 22.9 percent of sales in 2015, an increase of 1.1 percentage points. Restructuring actions resulted in a pre-tax charge of $114 million in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016. These results also included a benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, plus lower pension/postretirement benefit costs. Refer to the section entitled &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; for further discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2015 sales and operating income results: &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales totaled $30.3 billion, a decrease of 4.9 percent from 2014. Organic local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing 0.2 percent and selling price increases contributing 1.1 percent. Acquisitions added 0.8 percent to sales, while divestitures reduced sales by 0.2 percent. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 6.8 percent year-on-year. \n\n&#160; \n\nFrom a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales increased 3.7 percent in Health Care, 3.4 percent in Consumer, 2.4 percent in Safety and Graphics, and 0.4 percent in Industrial, while sales declined 1.5 percent in Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2015 organic local-currency sales grew 2.1 percent in the United States, 1.5 percent in Latin America/Canada, 0.9 percent in Asia Pacific, and 0.8 percent in EMEA. Refer to the sections entitled &#8220;Performance by Business Segment&#8221; and &#8220;Performance by Geographic Area&#8221; for additional detail. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income in 2015 was 22.9 percent of sales, compared to 22.4 percent of sales in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. These results included a benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs and 2015 restructuring charges.

Organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) declined 0.1 percent, acquisitions added 1.2 percent, and divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percent. Sales in U.S. dollars increased in Safety and Graphics by 2.6 percent, Health Care by 2.0 percent, Consumer by 1.3 percent, and Industrial by 0.2 percent, while sales in Electronics and Energy declined 8.1 percent. All of 3M&#8217;s five business segments posted operating income margins of more than 22 percent in 2016. Worldwide operating income margins for 2016 were 24.0 percent, compared to 22.9 percent for 2015. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales in 2015 decreased 4.9 percent, substantially impacted by foreign currency translation, which reduced sales by 6.8 percent. Organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) was 1.3 percent, acquisitions added 0.8 percent, and divestitures reduced sales by 0.2 percent. Sales in U.S. dollars declined in Consumer by 2.2 percent, Health Care by 2.7 percent, Safety and Graphics by 3.8 percent, and in both Industrial, and Electronics and Energy, sales declined by 6.3 percent. All of 3M&#8217;s five business segments posted operating income margins of more than 21 percent in 2015. Worldwide operating income margins for 2015 were 22.9 percent, compared to 22.4 percent for 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial condition: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M generated $6.7 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, an increase of $242 million when compared to 2015. This followed a decrease of $206 million when comparing 2015 to 2014. Refer to the section entitled &#8220;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#8221; later in MD&#38;A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2016, 3M&#8217;s Board of \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nDirectors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M&#8217;s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company&#8217;s February 2014 repurchase program. This new program has no pre-established end date. In 2016, the Company purchased $3.75 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of more than $5 billion of its own stock each year in 2015 and 2014. The Company expects to purchase $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion of its own stock in 2017. In February 2017, 3M&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2017 dividend of $1.175 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 59th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M&#8217;s debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 53 percent at December 31, 2016, 48 percent at December 31, 2015, and 35 percent at December 31, 2014. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles. \n\n&#160; \n\nRaw materials: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2016, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to price decreases in crude oil and the derivative chemical feedstock markets. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans: \n\n&#160; \n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M&#8217;s pension and postretirement plans were 84 percent funded at year-end 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 90 percent funded and the international pension plans were 85 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2016 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 5.8%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2017 is 7.25%, down 0.25% from 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2016 discount rate was 4.21%, down 0.26 percentage points from the year-end 2015 discount rate of 4.47%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The plan&#8217;s funded status decreased slightly in 2016 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater rate than the plan assets returned in 2016. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans). \n\n&#160; \n\n3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2017. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2017. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2017 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $74 million pre-tax when compared to 2016. Refer to &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; within MD&#38;A and Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M&#8217;s pension and post-retirement plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nBeginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions for U.S. employees. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates of 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation is matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. The reduction in the company&#8217;s match reduced 2016 defined contribution pension expense by approximately $30 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2017 announced divestitures: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn December 2016, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) announced that it agreed to sell its identity management business. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2017. In January 2017, 3M (Safety and Graphics \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness) sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business. The Company expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $500 million in 2017 as a result of these two divestitures.

Year 2015 includes the impact of a first-quarter 2015 Japan pension curtailment gain of $17 million. Defined benefit pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\ngeneral and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A); and research, development and related expenses (R&#38;D). Refer to Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company is investing in business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, as discussed within the Overview section above, 3M incurred restructuring charges impacting operating expenses as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40 &#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n62 &#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 &#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n114 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Sales: \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 49.9 percent in 2016, a decrease of 1.0 percentage point from 2015. Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 0.7 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, cost of sales as a percent of sales benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales). Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 50.9 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from 2014. Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 1.1 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales) and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges, increased cost of sales as a percent of sales. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A) decreased $71 million, or 1.2 percent, in 2016 when compared to 2015, with 2016 results benefiting from year-on-year divestiture gains (as discussed in Note 2), foreign currency translation, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. In addition, SG&#38;A benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. SG&#38;A, measured as a percent of sales, decreased 0.1 percentage points to 20.3 percent in 2016, compared to 20.4 percent in 2015, and 20.3 percent of sales in 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&#38;A) decreased $287 million, or 4.4 percent, in 2015 when compared to 2014. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars reduced SG&#38;A expense, as evidenced by our foreign currency translation impact which reduced worldwide sales by 6.8 percent. This foreign currency translation benefit was partially offset by higher defined benefit pension and postretirement expense and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges. SG&#38;A, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.1 percentage points to 20.4 percent in 2015, compared to 20.3 percent of sales in 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses: \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&#38;D) decreased $28 million, or 1.6 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased $7 million, or 0.4 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives, including more R&#38;D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. In addition, 2016 benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense, while 2015, when compared to 2014, had higher defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. R&#38;D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in both 2016 and 2015, and 5.6 percent in 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Income: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating income margins for 2016 versus 2015, and 2015 versus 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income margin: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear ended \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n(Percent of net sales) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSame period last year \n\n&#160; \n\n22.9 % \n\n22.4 % \n\nIncrease/(decrease) in operating income margin, due to: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling price and raw material impact \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 &#160; \n\n1.6 &#160; \n\nPension and postretirement benefit costs \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 &#160; \n\n(0.5) &#160; \n\n2015 restructuring charges \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 &#160; \n\n(0.4) &#160; \n\nProductivity from restructuring \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 &#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nStrategic investments \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3) &#160; \n\n(0.3) &#160; \n\nForeign exchange impacts \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2) &#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions and divestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 &#160; \n\n(0.2) &#160; \n\nOrganic volume and utilization \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.0) &#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nLegal and other \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4) &#160; \n\n0.3 &#160; \n\nCurrent period \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 % \n\n22.9 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2016 versus Year 2015: \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income margins were 24.0 percent in 2016 compared to 22.9 percent in 2015, an increase of 1.1 percentage points. 3M benefited from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, plus lower year-on-year defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. The 2015 restructuring charges provided a favorable year-on-year comparison, in addition to productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015 restructuring actions. Acquisitions and divestitures, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, had a favorable impact on operating margins. This included solid performances from both the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions (third quarter 2015). Divestiture impacts are related to the Polyfoam business (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. Items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic investments, as 3M took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) also reduced operating income margins. Organic volume declines and related utilization impacts included the impact of lower asset utilization, primarily in the Industrial, and Electronics and Energy businesses. The &#8220;legal and other&#8221; item in the preceding table related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (all of which are discussed in Note 14). \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2015 versus Year 2014: \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income margins were 22.9 percent in 2015 compared to 22.4 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. These results included a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, and a benefit from productivity and other items. These benefits were partially offset by higher defined benefit \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\npension and postretirement benefit costs, 2015 restructuring charges, higher strategic investments, and acquisition and divestiture impacts. Strategic investments include incremental programs around disruptive R&#38;D and business transformation. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions, and the divestitures of substantially all of the library systems business, along with the license plate converting business in France. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Expense and Income: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n199 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n149 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n142 &#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(29) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(26) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(33) &#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n170 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n123 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n109 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Expense : Interest expense increased in 2016 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs. Interest expense increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014, despite significantly higher debt levels, helped by lower average interest rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. The amounts shown in the table above for interest expense are net of capitalized interest amounts of $10 million, $13 million, and $15 million, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Income: Interest income was higher in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to higher average interest rates. Interest income in 2015 was lower when compared to 2014 due to lower average cash/marketable securities balances. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvision for Income Taxes: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Percent of pre-tax income) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective tax rate \n\n&#160; \n\n28.3 % \n\n29.1 % \n\n28.9 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points. \n\nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years are impacted by many factors, as described further in Note 8, including the 2016 adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 (discussed in Note 1). \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2017 will be approximately 28 to 29 percent. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 8 for further discussion of income taxes. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n8 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n42 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which was 3M&#8217;s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As discussed in Note 6, on September 1, 2014, 3M purchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited, bringing 3M&#8217;s ownership to 100 percent. Thus, effective September 1, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced. The primary remaining noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M&#8217;s effective ownership is 75 percent. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrency Effects: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $127 million and $390 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $69 million in 2016 and increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million in 2015. Refer to Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning 3M&#8217;s hedging activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEG MENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDisclosures relating to 3M&#8217;s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 16, effective in the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments. Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer. \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and Unallocated: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to &#8220;Corporate and Unallocated,&#8221; which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 16. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $75 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. 3M&#8217;s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased by $223 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. In addition, the portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (all of which are discussed in Note 14). \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $105 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. This increase was driven by higher defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. Of this increase, $153 million was allocated to Corporate and Unallocated. Increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below table. Items which partially offset these increases within Corporate and Unallocated included higher administrative and R&#38;D cost absorption by the five business segments, resulting in less under-absorbed expense being allocated to Corporate. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Business Segments: \n\n&#160; \n\nEach of 3M&#8217;s business segments incurred restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, as indicated in the following table. \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring Pre-Tax Charge by Business Segment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFourth Quarter 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\nIndustrial \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n42 &#160; \n\nSafety and Graphics \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11 &#160; \n\nHealth Care \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9 &#160; \n\nElectronics and Energy \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12 &#160; \n\nConsumer \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3 &#160; \n\nCorporate and Unallocated \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n37 &#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n114 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nInformation related to 3M&#8217;s business segments is presented in the tables that follow.

This segment&#8217;s electronics solutions include optical film solutions for the electronic display industry; high-performance fluids and abrasives; high-temperature and display tapes; flexible circuits, which use electronic packaging and interconnection technology; and touch systems products. This segment&#8217;s energy solutions include pressure sensitive tapes and resins; electrical insulation; infrastructure products that provide both protection and detection solutions; a wide array of fiber-optic and copper-based telecommunications systems; and renewable energy component solutions for the solar and wind power industries. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe display materials and systems business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3M provides distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) LCD computer monitors 2) LCD televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones and tablets 4) notebook PCs and 5) automotive displays. The display materials and systems business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. These patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3M for a number of such products. As some of 3M&#8217;s multi-layer optical film patents expired at the end of 2013 and will expire over several years thereafter, 3M is seeing more competition in these products. 3M continues to innovate in the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products. 3M&#8217;s proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a competitive advantage to 3M independent of its patents. \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 2016 results: \n\n&#160; \n\nElectronics and Energy sales totaled $4.8 billion, down 8.1 percent in U.S. dollars.

Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M&#8217;s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M&#8217;s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 17. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of key information and discussion related to 3M&#8217;s geographic areas follow: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEurope, \n\n&#160; \n\nLatin \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nUnited \n\n&#160; \n\nAsia \n\n&#160; \n\nMiddle East \n\n&#160; \n\nAmerica/ \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStates \n\n&#160; \n\nPacific \n\n&#160; \n\n&#38; Africa \n\n&#160; \n\nCanada \n\n&#160; \n\nUnallocated \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n12,188 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,847 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,163 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,901 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n10 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n30,109 &#160; \n\n% of worldwide sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40.5 % \n\n&#160; \n\n29.4 % \n\n&#160; \n\n20.5 % \n\n&#160; \n\n9.6 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 % \n\nComponents of net sales change: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume &#8212; organic \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 % \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5) % \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.6) % \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.4) % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8) % \n\nPrice \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.1 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 &#160; \n\nOrganic local-currency sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.5 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.8) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.7 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1) &#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.7 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.7 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 &#160; \n\nDivestitures \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.6) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.7) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.3) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.4) &#160; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.5) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.4) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.2) &#160; \n\nTotal sales change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.2 % \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.1) % \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.1) % \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.7) % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.5) % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income (millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,948 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,560 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,046 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n705 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(36) &#160; \n\n$ \n\n7,223 &#160; \n\nPercent change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.4 % \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.8) % \n\n&#160; \n\n2.8 % \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.2) % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.0 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nFor total year 2016, as shown in the preceding table, worldwide sales declined 0.5 percent, with organic volume decreases of 0.8 percent and selling price increases of 0.7 percent.

The primary factor that decreased employment in 2015 related to fourth-quarter 2015 restructuring actions that impacted approximately 1,700 positions worldwide. The 2015 acquisitions of Ivera Medical Corp., Membrana, and Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. increased 2015 headcount by approximately 2,000 positions. \n\n&#160; \n\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment: \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M&#8217;s capital spending by geography has been led by the United States (59% of spending in 2016), followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America/Canada. 3M is continuing to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capability, particularly in developing economies, in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas. 3M will continue to make investments in critical developing markets, such as Brazil, China, Mexico, Panama, Poland, Southeast Asia, and Turkey. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&#38;A in the section entitled &#8220;Cash Flows from Investing Activities.&#8221; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company&#8217;s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M&#8217;s Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\nLegal Proceedings: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled &#8220;Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings&#8221; (contained in &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; in Note 14) for additional information about such estimates. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nJanuary 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation &#8212; Retirement Benefits , in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders&#8217; equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant&#8217;s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan&#8217;s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. Qualified Pension \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Pension (weighted average) \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. Postretirement Medical \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2016 Liability: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBenefit obligation \n\n&#160; \n\n4.21 % \n\n2.54 % \n\n4.08 % \n\n2017 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nService cost \n\n&#160; \n\n4.44 % \n\n2.32 % \n\n4.37 % \n\nInterest cost \n\n&#160; \n\n3.62 % \n\n2.25 % \n\n3.41 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nAnother significant element in determining the Company&#8217;s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2017 is 7.25%, 0.25% lower than 2016. Refer to Note 11 for information on how the 2016 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.16% for 2017, compared to 5.77% for 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $251 million, down from $556 million in 2015. Defined benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to increase to approximately $325 million in 2017, an increase of $74 million compared to 2016. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2017 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2016 net periodic benefit cost. The table assumes all other factors are held constant, including the slope of the discount rate yield curves. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Net Periodic Benefit Cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDiscount Rate \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected Return on Assets \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n-0.25% \n\n&#160; \n\n+0.25% \n\n&#160; \n\n-0.25% \n\n&#160; \n\n+0.25% \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. pension plans \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n31 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(28) &#160; \n\n$ \n\n36 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(36) &#160; \n\nInternational pension plans \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n23 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(19) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(14) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nAsset Impairments: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.5 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.3 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. \n\n&#160; \n\nOf the $2.3 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 2 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2016, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 10 percent. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. 3M&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. \n\n&#160; \n\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs described in Note 16, effective in the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business segments. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2016 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nAs of October 1, 2016, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety (which includes the Capital Safety acquisition), Separation and Purification (which includes the Membrana acquisition), and Traffic Safety and Security. The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $250 million of goodwill, where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3M&#8217;s market value at both December 31, 2016, and September 30, 2016, was significantly in excess of its shareholders&#8217; equity of approximately $10 billion and $12 billion, at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2016, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management&#8217;s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M&#8217;s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M&#8217;s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M&#8217;s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2016, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. \n\n&#160; \n\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2017 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe extent of 3M&#8217;s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company&#8217;s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company&#8217;s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. \n\n&#160; \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM ENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which modifies certain accounting aspects for share-based payments to employees including, among other elements, the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures, as well as classifications in the statement of cash flows. The Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016. Prospectively beginning January 1, 2016, excess tax benefits/deficiencies have been reflected as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income resulting in a $184 million tax benefit for 2016. 3M typically experiences the largest volume of stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vestings in the first quarter of its fiscal year. Refer to Note 1 for additional detail. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI TY \n\n&#160; \n\n3M continues its transition to a better-optimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace. The strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the Company to implement this strategy. Investing in 3M&#8217;s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate them. See Note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#8217;s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M&#8217;s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. Effective July 15, 2016, this program was increased to a maximum of $5 billion outstanding from a previous program size of $3 billion. \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Debt: \n\n&#160; \n\nThe strength of 3M&#8217;s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has a &#8220;well-known seasoned issuer&#8221; (WKSI) shelf registration statement, effective May 16, 2014, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future sales. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company&#8217;s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total debt was $853 million higher at December 31, 2016 when compared to December 31, 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016 and September 2016 debt issuances, partially offset by the September 2016 repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. In May 2016, 3M issued 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate medium-term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of 2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%. All of these 2016 issuances were under the medium-term notes program (Series F). As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and the 2016 debt referenced above, is approximately $11.1 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\ndenominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 10. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders&#8217; discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2016. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2016, this ratio was approximately 44 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $291 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2016. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2016, 3M had $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.35 billion was held by the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $350 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2015, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $200 million, respectively. Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 9. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure): \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Debt \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,650 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n10,797 &#160; \n\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,695 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,925 &#160; \n\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,955 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,872 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2016, net debt rose by $83 million to a net debt balance of $9.0 billion (as of December 31, 2016), as 3M progressed on its capital structure strategy. Debt levels were higher due to 2016 issuances, with this increase partially offset by the September 2016 repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were higher in both the U.S. and internationally. \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance Sheet: \n\n&#160; \n\n3M&#8217;s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. \n\n&#160; \n\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $5.507 billion at December 31, 2016, compared with $3.868 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.639 billion. Current asset balance changes increased working capital by $740 million, largely due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. Current liability balance changes increased working capital by $899 million, driven by lower short-term debt balances. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets. These measures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These measures include accounts receivable turns (defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending accounts receivable &#8211; net) and inventory turns (defined as quarterly manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory). For inventory turns calculation purposes, manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and engineering costs. Freight and engineering cost totaled $160 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $159 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounts receivable increased $238 million, or approximately 5.7%, compared with December 31, 2015, as higher December 2016 sales compared to December 2015 sales contributed to this increase. Accounts receivable turns were 6.67 at December 31, 2016, compared to 7.03 at December 31, 2015. Inventories decreased $133 million, or approximately 3.8 percent, compared with December 31, 2015. Inventory turns were 4.20 at December 30, 2016, up from 4.13 at December 31, 2015. Accounts payable increased by $104 million compared with December 31, 2015, as changes in business activity impacted balances. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure): \n\n&#160; \n\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt).

These items were partially offset by higher Company pension contributions. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $108 million in 2016, compared to working capital increases of $46 million in 2015. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the &#8220;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#8221; section. Information concerning defined benefit pension and postretirement contributions and expense is provided in Note 11, with additional discussion in the preceding Results of Operations section. Other-net in the preceding table reflects a reduction in cash flows from operating activities, partially due to divestiture gains in 2016 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the &#8220;Financial Condition and Liquidity&#8221; section. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2015, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $206 million compared to 2014. Operating cash flows decreased due to $363 million in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014, plus lower net income, which was partially offset by lower year-on-year working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $46 million in 2015, compared to increases of $306 million in 2014, with the year-on-year improvement related to lower organic volume growth. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,420) &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,461) &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,493) &#160; \n\nProceeds from sale of PP&#38;E and other assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n58 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n33 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n135 &#160; \n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(16) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,914) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(94) &#160; \n\nPurchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(163) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,300 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n754 &#160; \n\nProceeds from sale of businesses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n142 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n123 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n102 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n102 &#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(1,403) &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(2,817) &#160; \n\n$ \n\n(596) &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. Capital spending was $1.420 billion in 2016, $1.461 billion in 2015, and $1.493 billion in 2014. The Company expects 2017 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\n3M invests in renewable and maintenance programs, which pertains to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus research facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and corporate laboratory facilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2016, investments included new sites and buildings, in addition to continued expansion and sustainment of current and new facilities; specifically renewal projects done at the 3M Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. Other investments across geographies included growth, productivity, and capacity, as well as IT systems and infrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2015, investments included new sites and buildings, investments in IT, continued expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus the sustainment of existing facilities, in addition to other initiatives. Specific investments in 2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story, 400,000 square foot research facility at 3M Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. In addition, 3M continued its investments it IT systems and infrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2014, investments in growth across geographies included production equipment, new sites and buildings, capacity investments, converting, and distribution, and other growth initiatives. Other investments include IT systems and infrastructure, including an ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis. In addition, 3M began a multi-year program in the United States to renew and upgrade laboratory facilities and administrative buildings. \n\n&#160; \n\nProceeds from sale of PP&#38;E and other assets totaled $58 million in 2016, $33 million in 2015, and $135 million in 2014. Apart from the normal periodic sales of PP&#38;E, 2014 included proceeds of $114 million related to the sales of real estate and non-production equipment. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2016 related to the divestiture of the assets of the pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam) within the Industrial business segment and the completion of the divestiture of the Library business within the Safety and Graphics business segment. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business (Industrial) and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business (Electronics and Energy). \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Net proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities in 2015 were used to help fund the August 2015 acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3M&#8217;s diversified marketable securities portfolio.

Total debt was 53 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2016, 48 percent at year-end 2015, and 35 percent at year-end 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\n2016 Debt Activity: \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal debt at December 31, 2016 increased $853 million when compared to year-end 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016 debt issuances (approximately $1.1 billion at issue date exchange rates) and September 2016 debt issuances of approximately $1.75 billion. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016 along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately $0.8 million decrease), which is reflected in &#8220;Change in short-term debt&#8212;net&#8221; in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impact debt balances. \n\n&#160; \n\nProceeds from debt for 2016 primarily related to the May 2016 issuance of 500 million Euros aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate medium-term notes due February 2022, and 500 million Euros aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2031 along with the September 2016 issuances of $600 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2046 (refer to Note 10 for more detail). \n\n&#160; \n\n2015 and 2014 Debt Activity: \n\n&#160; \n\nIn both 2015 and 2014, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea in 2015. In 2015, repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition (refer to Note 2). In 2014, repayment of debt primarily includes repayment of a Eurobond in July 2014 totaling 1.025 billion Euros (approximately $1.4 billion carrying value), repayment of the three-year 66 million British Pound committed credit facility agreement entered into in December 2012, and repayment of other international debt. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2015, proceeds from debt primarily related to the May 2015 issuance of 650 million Euros aggregate principal amount of five-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2020, 600 million Euros aggregate principal amount of eight-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023, and 500 million Euros aggregate principal amount of fifteen-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2030, which in the aggregate total approximately $1.9 billion at issue date exchange rates. In addition, August 2015 issuances included $450 million aggregate principal amount of three-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2018, $500 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2020, and $550 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2025, which in aggregate total $1.5 billion. In 2014, proceeds from debt primarily related to the June 2014 issuances of $625 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2019 and $325 million aggregate principal amount of thirty-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2044, as well as the November 2014 issuances of 500 million Euros principal amount of four-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2018 and 750 million Euros principal amount of 12-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026. In addition, proceeds from debt for 2014 also include bank borrowings by international subsidiaries. Refer to Note 10 for additional discussion of debt. \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchases of Common Stock: \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company&#8217;s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2016, 3M&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M&#8217;s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company&#8217;s February 2014 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2016, the Company purchased $3.75 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases in 2015 and 2014 of more than $5 billion of its own stock in each year. The Company expects full-year 2017 gross share repurchases will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled &#8220;Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8221; in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company&#8217;s stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nDividends Paid to Shareholders: \n\n&#160; \n\nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $2.678 billion ($4.44 per share) in 2016, $2.561 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015, and $2.216 billion ($3.42 per share) in 2014. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2017, 3M&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2017 dividend of $1.175 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.70 per share and marked the 59th consecutive year of dividend increases. \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase of Noncontrolling Interest: \n\n&#160; \n\nOn September 1, 2014, 3M purchased (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.&#8217;s 25 percent interest in 3M&#8217;s consolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 90 billion Japanese Yen. Upon completion of this transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of Sumitomo 3M Limited. This was reflected as a &#8220;Purchase of noncontrolling interest&#8221; in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition, in April 2014, 3M purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3M subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as a &#8220;Purchase of noncontrolling interest&#8221; in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. \n\n&#160; \n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure): \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nfor discretionary expenditures. 3M defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2016, 2015 and 2014. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYears ended December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMajor GAAP Cash Flow Categories \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,662 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,420 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,626 &#160; \n\nNet cash used in investing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,403) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,817) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(596) &#160; \n\nNet cash used in financing activities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,626) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3,648) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(6,603) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,662 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,420 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,626 &#160; \n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&#38;E) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,420) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,461) &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1,493) &#160; \n\nFree cash flow \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,242 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,959 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,133 &#160; \n\nNet income attributable to 3M \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,050 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,833 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,956 &#160; \n\nFree cash flow conversion \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n104 % \n\n&#160; \n\n103 % \n\n&#160; \n\n104 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled &#8220;Warranties/Guarantees&#8221; in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M&#8217;s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nA summary of the Company&#8217;s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments due by year \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAfter \n\n&#160; \n\n(Millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt, including current portion (Note 10) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n11,478 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n800 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,042 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n623 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,176 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,246 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,591 &#160; \n\nInterest on long-term debt \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,936 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n224 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n221 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n210 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n205 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n195 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,881 &#160; \n\nOperating leases (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n825 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n210 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n161 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n119 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n89 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n58 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n188 &#160; \n\nCapital leases (Note 14) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n59 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n30 &#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations and other \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,361 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n946 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n189 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n123 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n54 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24 &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n25 &#160; \n\nTotal contractual cash obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n16,659 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,189 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,620 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,080 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,528 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,527 &#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,715 &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nLong-term debt payments due in 2017 and 2018 include floating rate notes totaling $150 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt), and $71 million (included in other borrowings in the long-term debt table), respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. Interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of December 31, 2016. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\ninclude both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company&#8217;s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M&#8217;s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company&#8217;s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled &#8220;Unconditional purchase obligations and other,&#8221; include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $284 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 8 for further details. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2017 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMEN TS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. \n\n&#160; \n\nRefer to Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221;, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis. \n\n&#160; \n\n"}
